This will give greater visibility to issuers seeking regulated pathways, with the RWA.io platform providing verification features such as transparent total-value-locked (TVL) data for each listing, as well as aggregated reporting.\nPartnerships and Defactor\nTogether, Valereum and RWA.io will explore how asset distribution can be expanded through partnerships, including buy-side channels made available via Defactor. This framework would allow RWA.io-originated issuances to reach Valereum's institutional network of family offices, wealth managers and funds, supporting broader investor access while aligning with regulatory standards.\nBeyond this, collaboration will include technical introductions to the Injective ecosystem, where RWA.io already maintains integrations.\nLonger-term Roadmap\nLooking ahead, the partnership intends to explore how decentralised liquidity mechanisms may complement regulated venues. This includes early-stage discussions around a decentralised exchange (DEX) model dedicated to RWAs, alongside evaluation of RWA.io's collateralisation modules, to enable holders of tokenised assets to secure loans against their positions. These concepts form part of a longer-term roadmap to expand functionality and liquidity optionality across the RWA landscape.\nGary Cottle, Group CEO of Valereum Plc, comments:\n\"Real-world assets are fast becoming a defining bridge between traditional capital markets and digital infrastructure. RWA.io is one of the most forward-thinking platforms in the sector so it makes absolute sense for us to team up with them.\nThis MoU structures our collaboration across issuance, distribution and future liquidity opportunities, uniting us in our shared ambition to drive the growth of global RWA infrastructure. Valereum's regulated marketplace and institutional relationships complement\u00a0RWA.io's technology stack and issuer base. Each step will proceed through staged technical, regulatory and commercial assessment prior to execution. We look forward to advancing this work.\"\nAdam Bouktila, Co-Founder & CSO of RWA.io, adds:\n\"We're pleased to begin this collaboration with Valereum. Their focus on compliant, regulated market infrastructure makes them an ideal partner for us as we continue building the next generation of RWA solutions.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nValereum Plc\nKarl Moss\nTel: +44 7938 767319\nInvestor Hub\nFortified Securities\nGuy Wheatley\nTel: +44 203 4117773\nAquis Corporate Adviser\nGuild Financial Advisory Limited\nRoss Andrews\nE: ross.andrews@guildfin.co.uk\nTo read more, please visit the Company's website at\nwww.vlrm.com\nor\nTo engage with Valereum directly by asking questions, watching video\nsummaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say, navigate to our\nInvestor Hub here:\nSign Up\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\nThe Company holds cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets in its treasury. Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding cryptocurrencies to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in cryptocurrencies to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in cryptocurrencies, either directly or by proxy and shareholders will have no direct access to the Company's holdings. However, the Board of Directors consider cryptocurrencies to be an appropriate store of value and potential growth and therefore appropriate for the Company. Accordingly, the Company is and intends to continue to be materially exposed to cryptocurrencies.\nThe Company is neither authorised nor regulated by the FCA, and the purchase of certain cryptocurrencies are generally unregulated in the UK. As with most other investments, the value of cryptocurrencies can go down as well as up, and therefore the value of the Company's cryptocurrencies holdings can fluctuate. The Company may not be able to realise its cryptocurrencies holdings for the same as i"

QGP has agreed to a long-term lock-in, with a limited monthly liquidity of up to 1.44% of its ongoing holding until a Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange listing.\nThe QMTNs give Valereum a strong, secure capital foundation and position the Company to accelerate its next phase of growth.\nExpanded Strategy Update\nWith institutional backing in place, Valereum has scaled up its strategy to build regulated digital market infrastructure for the future of global finance. The Company aims to unite RWA tokenisation and banking-as-a-service (BAAS), delivering end-to-end, compliant services for the digital asset era. Valereum's platform will span the full digital asset value chain, including onboarding, structuring, issuance, custody, payments, settlement, distribution and secondary trading. It will also provide market-leading crypto advisory and business development capabilities, supporting the sourcing and structuring of high-value assets such as Bitcoin and gold.\nThe Company will focus on investment across four areas:\n1. Tokenisation & issuance infrastructure\n2. Payments & banking services\n3. Custody, wallets & crypto-as-a-service APIs\n4. Distribution, advisory and origination\nTogether, these capabilities are expected to generate diversified, recurring revenues and support institutional adoption of tokenised assets.\nCapital Deployment\nAnnual income from the QMTNs will be deployed primarily into revenue-generating platforms and ecosystem investments. Initial focus areas include natural resources (royalty and streaming), real estate, crypto arbitrage and tokenisation-led strategies where Valereum has a competitive advantage. The Company is targeting equity-style returns in excess of 15% IRR, with a multiple-on-invested-capital objective of up to 5x.\nJames Bannon, Chair of Valereum Plc, comments:\n\"The Share Subscription Agreement announced on 21 January 2026, is one of the largest investments announced on the Aquis Growth Market. The completion of the transaction has added $200 million to our balance sheet and provides guaranteed annual revenues of close to $16 million per annum for five years.\nThe availability of a further $1 billion of capital gives us the ability to pursue an aggressive growth strategy over the next 18 months, pushing us on our path to a Nasdaq or NYSE listing. We have fundamentally changed the scale, ambition, and positioning of the Group.\"\nPieter Scholz, Managing Director of QGP, adds:\n\"Valereum is not a passive investment vehicle. It sits at the intersection of capital markets, digital assets, and tokenisation. QGP recognised that this is a business where asset-backed capital can be put to work, not parked on a balance sheet. This partnership gives Valereum the financial certainty to lead the charge in the evolution of real-world assets.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nValereum Plc\nKarl Moss\nTel: +44 7938 767319\nInvestor Hub\nFortified Securities\nGuy Wheatley\nTel: +44 203 4117773\nAquis Corporate Adviser\nGuild Financial Advisory Limited\nRoss Andrews\nE: ross.andrews@guildfin.co.uk\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nPlease visit the Company's website at\nwww.vlrm.com\nFor more information, and the chance to have your questions directly answered by the management team, please head to our interactive investor hub via:\nInvestor Hub\n.\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\nThe Company holds cryptocurrencies or crypto assets in its treasury. Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding cryptocurrencies to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in cryptocurrencies to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in cryptocurrencies, either directly or by proxy and shareholders will hav"
