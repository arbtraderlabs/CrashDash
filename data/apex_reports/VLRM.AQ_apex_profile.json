Subject to the approval of OTC Markets Group and the satisfaction of customary conditions.\nA successful Cross-trade on to the OTCQB Market will enable Valereum's shares to be traded in US dollars through a wide range of US brokers, providing North American investors with easier access. This increased visibility and accessibility is an integral component of Valereum's broader US capital-markets strategy, which includes the previously announced intention to progress towards a potential listing on either NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. Strengthening the Company's presence within the United States is an important step in enhancing market reach, broadening the shareholder base, and supporting long-term liquidity.\nThe application follows the completion of Valereum's divestment of the majority of its stake in London BTC Company Limited. This strategic divestment removes a regulatory constraint that had previously prevented the Company from qualifying for an OTCQB Cross-trade under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Clearing this barrier facilitates access to a broader set of international capital pools.\nThe Board views the submission of the OTCQB application as further evidence of the momentum behind Valereum's strategic repositioning. Alongside the establishment of the Valereum QGP-SP vehicle and the continued advancement of the planned USD $200m Royalty & Streaming financing, the move towards the OTCQB Market reflects the Company's vision for long-term growth.\nThe Company intends to update the market as the Cross-trade application progresses and on any material developments related to its US capital-markets strategy.\nFor further information, please contact:\nValereum Plc\nKarl Moss\nTel: +44 7938 767319\nInvestor Hub\nFortified Securities\nGuy Wheatley\nTel: +44 203 4117773\nAQSE Corporate Adviser\nFirst Sentinel Corporate Finance\nBrian Stockbridge\nTel: +44 20 3855 5551\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nPlease visit the Company's website at\nwww.vlrm.com\nFor more information, and the chance to have your questions directly answered by the management team, please head to our interactive investor hub via:\nInvestor Hub\n.\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\nThe Company holds cryptocurrencies or crypto assets in its treasury. Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding cryptocurrencies to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in cryptocurrencies to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in cryptocurrencies, either directly or by proxy and shareholders will have no direct access to the Company's holdings. However, the Board of Directors consider cryptocurrencies to be an appropriate store of value and potential growth and therefore appropriate for the Company. Accordingly, the Company is and intends to continue to be materially exposed to cryptocurrencies.\nThe Company is neither authorised nor regulated by the FCA, and the purchase of certain cryptocurrencies are generally unregulated in the UK. As with most other investments, the value of cryptocurrencies can go down as well as up, and therefore the value of the Company's cryptocurrencies holdings can fluctuate. The Company may not be able to realise its cryptocurrencies holdings for the same as it paid to acquire them or even for the value the Company currently ascribes to its cryptocurrencies positions due to market movements. Neither the Company nor investors in the Company's shares are protected by the UK's Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\nCryptocurrencies may present special risks to the Company's financial position. These risks include (but are not limited to): (i) the value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, with value dropping as quickly as it can rise. Investors in cryptocurrencies must be prepared to lose all money invested in cryptocurrencies; (ii) the cryptocurrencies market is largely unregulated. There is a risk of losing money due to risks such as cyber-attacks, financial crime and counterparty failure; (iii) the Company may not be able to sell its cryptocurrencies at will. The ability to sell cryptocurrencies depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at the relevant time. Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks and commingling of funds could cause unwanted delay; and (iv) crypto assets are characterised in some quarters by h"

This has been structured specifically to facilitate the drawdown and deployment of the USD $200m R&S capital through QGP's QMTN perpetual call certificates.\nThe establishment of V-QGP is a critical operational step towards the concluding phases of this landmark financing.\nAs part of the formation of V-QGP, the Company has issued 12,595,437 Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.001 each to QGP at par value. QGP has agreed to a full lock-up on these shares until the USD $200m R&S capital is released to Valereum.\nThe Company is pleased to confirm that all required KYC, AML, UBO and regulatory due-diligence procedures relating to QGP, V-QGP, and the associated funding structures are well advanced, progressing smoothly and with no issues identified to date. Completion of the USD $200m R&S financing remains subject only to the finalisation of customary compliance processes and execution of definitive agreements.\nUpon completion, the financing is expected to provide Valereum with a substantial long-term capital platform to accelerate its tokenisation, infrastructure and digital-asset initiatives.\nJames Bannon, Chairperson of Valereum, commented:\n\"We are delighted to report strong progress towards completion of the $200m Royalty & Streaming financing. The establishment of V-QGP, agreed share lock-up, and the advanced stage of regulatory and compliance checks all bring us closer to concluding this landmark transaction. We expect to conclude in the coming days, subject to remaining compliance and documentation, and will update the market accordingly.\"\nApplication will be made for the 12,595,437 new Ordinary Shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares in issue, to be admitted to trading on the AQSE Growth Market (\"Admission\"). Dealings are expected to commence on or around 4 December 2025.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued Ordinary Share capital will comprise 257,049,741 Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.001 each, all carrying voting rights.

Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding cryptocurrencies to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in cryptocurrencies to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in cryptocurrencies, either directly or by proxy and shareholders will have no direct access to the Company's holdings. However, the Board of Directors consider cryptocurrencies to be an appropriate store of value and potential growth and therefore appropriate for the Company. Accordingly, the Company is and intends to continue to be materially exposed to cryptocurrencies.\nThe Company is neither authorised nor regulated by the FCA, and the purchase of certain cryptocurrencies are generally unregulated in the UK. As with most other investment"
