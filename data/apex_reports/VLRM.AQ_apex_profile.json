QGP has agreed to a long-term lock-in, with a limited monthly liquidity of up to 1.44% of its ongoing holding until a Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange listing.\nThe QMTNs give Valereum a strong, secure capital foundation and position the Company to accelerate its next phase of growth.\nExpanded Strategy Update\nWith institutional backing in place, Valereum has scaled up its strategy to build regulated digital market infrastructure for the future of global finance. The Company aims to unite RWA tokenisation and banking-as-a-service (BAAS), delivering end-to-end, compliant services for the digital asset era. Valereum's platform will span the full digital asset value chain, including onboarding, structuring, issuance, custody, payments, settlement, distribution and secondary trading. It will also provide market-leading crypto advisory and business development capabilities, supporting the sourcing and structuring of high-value assets such as Bitcoin and gold.\nThe Company will focus on investment across four areas:\n1. Tokenisation & issuance infrastructure\n2. Payments & banking services\n3. Custody, wallets & crypto-as-a-service APIs\n4. Distribution, advisory and origination\nTogether, these capabilities are expected to generate diversified, recurring revenues and support institutional adoption of tokenised assets.\nCapital Deployment\nAnnual income from the QMTNs will be deployed primarily into revenue-generating platforms and ecosystem investments. Initial focus areas include natural resources (royalty and streaming), real estate, crypto arbitrage and tokenisation-led strategies where Valereum has a competitive advantage. The Company is targeting equity-style returns in excess of 15% IRR, with a multiple-on-invested-capital objective of up to 5x.\nJames Bannon, Chair of Valereum Plc, comments:\n\"The Share Subscription Agreement announced on 21 January 2026, is one of the largest investments announced on the Aquis Growth Market. The completion of the transaction has added $200 million to our balance sheet and provides guaranteed annual revenues of close to $16 million per annum for five years.\nThe availability of a further $1 billion of capital gives us the ability to pursue an aggressive growth strategy over the next 18 months, pushing us on our path to a Nasdaq or NYSE listing. We have fundamentally changed the scale, ambition, and positioning of the Group.\"\nPieter Scholz, Managing Director of QGP, adds:\n\"Valereum is not a passive investment vehicle. It sits at the intersection of capital markets, digital assets, and tokenisation. QGP recognised that this is a business where asset-backed capital can be put to work, not parked on a balance sheet. This partnership gives Valereum the financial certainty to lead the charge in the evolution of real-world assets.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nValereum Plc\nKarl Moss\nTel: +44 7938 767319\nInvestor Hub\nFortified Securities\nGuy Wheatley\nTel: +44 203 4117773\nAquis Corporate Adviser\nGuild Financial Advisory Limited\nRoss Andrews\nE: ross.andrews@guildfin.co.uk\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nPlease visit the Company's website at\nwww.vlrm.com\nFor more information, and the chance to have your questions directly answered by the management team, please head to our interactive investor hub via:\nInvestor Hub\n.\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\nThe Company holds cryptocurrencies or crypto assets in its treasury. Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding cryptocurrencies to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in cryptocurrencies to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in cryptocurrencies, either directly or by proxy and shareholders will hav"

(\"DigiShares\"), a provider of tokenisation and issuance technology for real-world assets (\"RWAs\").\nThe MoU establishes a strategic framework for collaboration across the Injective blockchain, the Valereum ecosystem (including VLRM Markets, S.A. de C.V.), and the DigiShares platform. Together, we aim to deliver compliant RWA tokenisation, secondary trading, and ecosystem development by leveraging decentralised finance infrastructure.\nKey benefits the MoU aims to deliver:\n\u25cf Injective to be a strong blockchain L1 partner with marketing to its ecosystem\n\u25cf New users from qualified retail, HNW, family office, funds and other institutions anticipated to onboard to VLRM Markets' platform (via DigiShares)\n\u25cf Increase in secondary trading & liquidity access\n\u25cf Moving closer to realising opportunities such as building an RWA DEX on Injective\nInjective Integration and RWA Issuance\nThe parties will focus on an imminent integration of Injective's EVM-compatible Layer-1 with the DigiShares primary issuance platform, enabling RWAs issued through DigiShares to be minted directly onto the Injective blockchain, subject to technical and regulatory review.\nVLRM Markets, Valereum's licensed and regulated Digital Asset Service Provider in El Salvador, will support a multi-chain issuance strategy, with issuances being minted on Injective's EVM infrastructure.\nInjective will support ecosystem development by promoting VLRM Markets within its network, providing introductions to participants in the RWA sector.\nThe collaboration opens up broader optionality beyond the Valereum platform. Through DigiShares' client base of approximately 200 issuers, the integration is expected to enable additional RWA issuances to be minted on Injective's infrastructure, independently of VLRM Markets. These issuances would benefit from exposure within the Injective ecosystem, with the potential for decentralised secondary trading and liquidity access (as supporting infrastructure becomes available, subject to regulatory and technical considerations).\nSecondary Trading, Liquidity and Market Infrastructure\nThe parties will explore secondary trading enablement for qualifying RWA tokens through Injective's on-chain order book and decentralised exchange infrastructure. This would support transparent price discovery and liquidity, complementing VLRM Markets' regulated venue which can also be extended to DigiShares' clients minting on Injective EVM. The parties will also evaluate market-making and liquidity support initiatives, alongside broader ecosystem collaboration to attract institutional and professional buy-side participation.\nStandards, Interoperability and Ecosystem Development\nValereum and Injective plan to join DigiShares and participate in the ERC-7943 standard, which is expected to be the new leading standard for RWAs and digital securities.\nAll areas of collaboration will proceed according to staged technical, regulatory and commercial assessment prior to implementation.\nExercise of Warrants\nValereum has received a notice of exercise from Fortified Securities of 1,000,000 warrants over new ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 each in the Company (the \"New Ordinary Shares\") at an exercise price of 4p per share, resulting in the Company receiving proceeds of \u00a340,000.\nApplication will be made for the 1,000,000 New Ordinary Shares which will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares in issue, to be admitted to trading on the Aquis Growth Market (\"Admission\"). Dealings are expected to commence on or around 3 February 2026.\nConditional on Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will comprise 488,932,742 ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 each, all carrying voting rights. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for determining whether they are required to notify the Company of their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company's securities pursuant to the Company's Articles.\nMark Mariampillai, Commercial Director of VLRM Markets, comments:\n\"\nI'm extremely excited about our collaboration with Injective Foundation and DigiShares, which brings together institutional-grade regulated market infrastructure, best-in-class issuance technology and a leading Layer-1 blockchain to advance real-world asset tokenisation. The initial focus will be on primary issuance, starting with Wageen and an e"

The transaction materially strengthens the Company's balance sheet, delivers immediate recurring income, and positions Valereum as a cash-flow positive, asset-backed financial technology platform.\nThe key terms of the Agreement are:\n\u25cf\nLong Term Strategic Partner -\nQGP has committed to being a long-term partner and strategic investor and will subscribe for 243,478,438 ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 in the Company (the \"Subscription Shares\").

These will generate an annual coupon of 7.95% on the outstanding principal, which shall be paid in USD or USDC quarterly from 29 March 2026 until its maturity on 31 December 2030. Valereum will therefore receive contracted income equivalent to USD 15.9 million per annum for the next 5 years.\n\u25cf\nAgreement in principle for a further USD 1 billion -\nThe Agreement includes a provision for QGP to provide the Company with up to a USD $1 billion facility to support future growth initiatives and operational expansion.\nFurther Terms of the Agreement\n\u25cf\nBoard Representation:\nSubject to satisfactory due diligence, QGP will appoint two executive directors to the Board, a further announcement will follow.\n\u25cf\nFees:\nthe Company agree to pay USD 100,000 to the subscriber on signing and a further USD 100,000 to be offset against first payment receivable by the Company from the QMTN.\n\u25cf\nPerformance Warrants:\nQGP will participate in Company's existing Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"), which permits the granting up to 30% of warrants over outstanding shares immediately vesting in equal instalments at 20p, 40p, 60p, 80p and \u00a31.00, with the pool equally split between existing performance warrant holders, Company senior executives, and QGP together with its senior executives.\n\u25cf\nIssue of Warrants:\nIn addition to the Performance Warrants, the Company will issue warrants over 10 million ordinary shares each to Pieter Scholtz, Managing Director of QGP, and Illiquid Assets Solutions Limited with an exercise price of \u00a30.001 and an expiry period of 5 years.\nRelated Party Transaction - Rule 4.6 Statement\nThe issue of warrants to Illiquid Assets Solutions Limited (\"IASL\") is a related party transaction as Gary Cottle and Grant Gischen, Directors of the Company, have an option to acquire 36% of the issued share capital of IASL (Guernsey). The Directors (excluding Gary Cottle and Grant Gischen) confirm that, having exercised reasonable care, skill and diligence, the related party transaction is fair and reasonable as far as the shareholders of the issuer are concerned.\nApplication for admission of the Further Subscription Shares to trading on Aquis\nApplication will be made for the 230,883,001 Further Subscription Shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing ordinary shares in issue, to be admitted to trading on the Aquis Growth Market (\"Admission\"). Dealings are expected to commence on or around 23 January 2026.\nConditional on Admission of the 230,883,001 Further Subscription Shares, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will be 487,932,742 ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 each, all carrying voting rights.
