Across our portfolio, we have maintained momentum in both animal health where progress in our canine study may provide translational insights relevant to future human applications as well as therapeutic development for dogs.\nThese advancements have been supported by a strengthened network of leading academic collaborators and laboratories. Together, with continued backing from international institutional investors and previously awarded government grants, this ecosystem helped accelerate Genflow's scientific and clinical development throughout 2025.\nProgram Highlights\nWe've made a number of notable strides across our programs this year, including:\n\u00b7\nDog Aging (GF-1004)\nWe made significant strides in our clinical trial for aging dogs with full administration of our investigational SIRT6-based gene therapy now completed.\nNo adverse events were reported during the dosing phase of the study, with no serious, moderate, or minor side effects observed.\nThe study which began in March 2025, is being conducted as a blinded clinical trial; an initial efficacy readout is expected in Q1 2026, including blood analyses and muscle biopsies to evaluate potential benefits related to sarcopenia, healthspan, and lifespan-associated biomarkers.\nDogs enrolled in the trial will be monitored for 180 days, with a second efficacy assessment planned at the six-month timepoint and results expected in June-July 2026 to evaluate durability and longer-term effects.\n\u00b7\nMASH (GF-1002)\nOur MASH program saw good progress in 2025. While GLP-1 therapies have addressed early-stage MASH, patients with advanced fibrosis - roughly one-third of the population - still face limited treatment options. In response, we repositioned GF-1002 to target this high-need group, leveraging its antifibrotic properties and potential to prevent progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Additionally, we have generated new pre-clinical POC data on the prevention of HCC.\nWe are now finalizing our IND package and evaluating mRNA/LNP delivery as an alternative to AAV, an approach that could enable repeat dosing and lower manufacturing costs. Encouraging data continue to support this next phase of research and development.\n\u00b7\nGlaucoma\nIn 2025, we expanded into ophthalmology, where SIRT6-based gene therapy shows promise in glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Current treatments primarily manage intraocular pressure but do little to prevent optic nerve degeneration. Our preclinical data suggest SIRT6 overexpression may protect retinal ganglion cells and preserve optic nerve function, shifting the focus from symptom control to true neuroprotection.\nWe are advancing discussions with a leading LNP partner to support delivery innovation in this space and are securing a full-service CRO to manage formulation through preclinical execution. With the global glaucoma market approaching USD $12-14 billion by the early 2030s, this represents a compelling long-term opportunity for us.\n\u00b7\nAdditional Programs\nWe continued to advance our broader pipeline and are pleased with the steady advancement of the sarcopenia program, fully consistent with our development plans. In parallel, the ExoFastTrack initiative continues to move forward, generating important data that will support and accelerate several of our other development programs.\nLooking Ahead to 2026\nAs we move into 2026, we do so with confidence, discipline, and a clear strategic focus. The coming year will emphasize rationalization of our pipeline, prioritizing programs with the strongest data, clearest paths to value creation, and highest partner interest. Central to this strategy will be the pursuit of early-stage licensing and collaboration agreements designed to generate non-dilutive funding, validate our platform externally, and support continued development without undue capital strain.\nWith multiple upcoming data readouts, an expanding partner network, and a maturing intellectual property position, we believe Genflow is well positioned to enter its next phase of growth. We remain committed to scientific excellence, capital efficiency, and long-term value creation as we work to translate our longevity platform into meaningful therapies.\nThank you for your continued support and confidence in Genflow.\nDr. Eric Leire\nFounder & Chief Executive Officer\nContacts\nGenflow Biosciences\nHarbor Access\nDr Eric Leire, CEO\nJonathan Paterson, Investor Relations\n+32-477-495-881\n+1 475 477 9401\nJonathan.Paterson@Harbor-access.com\nAbout Genflow Biosciences\nFounded in 2020, Genflow Biosciences Plc.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nGenflow Biosciences Plc\nGenflow Completes Dosing Phase of Canine Gene Therapy TrialNo Adverse Events Reported During Administration\nGenflow Biosciences Plc (LSE: GENF) (OTCQB: GENFF) (\"Genflow\" or the \"Company\"), a biotechnology company focused on extending healthspan through advanced gene therapies, today announced that all dogs enrolled in its ongoing clinical trial have successfully received the full administration of the Company's investigational SIRT6-based gene therapy.\nImportantly, no adverse events were reported during the dosing phase of the study. No serious, moderate, or minor side effects were observed, demonstrating a strong safety and tolerability profile for the therapy.\nThe study is being conducted as a blinded clinical trial and, as such, efficacy outcomes cannot yet be assessed. Genflow expects a first efficacy read\nin mid-to-late January 2026, which will include blood analyses and muscle biopsies to evaluate potential therapeutic benefits related to sarcopenia, overall healthspan, and lifespan-associated biomarkers.\nThe dogs enrolled in the trial will continue to be monitored for a total duration of 180 days. A second efficacy assessment is planned at the six-month timepoint, with results expected in June-July 2026, to evaluate durability and longer-term effects of the gene therapy.\nFollowing analysis of the efficacy data, Genflow intends to resume discussions with several animal health companies, including parties currently engaged under confidentiality and data access agreements, to explore potential early-stage licensing opportunities.\nDr. Eric Leire, CEO of Genflow, commented: \"These milestones represent an important step forward for our longevity program. The absence of any adverse events is highly encouraging and reinforces the strong safety profile of our approach. We look forward to sharing initial efficacy data in the coming months as the study progresses.\"\nContacts\nGenflow Biosciences\nHarbor Access\nDr Eric Leire, CEO\nJonathan Paterson, Investor Relations\n+32-477-495-881\n+1 475 477 9401\nJonathan.Paterson@Harbor-access.com\nAbout Genflow Biosciences\nFounded in 2020, Genflow Biosciences Plc.
