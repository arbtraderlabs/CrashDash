Accordingly, the Board wishes to seek separate authorities to dis-apply pre-emption rights in respect of the allotment of the New Shares pursuant to the Potential Equity Raise.\nThe General Meeting will be held at\nOne Heddon Street, London, W1B 4BD\nat 11am on 2 March 2026.\nAt this time, there is no certainty that the Potential Equity Raise will proceed and at this point no investors have entered into any agreements to subscribe for New Shares and the amounts and price of any Potential Equity Raise have not been agreed.

Further details of the Potential Equity Raise (if it proceeds) will be announced in due course.\nAvailability of documents\nThe circular convening the General Meeting has been published today and is available on the Company's website at\nwww.genflowbio.com\n.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nGenflow Biosciences Plc\nAdministrative Approval of \u20ac4 Million Funding Support from Wallonia Region for GF-100; and 2026 Development Priorities\nGenflow Biosciences Plc (LSE: GENF) (OTCQB: GENFF) (\"Genflow\" or the \"Company\"), a European-based biotechnology company focused on the development of gene therapies for age-related diseases, announces the administrative approval of the previously announced award of approximately \u20ac4 million in non-dilutive financial support from the Wallonia Region of Belgium, following the assenting signature of Minister Adrien Dolimont.\nThe funding, once received, will support the continued development of the Company's lead gene therapy candidate, GF-1002, for the treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (\"MASH\"). The original RNS announcing the award can be found\nhere\n.\nDisbursement of the first instalment is expected no later than May 2026. The support package spans a three-year development programme and is aligned with Genflow's existing roadmap. All project-related expenses incurred during 2025 will be eligible under the terms of the programme.\nDevelopment Priorities for 2026\nIn 2026 Genflow's strategy emphasises pipeline discipline and capital efficiency, prioritising programmes with the strongest data, the clearest paths to value creation, and the highest potential for partner engagement. Central to this approach is the pursuit of early-stage collaboration agreements designed to secure non-dilutive funding, provide external validation of the platform, and support continued development.\nWith multiple anticipated data readouts, an expanding partner dialogue, and a maturing intellectual property position, Genflow believes it is well positioned to enter its next phase of development while maintaining a focus on scientific rigour, operational execution, and long-term shareholder value creation.\nDog Aging (GF-1004)\nThe ongoing GF-1004 dog aging study, which commenced in March 2025, is being conducted as a blinded clinical trial designed to assess potential benefits related to sarcopenia, healthspan, and lifespan-associated biomarkers.\nAn initial efficacy readout is expected in the first quarter of 2026. Dogs enrolled in the study are being monitored over a 180-day period, with a second efficacy assessment planned at the six-month timepoint. Results from this later evaluation are expected in June-July 2026 and are intended to assess durability and longer-term effects.\nGlaucoma Programme\nThe Company's glaucoma programme will prioritise delivery optimisation and execution readiness.

Across our portfolio, we have maintained momentum in both animal health where progress in our canine study may provide translational insights relevant to future human applications as well as therapeutic development for dogs.\nThese advancements have been supported by a strengthened network of leading academic collaborators and laboratories. Together, with continued backing from international institutional investors and previously awarded government grants, this ecosystem helped accelerate Genflow's scientific and clinical development throughout 2025.\nProgram Highlights\nWe've made a number of notable strides across our programs this year, including:\n\u00b7\nDog Aging (GF-1004)\nWe made significant strides in our clinical trial for aging dogs with full administration of our investigational SIRT6-based gene therapy now completed.\nNo adverse events were reported during the dosing phase of the study, with no serious, moderate, or minor side effects observed.\nThe study which began in March 2025, is being conducted as a blinded clinical trial; an initial efficacy readout is expected in Q1 2026, including blood analyses and muscle biopsies to evaluate potential benefits related to sarcopenia, healthspan, and lifespan-associated biomarkers.\nDogs enrolled in the trial will be monitored for 180 days, with a second efficacy assessment planned at the six-month timepoint and results expected in June-July 2026 to evaluate durability and longer-term effects.\n\u00b7\nMASH (GF-1002)\nOur MASH program saw good progress in 2025. While GLP-1 therapies have addressed early-stage MASH, patients with advanced fibrosis - roughly one-third of the population - still face limited treatment options. In response, we repositioned GF-1002 to target this high-need group, leveraging its antifibrotic properties and potential to prevent progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Additionally, we have generated new pre-clinical POC data on the prevention of HCC.\nWe are now finalizing our IND package and evaluating mRNA/LNP delivery as an alternative to AAV, an approach that could enable repeat dosing and lower manufacturing costs. Encouraging data continue to support this next phase of research and development.\n\u00b7\nGlaucoma\nIn 2025, we expanded into ophthalmology, where SIRT6-based gene therapy shows promise in glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Current treatments primarily manage intraocular pressure but do little to prevent optic nerve degeneration. Our preclinical data suggest SIRT6 overexpression may protect retinal ganglion cells and preserve optic nerve function, shifting the focus from symptom control to true neuroprotection.\nWe are advancing discussions with a leading LNP partner to support delivery innovation in this space and are securing a full-service CRO to manage formulation through preclinical execution. With the global glaucoma market approaching USD $12-14 billion by the early 2030s, this represents a compelling long-term opportunity for us.\n\u00b7\nAdditional Programs\nWe continued to advance our broader pipeline and are pleased with the steady advancement of the sarcopenia program, fully consistent with our development plans. In parallel, the ExoFastTrack initiative continues to move forward, generating important data that will support and accelerate several of our other development programs.\nLooking Ahead to 2026\nAs we move into 2026, we do so with confidence, discipline, and a clear strategic focus. The coming year will emphasize rationalization of our pipeline, prioritizing programs with the strongest data, clearest paths to value creation, and highest partner interest. Central to this strategy will be the pursuit of early-stage licensing and collaboration agreements designed to generate non-dilutive funding, validate our platform externally, and support continued development without undue capital strain.\nWith multiple upcoming data readouts, an expanding partner network, and a maturing intellectual property position, we believe Genflow is well positioned to enter its next phase of growth. We remain committed to scientific excellence, capital efficiency, and long-term value creation as we work to translate our longevity platform into meaningful therapies.\nThank you for your continued support and confidence in Genflow.\nDr. Eric Leire\nFounder & Chief Executive Officer\nContacts\nGenflow Biosciences\nHarbor Access\nDr Eric Leire, CEO\nJonathan Paterson, Investor Relations\n+32-477-495-881\n+1 475 477 9401\nJonathan.Paterson@Harbor-access.com\nAbout Genflow Biosciences\nFounded in 2020, Genflow Biosciences Plc.
