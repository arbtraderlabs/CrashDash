This is the first drill hole of the recently commenced resource upgrade to Indicated status.\n\u00b7\nA 2.5m wide zone of visible zinc mineralisation was encountered high in the hole.\n\u00b7\nWithin this 2.5m interval, five (5) portable XRF spot samples have been taken, which average\n6.7% Zn, 2.5% Pb and 42g/t Ag\n. The highest individual spot sample for zinc is\n18.7% Zn.\nThis zone has been cut, sampled and sent to the laboratory for analysis. The pXRF equipment does not measure germanium values, but germanium will be analysed at the laboratory.\n\u00b7\nIn addition to testing these upper lodes, hole HMO-008 also aimed to test mineralisation at much greater depths. The hole is dominated by extensive fault zones, shears, brecciation and fracturing, which resulted in very slow and difficult drilling conditions.\n\u00b7\nThe entire drill core from surface to 289.00m depth is extremely altered with epidote, silica, carbonate, chlorite and clay. It is interpreted that this hole unintentionally drilled directly down one of the growth faults which are responsible for the thickening of mineralised sedimentary units.\n\u00b7\nThe position of this hole, and the presence of the growth fault provides the team with valuable geological and mineralisation knowledge, particularly of the growth fault characteristics and orientation. This is the first time that a hole has drilled directly down one of these faults, so the hole was pushed to greater depths, resulting in a very slow rate of drilling.\n\u00b7\nThe drill rig has moved to the second hole site. Drilling of future holes is expected to be faster as the position of the rig moves away from the growth fault.\n\u00b7\nA second drill rig is being sought to increase the rate of drilling productivity.\nThe cleanliness of the pXRF machine was established by measuring a BLANK reference material (a translucent quartz crystal) at the beginning of each day. A Certified Reference Material (CRM) specific to volcanic-hosted massive sulphide Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au ore (ORES 620) was measured for accuracy/precision of the pXRF machine with a reading taken at the beginning of each day.\nExamples of the intensely altered rocks within the fault zone in drill hole HMO-008.\nThe yellow/green colour is epidote alteration, the pink is iron staining\nand the white is clay/carbonate alteration.\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire, commented:\n\"This drill hole has proved extremely difficult to drill and is without question, the most fractured, broken and brecciated hole drilled at Molaoi so far. It is thought that hole HMO-008 has drilled directly down one of the growth faults. These faults have provided the geological setting for thicker mineralised lodes at depth. It was hoped that, by drilling deeper, the hole might exit the fault into strong mineralisation, however the hole remained in the fault for its entire length.\"\n\"The upper lodes were intersected in the anticipated position, and these lodes are currently being analysed. The rig has moved to the south to start the second hole, and we expect the rate of drilling to be faster. A second drill rig is also being sought to increase the company's rate of drilling.\"\n\"\nShareholders can take comfort that not all our drill holes are expected to take this length of time and hole HMO-008 is extremely unusual. The intensity of alteration, and the extremely broken ground made for difficult and slow drilling conditions. The decision to push deeper to get through the fault zone was taken, however the fault proved far more extensive than first thought. This hole has provided excellent geological information within the fault which will enable us to model the fault into our updated Indicated resource.\"\n\"We look forward to providing more updates as our drilling continues.\"\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\n:\ninfo@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\u00a0/\u00a0Ashur Joseph\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMatt Butlin\u00a0(Sales and Corporate Broking)\nCMC Markets UK Plc\u00a0(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3003 8632\nDouglas Crippen\nQualified Person Statement\nThe technical information in this announcement is based on information compiled by Mr David Price, the Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire Resources plc, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (F.AusIMM).

It is interpreted that this hole unintentionally drilled directly down one of the growth faults which are responsible for the thickening of mineralised sedimentary units.\n\u00b7\nThe position of this hole, and the presence of the growth fault provides the team with valuable geological and mineralisation knowledge, particularly of the growth fault characteristics and orientation. This is the first time that a hole has drilled directly down one of these faults, so the hole was pushed to greater depths, resulting in a very slow rate of drilling.\n\u00b7\nThe drill rig has moved to the second hole site. Drilling of future holes is expected to be faster as the position of the rig moves away from the growth fault.\n\u00b7\nA second drill rig is being sought to increase the rate of drilling productivity.\nThe cleanliness of the pXRF machine was established by measuring a BLANK reference material (a translucent quartz crystal) at the beginning of each day. A Certified Reference Material (CRM) specific to volcanic-hosted massive sulphide Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au ore (ORES 620) was measured for accuracy/precision of the pXRF machine with a reading taken at the beginning of each day.\nExamples of the intensely altered rocks within the fault zone in drill hole HMO-008.\nThe yellow/green colour is epidote alteration, the pink is iron staining\nand the white is clay/carbonate alteration.\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire, commented:\n\"This drill hole has proved extremely difficult to drill and is without question, the most fractured, broken and brecciated hole drilled at Molaoi so far. It is thought that hole HMO-008 has drilled directly down one of the growth faults. These faults have provided the geological setting for thicker mineralised lodes at depth. It was hoped that, by drilling deeper, the hole might exit the fault into strong mineralisation, however the hole remained in the fault for its entire length.\"\n\"The upper lodes were intersected in the anticipated position, and these lodes are currently being analysed. The rig has moved to the south to start the second hole, and we expect the rate of drilling to be faster. A second drill rig is also being sought to increase the company's rate of drilling.\"\n\"\nShareholders can take comfort that not all our drill holes are expected to take this length of time and hole HMO-008 is extremely unusual. The intensity of alteration, and the extremely broken ground made for difficult and slow drilling conditions. The decision to push deeper to get through the fault zone was taken, however the fault proved far more extensive than first thought. This hole has provided excellent geological information within the fault which will enable us to model the fault into our updated Indicated resource.\"\n\"We look forward to providing more updates as our drilling continues.\"\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\n:\ninfo@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\u00a0/\u00a0Ashur Joseph\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMatt Butlin\u00a0(Sales and Corporate Broking)\nCMC Markets UK Plc\u00a0(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3003 8632\nDouglas Crippen\nQualified Person Statement\nThe technical information in this announcement is based on information compiled by Mr David Price, the Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire Resources plc, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (F.AusIMM).

IN ADDITION, MARKET SOUNDINGS (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) WERE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN OF THE MATTERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, WITH THE RESULT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS BECAME AWARE OF INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED UNDER UK MAR). UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THOSE PERSONS THAT RECEIVED INSIDE INFORMATION IN A MARKET SOUNDING ARE NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION, WHICH IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n12 December 2025\nRockfire Resources plc\n(\"\nRockfire\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nProposed placing to raise \u00a33.0 million and appointment of joint broker\nRockfire Resources plc (LON: ROCK), the base metal, precious metal, and critical mineral exploration company, is pleased to announce that it has conditionally raised \u00a33.0 million (before expenses) by way of a placing (the\u00a0\"\nPlacing\n\") of\u00a0a total of 2,307,692,298\u00a0new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each in the\u00a0Company (the \"\nPlacing Shares\n\") at a\u00a0price of 0.13 pence per new Ordinary Share\u00a0(the \"\nIssue Price\n\").\nThe allotment and admission of the Placing Shares is conditional,\ninter alia\n, upon the passing of resolutions to authorise such issues and allotments and disapply pre-emption rights (the \"\nResolutions\n\") to be put to shareholders (the \"\nShareholders\n\") at a general meeting of the Company (the \"\nGeneral Meeting\n\") which is expected to be held in early January 2026, further details of which will be set out in the notice of general meeting (the \"\nNotice of GM\n\") which the Company intends to post to Shareholders early next week.\nACAM LP (\"\nACAM\n\") have subscribed for 384,615,384 new Ordinary Shares representing a consideration of\n\u00a3500,000 and following the admission of the Placing Shares, will hold a 16.06% interest in the enlarged issued share capital of the Company.\nChairman and Director, Gordon Hart, has subscribed for 7,761,538 new Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price representing a consideration of \u00a310,090 and following admission is expected to hold a 0.3% interest in the enlarged issued share capital of the Company. Non-Executive Director, Nicholas Walley, has subscribed for 30,700,000 new Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price representing a consideration of \u00a339,910. Following admission, Nicholas Walley is expected to hold a 1.96% interest in the enlarged issued share capital of the Company.\nThe Directors intend for the net proceeds of the Placing to be used, in conjunction with Rockfire's existing available cash resources, to continue the development of the Company's Molaoi zinc/silver/lead project in Greece and to fund on-going working capital requirements within the Company. An update of the zinc resource at Molaoi is anticipated in due course following additional drilling. This drilling will also result in a Maiden JORC Resource for germanium. A JORC germanium resource will be the only germanium resource known within Europe and will be unique globally.\nBackground to the Fundraise\nOn 4 September 2024, the Company announced a JORC mineral resource upgrade at the Group's Molaoi zinc/silver/lead deposit in Greece. The updated JORC resource was 500% larger than the maiden resource announced by the Group in May 2022.\nMolaoi now contains 1,090,000 tonnes of zinc, 260,000 tonnes of lead, and 19.1 million ounces of silver. Molaoi also contains one of the world's geologically rare critical metals, germanium. A preliminary germanium quantity, (not yet compliant with the JORC Code) has been calculated at 4.8 MT @ 21.9 g/t Ge (105,700 kg germanium).\nThe next stage of development of the Molaoi deposit in Greece involves moving as many zinc tonnes into the \"Indicated\" category of the JORC Code, for input to a scoping study of mining and processing options. In addition, several important drill holes will be required to close drilling gaps on a number of drill lines.\nIn order to progress the development of Molaoi, the net proceeds of the Fundraise will be applied to:\n(i) continue development of the Company's Molaoi zinc/silver/lead/Germanium project in Greece; and (ii) to fund on-going working capital requirements within the Company.\nRelated Party Transaction\nACAM is a substantial shareholder of the Company. Therefore, ACAM is deemed to be a related party pursuant to the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"\nAIM Rules\n\"). ACAM's participation in the Placing constitutes a related party transaction in accordance with Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. Accordingly, the independent directors (being David Price, Ian Staunton, Patrick Elliott and Steven Hunt) consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Allenby Capital Limited, that the terms of ACAM's participation in the Placing to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of\u00a02,307,692,298\u00a0new Ordinary Shares (the\u00a0\"\nPlacing Shares\n\") at the Issue Price. The Placing Shares are to be issued subject to shareholder approval at a General Meeting which is expected to be held on 2 January 2026.\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 18.7 per cent. to the closing mid-market price of 0.16\npence of an Ordinary Share on 11 December 2025, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this announcement.\nAppointment of Joint Broker\nRockfire is also pleased to announce the appointment of Oak Securities as the Company's joint broker with immediate effect.\nApplication to AIM\nAn application will be made to London Stock Exchange plc (\"\nLondon Stock Exchange\n\") for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. It is currently anticipated that, subject to the passing of the Resolutions at the General Meeting, admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the Placing Shares will commence on AIM, at 8.00 a.m. on or around 9 January 2026.\nThe Placing is not being underwritten by Allenby Capital Limited or any other person.\nDavid Price, Chief Executive of Rockfire, said\n:\n\"This funding will be put directly into drilling at Molaoi to achieve our upgrade from Inferred to Indicated status according to the JORC code for reporting.\n\"Rockfire has been busy over the last six months establishing a lithofacies model, completing a significant pXRF surface survey, gathering drill core samples for metallurgical purposes and undertaking a pXRF logging of historical drill core. This work has delineated additional targets north of Molaoi and have resulted in the identification of the preferred horizons for zinc mineralisation.\n\"I, and the Board, thank our new and existing investors for their understanding of the significance of the Molaoi project, as well as their vision to see the potential of the project and where Molaoi can be positioned for the future.\"\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\n:\ninfo@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Joint Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nMatt Butlin / Kelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nCMC Markets UK\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nDoulas Crippen\nOak Securities\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nJerry Keen / Robert Bell\nNotes to Editors\nRockfire Resources plc\u00a0(LON: ROCK) is a gold, base metal and critical mineral exploration company, with a high-grade zinc/lead/silver/germanium deposit in\u00a0Greece\u00a0and a portfolio of gold/copper/silver projects in\u00a0Queensland Australia.\n\u00b7\nThe\nMolaoi\ndeposit in\u00a0Greece\u00a0has a JORC Inferred Mineral Resource of 15.0 million tonnes @ 7.26% Zn, 1.75% Pb and 39.50g/t Ag, for 1.5 million tonnes of ZnEq. metal.
