This zone has readings peaking at 3.94% Zn and 5.1% Pb.\n\u00b7\nThe same zone from 198.50m depth has returned very strong individual pXRF readings for silver (325ppm Ag) and copper (1.3% Cu).\n\u00b7\nMolaoi hosts 19.1 million ounces of silver and copper is known to be throughout the mineralisation. Up to 2% Cu reports to the silver/lead flotation concentrate.\n\u00b7\nAnother zone between 238.80m and 239.15m (0.39m) averages 9.07% Zn, 3.2% Pb and 19g/t Ag. A peak reading of 14.8% Zn has been recorded in this interval.\n\u00b7\nFinally, from 258.65m to 260.00m (1.35m), a peak pXRF value of 36.55% Zn is within an average interval of 13.82% Zn.\n\u00b7\nAll pXRF readings are considered preliminary and all the intervals identified will be analysed accurately at ALS Laboratories in Ireland.\n\u00b7\nThe pXRF equipment does not measure germanium values, but germanium will be analysed at the laboratory.\n\u00b7\nAt the completion of this current drilling campaign, it is expected that Molaoi will host the only defined Inferred Resource of germanium in Europe and one of only two quoted germanium resources globally.\nThe cleanliness of the pXRF machine was established by measuring a BLANK reference material (a translucent quartz crystal) at the beginning of each day. A Certified Reference Material (CRM) specific to volcanic-hosted massive sulphide Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au ore (ORES 620) was measured for accuracy/precision of the pXRF machine with a reading taken at the beginning of each day.\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire, commented:\n\"Our drilling program continues well, and our third drill hole has successfully intersected multiple lodes predicted by our mineralisation modelling. The portable XRF readings throughout the hole continue to return high values, all of which will be confirmed by full and accurate analysis at the laboratory.\"\n\"Hole HMO-011 has commenced and is currently in progress. The Christmas period is rapidly approaching, and the drill team will shortly break for the Christmas/New Year holiday. There will be a pause in drilling from the 20th of December, with drilling expected to resume on the 12th of January. A second drill rig is expected to be in operation sometime during January 2026.\"\n\"The zinc resource at Molaoi is 2.2km long and drilling of the next 27 holes will continue in the new year. Our objective is to increase the zinc/silver/lead resource confidence from Inferred to Indicated and drilling is expected to continue throughout the first half of 2026.\"\n\"We will continue to update the market with analytical results from the laboratory in the interim.\"\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\nE-mail: info@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\u00a0/\u00a0Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nMatt Butlin\u00a0(Sales and Corporate Broking)\nCMC Markets UK Plc\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3003 8632\nDouglas Crippen\nOak Securities\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nJerry Keen\u00a0/\u00a0Robert Bell\nQualified Person Statement\nThe technical information in this announcement is based on information compiled by Mr David Price, the Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire Resources plc, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (F.AusIMM).
