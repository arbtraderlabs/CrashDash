Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issue.\n\u00b7\nSale by the Company of 443,000 shares in Sterling Metals Corp (TSXV:SAG) for approximately a gross consideration of CAD980,000. The Company will retain 400,000 shares in Sterling Metals.\nIssuance of the New Ordinary Shares\nThe Company is currently unable to issue and admit the New Ordinary Shares without either the publication of an FCA-approved prospectus or relying upon an exemption to the requirement to issue a prospectus. Consequentially, this fundraise involves a subscription by Kashif Afzal, a director of Chesterfield, for the New Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price pursuant to the employee offer exemption under Article 1(4)(i) and 1(5) (h) of the UK Prospectus Regulation.\nFollowing allotment of the New Ordinary Shares, Kashif Afzal has requested the Company's broker, Peterhouse Capital, to facilitate the immediate sale of these New Ordinary Shares and Warrants at the same Issue Price, to purchasers identified by him (the \"Purchasers\").\nWarrants\nConcurrent with the purchase of the New Ordinary Shares, the Purchasers will receive the Warrants from the Company on a 1:1 basis. The Warrants are exercisable at \u00a30.02 for a period of 5 years from the date of their issue.\nPartial Sale of Investment in Sterling Metals Corp (TSXV:SAG)\nPrior to the announcement by Sterling Metals on 29 September of a High Grade Copper Discovery at the Soo Copper Road Project Chesterfield owned 843,400 shares in Sterling Metals.\nThe announcement caused a sharp increase in both the price and trading volumes of Sterling Metals and the Company sold 443,400 shares for a total gross consideration of approximately CAD980,000.\nThe intention is to sell the remaining 400,000 shares in an orderly manner at the opportune time.\nKashif Afzal, Executive Chairman of Chesterfield commented:\n\"\nWe are delighted to welcome our new strategic investors at a material premium to our prevailing share price, evidencing their confidence and commitment to supporting a strategic transformation of Chesterfield. The investors are led by an entity affiliated with Arowana (https://arowanaco.com), a leading B Corp investment group helmed by its founder, Kevin Chin, and includes a family office connected with a ruling family in the United Arab Emirates. This group has previously co-invested in public companies with a view to transforming their future trajectories. A recent example is VivoPower International PLC (\"VivoPower\") which has experienced a share price increase exceeding 500% over the past 12 months.\nWe look forward to working closely with Kevin Chin and the broader group, to leverage their expansive global rolodex as we seek to unearth new opportunities for Chesterfield, both in terms of businesses as well as additional high calibre investors. We will update shareholders as we execute on any strategic developments.\nChesterfield is also pleased to have sold over half our remaining shares in Sterling Metals which were received upon the disposal of our Adeline asset. Sterling has recently announced spectacular drill results at its Soo Copper Project resulting in a substantial appreciation in its share price and we have been able to sell into a rising market with good volumes. Further announcements with regard to Sterling's ongoing drill campaign are expected in the near future.\nAs of today's date, we retain 400,000 shares in Sterling Metals and the Board will look to sell these in due course.\nThe fundraise together with the partial disposal of our shares in Sterling Metals means additional cash in the Company of approximately \u00a3900,000 with further proceeds expected from future orderly realisations of shares in Sterling Metals.\nThese additional funds, and the arrival of new experien",

Costs have been kept to a minimum, and the majority of Board salaries have once again been deferred, reflecting our commitment to preserving cash resources and aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.\nDuring the period, we also completed a successful equity raise, further strengthening our balance sheet and ensuring that the Company is well placed to move quickly when the right opportunity presents itself. We are grateful to our shareholders for their continued support and confidence, particularly in a challenging market environment.\nWe also completed a partial disposal of our holding in Sterling Metals, realising value while retaining a significant interest. We are excited to follow the outcome of the drilling programme that Sterling is currently undertaking, which we believe has the potential to further enhance the value of our investment.\nThe combination of tight cost control, a reinforced financial position, and a growing pipeline of potential opportunities gives us confidence that the Company is well positioned to deliver meaningful progress in the period ahead.\nFinancials\nAs is to be expected with an exploration company, for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025 the Group is reporting a pre-tax loss of\n\u00a374,712\n(six months ended 30 June 2024: loss of \u00a3187,138).

The expenditure obligations and the cost of exploration has been removed from Chesterfield's books whilst a proportion of any future success has been retained. In addition Chesterfield will enjoy a similar participation in an additional very exciting Copper project in Eastern Canada. Coupled with a direct cash receipt this represents an excellent outcome for Chesterfield shareholders.\nIn summary, post period end, Chesterfield received CAD$200,000 and an additional 8.5m shares in Sterling Metals (SAG.V). The result is that Chesterfield owns approximately 5% of Sterling Metals. In August of this year Sterling Metals provided an update on its exploration activities at the Copper Road project, the highlights of which included an extensive soil analysis, an airborne magnetic survey, LiDAR mapping and a digitisation of historical data. It is hoped that the efforts to identify priority copper exploration zones will result in attractive targets for later drilling.\nIn Cyprus activity remains modest as the company continues to evaluate the options with respect to the existing licences and possibly alternative exploration options in the country. This may include a review of the licence portfolio that means that existing licences are relinquished and other options are considered. Several operators are present in Cyprus and it has long made sense to consider some form of collaboration and efficient ways of exploration.\nThe Board continues to evaluate numerous opportunities that could complement the existing activities or possibly be in new areas and will update the market should any develop into a significant consideration.\nCosts continue to be aggressively controlled and that includes a deferral of most of the Board salaries.\nFinancials\nAs is to be expected with an exploration company, for the six-month period ended 30 June 2024 the Group is reporting a pre-tax loss of \u00a3187,138 (six months ended 30 June 2023: loss of \u00a3110,963). The Group's net cash balance as at 30 June 2024 was \u00a347,074 (30 June 2023: \u00a3348,243). Post period end, an additional \u00a3111,653 (CAD$200,000) was received in relation to the sale of Adeline.\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\u00b7 the interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the\u00a0UK;\n\u00b7 give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company;\n\u00b7 the Interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the set of interim financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n\u00b7 the Interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being the information required on related party transactions.\nThe interim report was approved by the Board of Directors and the above responsibility statement was signed on its behalf by:\nKashif Afzal\nExecutive Chairman\n26 September 2024\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nKashif Afzal, Executive Chairman\nEmail: kashif@chesterfieldplc.com\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nCharles Goodfellow\nTel:\u00a0+44 (0) 2074 690 930\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nNotes\n6 months to 30 June 2024 Unaudited\n\u00a3\n12 months to 31 December 2023 Audited\n\u00a3\n6 months to 30 June 2023 Unaudited\n\u00a3\nContinuing operations\nRevenue\n-\n-\n-\nAdministration expenses\n(261,419)\n(375,596)\n(148,386)\nOther gains\n9,661\n-\n38,011\nOperating Profit/(Loss)\n(251,758)\n(375,596)\n(110,375)\nImpairment\n-\n(897,395)\n-\nFinance cost\n-\n-\n(588)\nGain/(loss) on asset held for sale\n7\n40,123\n(368,736)\n-\nFinance income\n-\n(609)\nUnrealised fair value gain/(loss) on available for sale investments\n6\n24,497\n(269,519)\n-\nLoss before taxation\n(187,138)\n(1,911,855)\n(110,963)\nDeferred tax credit\n-\n33,138\n-\nLoss for the period\n(187,138)\n(1,878,717)\n(110,963)\nOther compre",

As a result of this transaction, Chesterfield will hold a total of 12,692,000 shares of Sterling, a 5.46% stake in the company, which is currently valued at CAD$ 761,500 (approx. \u00a3435,000). The shares are subject to certain customary lock up provisions.\nThe final sale of Chesterfield's interest in Adeline removes the uncertainty over Sterling's exercise of their option to acquire Adeline which may not have been finally known for several months. Further, the need for a significant exploration budget by Chesterfield is removed whilst retaining exposure to any exploration success. In addition, the balance sheet will be significantly strengthened with the cash and share payments received.\nSterling have recently announced the completion of the acquisition of the Copper Road Project in Ontario, and the appointment of Mark Goodman as Chairman. The company is well funded and expects strong news flow in the months ahead as it works to emerge as a leading Canadian copper explorer.\nChesterfield continues to manage its resources carefully and can now evaluate the exploration plans in Cyprus as well as additional opportunities with the confidence of this increased non dilutive funding.\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Kashif Afzal said, \"This completes an important and beneficial transaction for Chesterfield, removing both any uncertainty and our exposure to future liability and dilution from exploration expenditure, while at the same time maintaining exposure to any future success at Adeline, as well as Sterling's other promising projects in Canada. We have been impressed by the progress Sterling have made since our initial agreement with them last year, and we are confident that it is in a strong position to generate additional value for shareholders in 2024 and beyond. Further, our enhanced financial resources will allow us to look at our prospective licences in Cyprus with a different perspective and to also continue our search for new opportunities with greater financial strength. \"\n**ENDS**\nFor\nfurther information, please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nKa\nshif Afzal\n, Executive Chairman\nk\nashif@chesterfieldplc.com\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nCharles Goodfellow\nTel: +44 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This work has been carried out with the aim of reducing the need for continual equity dilution while preserving as much as possible shareholder exposure to these licences and their potential value accretion. The announcement in March of the optioning of the Adeline Project in Canada to Sterling Metals in exchange for cash and shares was an important milestone in this restructuring policy. The agreement with Sterling had an immediate beneficial impact on Chesterfield's finances, with the payment by Sterling of CAD$400,000 (\u00a3244,000), which constitutes half of the cash payment for the option, with the remainder payable in the event that Sterling opt to acquire the Adeline licences prior to 30 November 2024. This cash was accompanied by 4.5m shares in Sterling which were paid to Chesterfield, with a further 4.5m payable on the same conditions by 30 November 2024. In April, Sterling raised CAD$6.476m (\u00a33.8m) in new equity to fund its exploration plans for the summer and autumn of 2023, with a total of CAD$2.5m (\u00a31.476m) slated for expenditure on drilling and related work at Adeline. Any success at Adeline will be reflected in the value of Sterling shares that Chesterfield holds which in May constituted a 4% stake in the listed Canadian explorer.\nChesterfield\nrationalised its licence holdings in Cyprus in late 2022, reducing holdings\nfrom a total of 26 licences covering 110.42 km2 to 3 licences covering 13.39 km2\n. The Company has outlined\nplans for further exploration work on the retained properties. The Board would prefer to work with partners on these promising properties and will update shareholders as and when any formal arrangements are entered into.\nDuring the first half of 2023, the Board has continued to carry out extensive work to examine a number of possible options for the Company to make an investment into new opportunities. The goal is to find a new area of business activity that will generate significant shareholder value in the near term and to announce a new direction in Chesterfield's development by the end of 2023.\nShareholders should note that, subject to the terms that may be agreed for these opportunities, additional capital raising or additional shares being issued are possible outcomes of such a change.\nAn important part of the current overall strategy is cost savings, and the results of our efforts in this area should be clear from the accounts for the period. In addition to the cuts in exploration and related staffing and other overheads, management have been able to significantly reduce outgoings both to service providers and the Board, whose fees have been significantly cut back to \u00a32,500 monthly during the period.\nWith no debts and very low cash outlays, the Company is in a stable financial condition for the foreseeable future, and notwithstanding any further acquisitions or investments should preclude the need for a dilutive capital raise.\nFinancials\nAs is to be expected with an exploration company, for the six-month period ended 30 June 2023 the Group is reporting a pre-tax loss of \u00a3110,963 (six months ended 30 June 2022: loss of \u00a3491,607). The Group's net cash balance as at 30 June 2023 was \u00a3348,243 (30 June 2022: \u00a3663,226).\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the UK;\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company;\n\u00b7\nthe Interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the set of interim financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n\u00b7\nThe Interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being the information required on related party transactions.\nThe interim report was approved by the Board of Directors and the above responsibility statement was signed on its behalf by:\nPaul Ensor\nExecutive Chairman\n15 September 2023\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\n",

Sterling will be exploring two sets of highly prospective licences in eastern Canada, Adeline, and Sail Pond. Having successfully raised in April a total CAD$6.476m (\u00a33.8m) through equity fundraisings, work has commenced on both properties, starting on 5 June with a 2,000 metre drill programme at Sail Pond. During 2023 Sterling expects to spend CAD$1.75m (\u00a31.02m) in total at Sail Pond, and at Adeline will spend a total of CAD$2.5m (\u00a31.47m) on an airborne survey and a 2,500 metre drill campaign. For more details please refer to the Sterling Metals website (\nhttps://sterlingmetals.ca/\n).\nChesterfield shareholders will continue to enjoy the benefits of any exploration success at Adeline, whilst not needing to raise capital to do so and also diversifying risk with the added exposure to Sail Pond.\nCyprus\nIn late 2022 the Company rationalised its licence holdings in Cyprus, reducing holdings\nfrom a total of 26 licences covering 110.42 km2 to 3 licences covering 13.39 km2. This change was made in order to reduce holding costs on the relinquished ground, while at the same time not losing focus on the valuable work and data collected on the licences retained. The Company has formulated plans for further exploration work on the retained properties, and remains in preliminary discussions with potential joint venture partners to carry out this work. The Board would prefer to work with partners on these promising properties and will update shareholders as and when any formal arrangements are entered into.\nOther Opportunities\nThe Board aims to make the most of the Company's resources through what it aims to be a transformational investment into a new area of activity. Extensive work is underway to consider a number of possible options on offer. The most important criterion behind this work will be to generate significant shareholder value in the near term, and the goal is to be able to announce the direction of this next phase in Chesterfield's development by the end of 2023. Shareholders should note that, subject to the terms that may be agreed for these opportunities, additional capital raising or additional shares being issued are possible outcomes.\nCash management\nBoth for fiscal prudence and in order to improve the Company's position with regard to any future investment, the Board has made significant cut backs in all aspects of running costs. These cuts have included significant reductions in payments to Board members which have been running at \u00a32,500 monthly in aggregate for the last several months. This contrasts with the payments to the previously larger Board that totalled \u00a3285,906 during 2022. With no debts and very low cash outlays, the Company is in a stable financial condition for the foreseeable future, and notwithstanding any further acquisitions or investments should preclude the need for a dilutive capital raise.\nWebsite\nThe Company's website address has recently moved to a new address: https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said, \"Since the new management took over in Autumn 2022 we have not wavered in our emphasis on radically reducing current outlays and avoiding future spending commitments that we were not confident we could underwrite without raising new equity. Our focus now is primarily on finding opportunities that will be the right fit with our resources and capital structure that will generate shareholder value once agreed and transacted.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nhttps://www.chesterfieldplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Sterling raised a total of CAD$6.476m (\u00a33.8m) through equity issues which were completed and announced on 17 April. These funds have brought Sterling's overall cash position to total CAD$7.75m (\u00a34.5m) and have put it into a strong position from which to pursue an aggressive exploration campaign with a budget of CAD$4.25m (\u00a32.5m) this year. Sterling has earmarked CAD$2m (\u00a31.18m) for a 2,500 metre drill campaign this summer in Adeline, in addition to the CAD$500,000 (\u00a3296,000) airborne survey planned over the licence area. In addition, Sterling will be spending CAD$750,000 (\u00a3443,790) on a 2,500 metre drill programme on its Sail Pond licence area as well as CAD$1m (\u00a3591,715) on general technical services.\nChesterfield owns 4.5m shares in Sterling which it received in addition to CAD$400,000 (\u00a3236,686) according to the agreement announced on 6 March. According to that agreement, Sterling agreed to\npurchase an option to acquire full ownership and rights over the Adeline project in exchange for these payments. In the event that Sterling decides to complete its purchase of the Adeline project, it will pay Chesterfield a further 4.5m shares and CAD$400,000\n(\u00a3236,686) no later than 20 November 2024. As of close of business on 15 May, Chesterfield's stake in Sterling was valued at CAD$562,500 (\u00a3332,840). To put this into context, this means Chesterfield holds a 4% stake in Sterling which at close of business on 15 May had a market capitalisation of CAD$13.96m (\u00a38.26m), a valuation amply supported by its strong cash position and nothwithstanding the imminent exploration activity.\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said, \"Sterling's success in fundraising in difficult markets is very good news for Chesterfield shareholders. It is equally gratifying to see Sterling give Adeline the emphasis that it deserves within its overall budget and we very much look forward to hearing of the results of their ambitious schedule of work there and at Sail Pond in the coming few months. Chesterfield shareholders are closely aligned to potential results of this extensive work on both projects through its shares in Sterling.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

According to the agreement Sterling Metals will purchase an option to acquire full ownership and rights over the project in exchange for a series of payments of cash and shares. As a result, Chesterfield will become a significant shareholder in Sterling, giving Chesterfield shareholders a stake both in the upside of the Adeline property and Sterling's 100% owned high grade, district scale, Sail Pond silver-polymetallic property located approximately 500km from Adeline.\nThe main elements of the agreement are as follows:\n1) Sterling will pay a total of CAD$800,000 (\u00a3490,000) in three separate payments: CAD$100,000 (\u00a362,250) with immediate effect, and CAD$300,000 (\u00a3183,750) following receipt of permission from the TSX-V authorities to complete the deal, and a final CAD$400,000 (\u00a3230,000) to be paid on or before 30 November 2024.\n2)\nSterling will issue a total of 9m shares to Chesterfield in two equal lots of 4.5m, the first following and subject to receipt of permission from the TSX-V authorities to complete the deal, and the second tranche to be issued on or before 30 November 2024.\nChesterfield's ability to sell its shares in Sterling will be restricted according to certain terms detailed in the agreement.\n3) The final CAD$400,000 and the second tranche of 4.5m shares are payable should Sterling decide to exercise its option to acquire the Adeline licences at any time prior to 30 November 2024.\nSterling Metals is a listed exploration company with with a market capitalization of CAD17.35m (\u00a310.65m), it is the holder of\nthe Sail Pond project a 135km2 set of licences in Newfoundland, eastern Canada. Discovered at the end of 2016, the Sail Pond project consists of a 12 km anomaly with strong surface showings of silver, copper, lead, antimony and zinc. Over the last two years Sterling has uncovered a 1km footprint at the south end of the anomaly which includes the 400m x 200m x 150m Heimdall zone as well as a new zone, 500m north of Heimdall where drilling intercepted a 100% sulfosalt vein grading 1,564g/t Ag, 8.33% Cu, 12.83% Pb, 2.74% Sb, and 3.93% Zn (A long section has been provided below in Figure 1). Sterling is currently running a deep Orion survey (\na structural and mineralised mapping tool that reaches down to 2km depth)\nto locate the source of this large footprint and plans to drill the property in 2023. Sterling has a cash position at present of CAD$3.5m (\u00a3183,750).\nFigure 1: Longitudinal section looking west showing drilling with silver equivalent mineralization on drillholes\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said, \"During the competitive process that we undertook in September 2022 we got to know Sterling well due to their great interest in Adeline and we are delighted to have reached this agreement with them. Through this new relationship, Chesterfield will have a stake in what in effect becomes a regional play for potentially two highly prospective licence areas in eastern Canada, in both cases originally sourced from the same renowned group, Altius Minerals. We look forward to working in partnership with Sterling to deliver the best possible value from Adeline to our shareholders.\"\nSterling Metals CEO Mathew Wilson said, \"We are thrilled to partner with Chesterfield and begin work on the Adeline project. The synergy due to the Altius ownership, our advisor Dr. Neil O'Brien, and the close proximity to our Sail Pond asset makes this an ideal fit and we anticipate limited friction in beginning our exploration work. It is rare to find one, let alone two \"company making\" assets in a junior explorer.The exposure for investors to the significant potential for large scale critical metals projects in such a wonderful jurisdiction as Newfoundland and Labrador makes this partnership an immediate value add for both Sterling and Chesterfield shareholders. This will be an exciting year.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

(\"PAC.V\") (\"Pacton\") has advised Chesterfield Resources PLC that it has determined not to proceed with the purchase of the Adeline project on the terms announced on 19 October 2022. This is in spite of the fact that investor interest in the Adeline project, as solicited by Pacton, has been robust. Further, Pacton's technical team determined high prospectivity at Adeline and had a thorough plan to explore in 2023 and beyond.\nChesterfield will continue the process started last year to solicit interest in Adeline and remain hopeful that an alternative buyer will emerge from that process, which may be assisted by the results of the extensive technical work undertaken by Pacton on the property and improved commodity and precious metal prices since October 2022.\nThe Company will update the market with any further material developments but cannot at this time guide as to the likely timing of a transaction.\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said, \"Pacton's bid for Adeline was accepted following a thorough process which drew interest and indicative offers from a variety of operators who met our criteria, including the ability to efficiently fund and execute a thorough exploration programme at Adeline. We are hopeful that this process and the discussions that we had in September last year can be quickly revived to achieve our goals for Adeline.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\n**ENDS**\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

At Orchard, which has a history small scale trial mining in the 1950s, drilling in 2018 and 2021 encountered semi-massive sulphides.\nPlans, currently being developed, include more drilling to continue to test the mineralised system for massive sulphide with potential in all directions. The scope and timing of the plans will depend on factors that will include the sale of the Adeline interests and prevailing market conditions. Chesterfield will also entertain proposals for joint venture or direct investment in the Cyprus licences though no such discussions are currently advanced. The Company will in due course update the market on the specifics of its plans for exploration work which it aims to carry out in 2023.\nThe Company is also rationalising its large exploration licence portfolio in Cyprus to reduce unnecessary spending and potential shareholder dilution while continuing to advance its most highly prospective retained Westline and Orchard assets. In line with this approach Chesterfield has recently informed the relevant authorities in Cyprus of its plan to surrender a number of licences as they expire over the next six months. As the affected licences expire in the coming months, Chesterfield's portfolio of licences will be reduced from a total of 26 licences covering 110.42 km2 to 3 licences (licence numbers: AE4664, AE4672 and AE4673) covering 13.39 km2. This will allow the Company to focus on the most prospective licences and also mitigate the need for substantial costs that would be payable for the renewal of licences that were likely to be of lesser interest.\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said\n, \"We are excited by the potential for additional exploration in 2023 in the properties that we are retaining and the decision to reduce our portfolio overall will make it easier for us to devote the resources to them that they deserve. Before giving up these extensive non-core properties we had more licences than we could possibly explore, with a considerable and potentially growing holding cost and required expenditures in the near future.\"\nUpdate on Sale of Canadian Licences\nChesterfield entered into an Agreement with Pacton Gold Inc\n(\"PAC.V\") (\"Pacton\")\nas announced on 19 October 2022.\nThe agreement is conditional, inter alia upon the approval by the relevant authorities at the\nTSX Venture Exchange, and a successful equity raise by Pacton. The Company is advised that progress is being made on all fronts and we hope to advise the market further in due course\n.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\n**ENDS**\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "full_content": "19 Oct 2022 07:00\nRNS Number : 3314D\nChesterfield Resources PLC\n19 October 2022\nChesterfield Resources PLC / EPIC: CHF / Market: LSE / Sector: Mining\n19 October 2022\nCHESTERFIELD RESOURCES PLC\n(\"Chesterfield\" or the \"Company\")\nSALE OF ADELINE PROJECT FOR CASH AND SIGNIFICANT STAKE IN CANADIAN EXPLORER\nChesterfield Resources plc is pleased to announce that it has signed an Agreement with Pacton Gold Inc. (\"PAC.V\") (\"Pacton\"), a TSX-V listed exploration company with regard to Chesterfield's Adeline project in Labrador. The agreement is conditional, inter alia upon the approval by the relevant authorities at the TSX Venture Exchange, and a successful equity raise by Pacton.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Chesterfield's Canadian subsidiary Chesterfield (Canada) Inc. will sell its 100% interest in its Adeline licences to Pacton in exchange for a combination of cash and shares in Pacton. As a result Chesterfield (Canada) Inc. will become a significant shareholder in Pacton, obtain a seat on Pacton's board and will actively participate in the development of the Adeline project. Chesterfield's board anticipates that the development of the Adeline project will therefore be able to progress much more quickly and effectively than would have been the case had Chesterfield pursued the funding and carried out this work on its own. Chesterfield shareholders will continue to have exposure to any discovery at Adeline through Chesterfield (Canada) Inc's 19.99% post funding dilution stake in Pacton. For reference, Pacton is currently valued at CAD12.99m (\u00a38.4m). Chesterfield's ability to sell its shares in Pacton will be restricted according to certain terms detailed in the agreement and all payments are subject to potential tax liability in Canada.\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said, \"This agreement follows a process during which the Adeline project was reviewed by a number of potentially interested groups. Our pre-requisites in choosing a partner included the following: 1) the ability to promptly fund the next stage of work in Labrador 2) technical competence to carry out and successfully complete all necessary work to yield the quickest and best possible results from our Adeline licences and 3) a track record of past success in previous similar endeavours. Pacton fulfils all of these criteria. This is a good deal for Chesterfield in many respects, as it values Adeline on fair terms, whilst also potentially capturing additional value as the project is advanced. We look forward to working closely with Pacton to deliver the best possible value from Adeline to our shareholders as quickly as possible.\"\nPacton President and CEO Nav Dhaliwal said \"Proven high-grade showings and drill ready targets make Adeline an ideal property for rapid exploration. We have an award winning in-house technical team and management with a track record for increasing shareholder wealth. With the early-stage exploration already complete, Pacton will be looking to commence drilling this remarkable property at the earliest opportunity.\"\nKEY COMMERCIAL TERMS\n\u00b7\nPacton will issue consideration shares to Chesterfield equal to a 19.99% share\nof the post dilution outstanding share capital of Pacton.\n\u00b7\nPacton will pay Chesterfield a total of CAD1.25m (\u00a3804,000) in staged payments over a period of 12 months.\n\u00b7\nPacton and Chesterfield will agree a development programme to be carried out by Pacton.\n\u00b7\nChesterfield will advise Pacton for a defined handover period post completion and will receive additional compensation of CAD300,000 (c \u00a3193,000) for this work of during the transition period.\nABOUT PACTON GOLD\nPacton is a Canadian exploration company with key strategic partners focused on the exploration and development of high-grade mineral resource properties in Ontario, Canada. The Company also owns a strategic portfolio of prospective projects in Western Australia and Canada.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

I had not previously been on their website until I first looked at it yesterday to help make my reply to @shanders20 . Usually on Company websites they state the reference date for when the % holdings are applicable so there is clarity but CHF has not. Anyway I will get on and fire an email off to them tomorrow to see if this matter can be quickly resolved, as we currently have what appears to be conflicting info from different Company generated sources.",

Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",

Kashif Afzal has China links and is already a Blockbase Asia director. Link to the Blockbase Asia website below (I think), lots of AI and Fintech... China seem active in UK markets as seen on SCGL. Just guessing really, as the new direction news is taking a long time to come, but still hoping it will be transformational for CHF. Current mcap of only \u00a3500k, also limited free float of shares here with only 130 mil shares in issue. CHF main market listing is probably worth the current mcap as a shell. \"\"The Board aims to make the most of the Company's resources through what it aims to be a transformational investment into a new area of activity. Extensive work is underway to consider a number of possible options on offer. The most important criterion behind this work will be to generate significant shareholder value in the near term\". \"Mr Afzal, is a British businessman based in the UAE, and a graduate of Oxford University and the professional programme at the Camborne School of Mines. In addition to Juniper International FZ LLC, Mr Afzal is an advisor to a number of institutional and family office investors and a Director of Blockbase Asia and Bosonic Energy. He will be a welcome addition to the Board of Chesterfield as his experience and network in the UAE will assist in the identification and financing of additional opportunities for the company\" https://blockbase.co/",

CHF should acquire a good drill ready gold project, get some technical people in and grow from there, the timing is good. Just avoid Cyprus again and the BS that went on before.",

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

Usually on Company websites they state the reference date for when the % holdings are applicable so there is clarity but CHF has not. Anyway I will get on and fire an email off to them tomorrow to see if this matter can be quickly resolved, as we currently have what appears to be conflicting info from different Company generated sources.",

Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",

Link to the Blockbase Asia website below (I think), lots of AI and Fintech...  China seem active in UK markets as seen on SCGL. Just guessing really, as the new direction news is taking a long time to come, but still hoping it will be transformational for CHF. Current mcap of only \u00a3500k, also limited free float of shares here with only 130 mil shares in issue. CHF main market listing is probably worth the current mcap as a shell. \"\"The Board aims to make the most of the Company's resources through what it aims to be a transformational investment into a new area of activity. Extensive work is underway to consider a number of possible options on offer. The most important criterion behind this work will be to generate significant shareholder value in the near term\". \"Mr Afzal, is a British businessman based in the UAE, and a graduate of Oxford University and the professional programme at the Camborne School of Mines. In addition to Juniper International FZ LLC, Mr Afzal is an advisor to a number of institutional and family office investors and a Director of Blockbase Asia and Bosonic Energy. He will be a welcome addition to the Board of Chesterfield as his experience and network in the UAE will assist in the identification and financing of additional opportunities for the company\" https://blockbase.co/",

Kashif Afzal has China links and is already a Blockbase Asia director. Link to the Blockbase Asia website below (I think), lots of AI and Fintech... China seem active in UK markets as seen on SCGL. Just guessing really, as the new direction news is taking a long time to come, but still hoping it will be transformational for CHF. Current mcap of only \u00a3500k, also limited free float of shares here with only 130 mil shares in issue. CHF main market listing is probably worth the current mcap as a shell. \"\"The Board aims to make the most of the Company's resources through what it aims to be a transformational investment into a new area of activity. Extensive work is underway to consider a number of possible options on offer. The most important criterion behind this work will be to generate significant shareholder value in the near term\". \"Mr Afzal, is a British businessman based in the UAE, and a graduate of Oxford University and the professional programme at the Camborne School of Mines. In addition to Juniper International FZ LLC, Mr Afzal is an advisor to a number of institutional and family office investors and a Director of Blockbase Asia and Bosonic Energy. He will be a welcome addition to the Board of Chesterfield as his experience and network in the UAE will assist in the identification and financing of additional opportunities for the company\" https://blockbase.co/",

Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",

Usually on Company websites they state the reference date for when the % holdings are applicable so there is clarity but CHF has not. Anyway I will get on and fire an email off to them tomorrow to see if this matter can be quickly resolved, as we currently have what appears to be conflicting info from different Company generated sources.",

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

Details on the investment: Company: Tembo, a subsidiary of Kevin Chin's company VivoPower, received a strategic direct investment. Investment Amount: An initial investment commitment of US$2.5 million was secured, with an option to increase it up to US$10 million. Investor: The investment came from a private investment office backed by a member of the Al Maktoum family. The Al Maktoum family's wealth, largely stemming from the personal fortune of Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is based on a vast and diversified portfolio. While the exact net worth of the entire family is difficult to pinpoint, some sources estimate Sheikh Mohammed's individual net worth to be around $14 to $18 billion as of late 2024 and mid-2025 CHF \u00a32.5m  MCAP almost a Shell, already with some cash in the bank",

Usually on Company websites they state the reference date for when the % holdings are applicable so there is clarity but CHF has not.

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

He will be a welcome addition to the Board of Chesterfield as his experience and network in the UAE will assist in the identification and financing of additional opportunities for the company\" Looks like Kashif Afzal is now delivering for Chesterfield, we still don't know the real details of the new direction yet, although it has been in the making for some time now, we also don't know how any further financing from the UAE would unfold. Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",

          "content": "Hi @shanders20 \u2026.You have raised an interesting topic. My related feedback is in summary as follows: In Sept 2023 there was an RNS (see link below) informing of the pending Sale of Polymetal\u2019s entire stock holding in Chesterfield Resources to Juniper International (refer below RNS link), which is a Company that is 100% owned by the current Chesterfield Resources Executive Chairman (Kashif Afzal). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding-bk4hmrclpom8jou.html However, now we are over two years later and in a recent RNS (see link below) there was an interesting footnote given below the shares holdings table written in italics that says that this stock Sale still remains to be fully completed, due to Regulatory considerations. Perhaps it is the Russian aspect that had existed for Polymetal prior to its 2023 de-listing from the LSE that is the root cause for this long standing delay to the Chesterfield Resources stock Sale closure? (pure conjecture on my part). https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/issue-of-equity-disposal-of-investments-cj5f7hhgwh449un.html Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Chesterfield Resources website\u2019s current content is showing Juniper International as major share holder (with no mention of Polymetal), which would imply that the sale of the Chesterfield Resources stock has completed. Perhaps it has very recently happened in the past two weeks since the above linked recent RNS was issued? https://www.chesterfieldplc.com/investors/shareholders-capital-structure/ It would be beneficial to get the 100% formal confirmation via RNS of the completion of the Chesterfield Resources stock sale, so as to be 100% sure that the current CEO is indeed officially a major Chesterfield Resources stock holder and therefore we can envisage him to positively develop the future business of the Company with full alignment to his fellow shareholders. I would therefore recommend that holders reading this thread take the opportunity to write to the Company to seek clarity on this important matter. I shall be doing so this coming week and if many others do likewise then it can be expected that the CEO will positively and timely respond.",

Exciting times for CHF, the market cap is still low, and Ceres Digital now around 13% ownership. also have the equivalent volume of shares options available in warrants priced at 2p which is in sight, if Ceres take them, then that would see them owning roughly a 1/4 of Chesterfield.",
