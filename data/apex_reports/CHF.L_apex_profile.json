          "content": "9 Oct 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 6311C\nChesterfield Resources PLC\n09 October 2025\nNOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN OR INTO AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, THE UNITED STATES, ANY TERRITORY OR POSSESSION THEREOF OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO\u00a0SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.\n9 October 2025\nChesterfield Resources plc\n(\"Chesterfield\" or the \"Company\")\nSubscription to raise\n\u00a3375,192 from UAE based Investors and CAD$900,000 Proceeds from Partial Sale of Investment in Sterling Metals Corp (TSXV:SAG)\nChesterfield Resources plc (LSE: CHF) is pleased to announce that it has raised gross proceeds of\u00a0\u00a3375,192 via an allotment to Kashif Afzal, a Director of the Company, of 31,266,000 new ordinary shares (\"New Ordinary Shares\") at an issue price of \u00a30.012 per share (the \"Issue Price\").\nHighlights\n\u00b7\n\u00a3375,192 raised at a price of\u00a0\u00a30.012 per New Ordinary Share (the \"Issue Price\"), representing a premium of approximately 50% to the closing mid-market price at 8 Oct 2025.\u00a0.\n\u00b7\nPurchaser (as defined below) will receive one warrant for each New Ordinary Share exercisable at \u00a30.02 (the \" Warrants\"). Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issue.\n\u00b7\nSale by the Company of 443,000 shares in Sterling Metals Corp (TSXV:SAG) for approximately a gross consideration of CAD980,000. The Company will retain 400,000 shares in Sterling Metals.\nIssuance of the New Ordinary Shares\nThe Company is currently unable to issue and admit the New Ordinary Shares without either the publication of an FCA-approved prospectus or relying upon an exemption to the requirement to issue a prospectus. Consequentially, this fundraise involves a subscription by Kashif Afzal, a director of Chesterfield, for the New Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price pursuant to the employee offer exemption under Article 1(4)(i) and 1(5) (h) of the UK Prospectus Regulation.\nFollowing allotment of the New Ordinary Shares, Kashif Afzal has requested the Company's broker, Peterhouse Capital, to facilitate the immediate sale of these New Ordinary Shares and Warrants at the same Issue Price, to purchasers identified by him (the \"Purchasers\").\nWarrants\nConcurrent with the purchase of the New Ordinary Shares, the Purchasers will receive the Warrants from the Company on a 1:1 basis. The Warrants are exercisable at \u00a30.02 for a period of 5 years from the date of their issue.\nPartial Sale of Investment in Sterling Metals Corp (TSXV:SAG)\nPrior to the announcement by Sterling Metals on 29 September of a High Grade Copper Discovery at the Soo Copper Road Project Chesterfield owned 843,400 shares in Sterling Metals.\nThe announcement caused a sharp increase in both the price and trading volumes of Sterling Metals and the Company sold 443,400 shares for a total gross consideration of approximately CAD980,000.\nThe intention is to sell the remaining 400,000 shares in an orderly manner at the opportune time.\nKashif Afzal, Executive Chairman of Chesterfield commented:\n\"\nWe are delighted to welcome our new strategic investors at a material premium to our prevailing share price, evidencing their confidence and commitment to supporting a strategic transformation of Chesterfield. The investors are led by an entity affiliated with Arowana (https://arowanaco.com), a leading B Corp investment group helmed by its founder, Kevin Chin, and includes a family office connected with a ruling family in the United Arab Emirates. This group has previously co-invested in public companies with a view to transforming their future trajectories. A recent example is VivoPower International PLC (\"VivoPower\") which has experienced a share price increase exceeding 500% over the past 12 months.\nWe look forward to working closely with Kevin Chin and the broader group, to leverage their expansive global rolodex as we seek to unearth new opportunities for Chesterfield, both in terms of businesses as well as additional high calibre investors. We will update shareholders as we execute on any strategic developments.\nChesterfield is also pleased to have sold over half our remaining shares in Sterling Metals which were received upon the disposal of our Adeline asset. Sterling has recently announced spectacular drill results at its Soo Copper Project resulting in a substantial appreciation in its share price and we have been able to sell into a rising market with good volumes. Further announcements with regard to Sterling's ongoing drill campaign are expected in the near future.\nAs of today's date, we retain 400,000 shares in Sterling Metals and the Board will look to sell these in due course.\nThe fundraise together with the partial disposal of our shares in Sterling Metals means additional cash in the Company of approximately \u00a3900,000 with further proceeds expected from future orderly realisations of shares in Sterling Metals.\nThese additional funds, and the arrival of new experienced and committed shareholders above, will greatly enhance the range and quality of opportunities and improve upon the potential terms that the Company can execute. We are excited about the next stage in the journey of Chesterfield\n.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nThe New Ordinary Shares will rank pari passu with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares. Application will be made to the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the LSE for the 31,266,000 New Ordinary Shares admitted to the equity shares (transition) category of the Official List of the FCA and to trading on the main market for listed securities of London Stock Exchange plc (\"Admission\"), with Admission expected to occur on or as soon as practical after 12 October 2025.\nOn Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 187,594,311 Ordinary Shares, with each Ordinary Share carrying the right to one vote. Accordingly, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 187,594,311 and this figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe New Ordinary Shares will represent 16.7% of the new enlarged share capital of the Company.\nFollowing the issuance of the New Ordinary Shares, the Directors holdings will be as follows:\nName\nNumber of Shares Held\n% of Issued Share Capital\nJuniper International FZ LLC*\n25,333,334\n13.5\nPaul Ensor\n2,172,841\n1.2\nAjay Kejriwal\n150,000\n0.1\n*\nKashif Afzal, Executive Chairman of the Company owns 100% of Juniper International FZ LLC. The final completion of the sale of the 23,333,334 shares from Polymetal International plc to\u00a0Juniper International FZ LLC\u00a0remains subject to certain regulatory considerations and it is expected that formal notification will be issued upon completion of the remaining formalities as announced on\u00a025 September 2023.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information.

At Orchard, which has a history small scale trial mining in the 1950s, drilling in 2018 and 2021 encountered semi-massive sulphides.\nPlans, currently being developed, include more drilling to continue to test the mineralised system for massive sulphide with potential in all directions. The scope and timing of the plans will depend on factors that will include the sale of the Adeline interests and prevailing market conditions. Chesterfield will also entertain proposals for joint venture or direct investment in the Cyprus licences though no such discussions are currently advanced. The Company will in due course update the market on the specifics of its plans for exploration work which it aims to carry out in 2023.\nThe Company is also rationalising its large exploration licence portfolio in Cyprus to reduce unnecessary spending and potential shareholder dilution while continuing to advance its most highly prospective retained Westline and Orchard assets. In line with this approach Chesterfield has recently informed the relevant authorities in Cyprus of its plan to surrender a number of licences as they expire over the next six months. As the affected licences expire in the coming months, Chesterfield's portfolio of licences will be reduced from a total of 26 licences covering 110.42 km2 to 3 licences (licence numbers: AE4664, AE4672 and AE4673) covering 13.39 km2. This will allow the Company to focus on the most prospective licences and also mitigate the need for substantial costs that would be payable for the renewal of licences that were likely to be of lesser interest.\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said\n, \"We are excited by the potential for additional exploration in 2023 in the properties that we are retaining and the decision to reduce our portfolio overall will make it easier for us to devote the resources to them that they deserve. Before giving up these extensive non-core properties we had more licences than we could possibly explore, with a considerable and potentially growing holding cost and required expenditures in the near future.\"\nUpdate on Sale of Canadian Licences\nChesterfield entered into an Agreement with Pacton Gold Inc\n(\"PAC.V\") (\"Pacton\")\nas announced on 19 October 2022.\nThe agreement is conditional, inter alia upon the approval by the relevant authorities at the\nTSX Venture Exchange, and a successful equity raise by Pacton. The Company is advised that progress is being made on all fronts and we hope to advise the market further in due course\n.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\n**ENDS**\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As a result, Chesterfield will become a significant shareholder in Sterling, giving Chesterfield shareholders a stake both in the upside of the Adeline property and Sterling's 100% owned high grade, district scale, Sail Pond silver-polymetallic property located approximately 500km from Adeline.\nThe main elements of the agreement are as follows:\n1) Sterling will pay a total of CAD$800,000 (\u00a3490,000) in three separate payments: CAD$100,000 (\u00a362,250) with immediate effect, and CAD$300,000 (\u00a3183,750) following receipt of permission from the TSX-V authorities to complete the deal, and a final CAD$400,000 (\u00a3230,000) to be paid on or before 30 November 2024.\n2)\nSterling will issue a total of 9m shares to Chesterfield in two equal lots of 4.5m, the first following and subject to receipt of permission from the TSX-V authorities to complete the deal, and the second tranche to be issued on or before 30 November 2024.\nChesterfield's ability to sell its shares in Sterling will be restricted according to certain terms detailed in the agreement.\n3) The final CAD$400,000 and the second tranche of 4.5m shares are payable should Sterling decide to exercise its option to acquire the Adeline licences at any time prior to 30 November 2024.\nSterling Metals is a listed exploration company with with a market capitalization of CAD17.35m (\u00a310.65m), it is the holder of\nthe Sail Pond project a 135km2 set of licences in Newfoundland, eastern Canada. Discovered at the end of 2016, the Sail Pond project consists of a 12 km anomaly with strong surface showings of silver, copper, lead, antimony and zinc. Over the last two years Sterling has uncovered a 1km footprint at the south end of the anomaly which includes the 400m x 200m x 150m Heimdall zone as well as a new zone, 500m north of Heimdall where drilling intercepted a 100% sulfosalt vein grading 1,564g/t Ag, 8.33% Cu, 12.83% Pb, 2.74% Sb, and 3.93% Zn (A long section has been provided below in Figure 1). Sterling is currently running a deep Orion survey (\na structural and mineralised mapping tool that reaches down to 2km depth)\nto locate the source of this large footprint and plans to drill the property in 2023. Sterling has a cash position at present of CAD$3.5m (\u00a3183,750).\nFigure 1: Longitudinal section looking west showing drilling with silver equivalent mineralization on drillholes\nChesterfield Executive Chairman Paul Ensor said, \"During the competitive process that we undertook in September 2022 we got to know Sterling well due to their great interest in Adeline and we are delighted to have reached this agreement with them. Through this new relationship, Chesterfield will have a stake in what in effect becomes a regional play for potentially two highly prospective licence areas in eastern Canada, in both cases originally sourced from the same renowned group, Altius Minerals. We look forward to working in partnership with Sterling to deliver the best possible value from Adeline to our shareholders.\"\nSterling Metals CEO Mathew Wilson said, \"We are thrilled to partner with Chesterfield and begin work on the Adeline project. The synergy due to the Altius ownership, our advisor Dr. Neil O'Brien, and the close proximity to our Sail Pond asset makes this an ideal fit and we anticipate limited friction in beginning our exploration work. It is rare to find one, let alone two \"company making\" assets in a junior explorer.The exposure for investors to the significant potential for large scale critical metals projects in such a wonderful jurisdiction as Newfoundland and Labrador makes this partnership an immediate value add for both Sterling and Chesterfield shareholders. This will be an exciting year.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until the release of this announcement.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.chesterfieldresourcesplc.com\nor contact:\nChesterfield Resources plc\nPaul Ensor, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7595 219 011\nFirst Equity Limited\nJason Robertson\nTel: +44 20 7330 1883\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
