I am pleased to confirm that the transaction completed and JIML received the initial sale proceeds of \u00a39m on 8 July 2025 (\"\nCompletion\n\"). Two further deferred consideration payments are due of \u00a31m each, payable twelve and twenty four months after Completion subject to certain criteria as set out in the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025.\nThe Board of Jarvis Securities is committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind-down of JIML and it has now appointed S&W Partners LLP (S&W) to monitor this objective on its behalf. The Directors believe a professional independent firm with extensive experience in the wind down of regulated entities will be better placed to challenge and advise and will be in the best interests of clients and shareholders. JIML is continuing to deliver the wind-down and clear the remediation tasks, therefore costs remain significant at this time.\nJarvis Securities continues to receive interest income, though much reduced due to the reduction in client money held by JIML. So long as this continues together with other small revenue streams the Board will continue to review on a quarterly basis its ability to pay dividends. The Directors currently believe JIML has headroom to cover its cost until the final close down of operations, which will be reviewed and monitored as part of the recent engagement with S&W. JIML is currently restricted from paying up any dividend to JSP under the conditions of the Voluntary Agreed restrictions (VReQ) with the FCA (see announcement dated 16th September 2022).\nS&W have also been asked to review the remaining business assets of the Group and advise if there are any further sales which might generate value. As at 29th December 2025 the Group currently has cash of \u00a310.4m.\nAs set out in the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025, whilst the Directors continue to keep their strategic options under review it is still the intention of the Directors to seek cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 in due course (the \"\nProposed Cancellation\n\"). The Proposed Cancellation would be subject to,\ninter alia\n, shareholder approval, with the expectation that any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders.\nAs always, I would like to thank all off our staff for their hard work and support over what has been another challenging and stressful period.\nFCA Update\nThe Board of Jarvis also confirms today that as part of the wind down process and the ongoing engagement with the FCA, the board of its subsidiary company, JIML, has due to historic\u00a0breaches of FCA conduct of business rules\u00a0determined it has incurred an obligation to provide redress to certain clients. The first breach\u00a0is\u00a0in respect of\u00a0inducement rules, specifically\u00a0the\u00a0sharing of commission\u00a0with an introducer. The second\u00a0breach\u00a0is\u00a0with regards to unclear and potentially misleading language in legacy versions of the JIML client terms of business when describing the rate and circumstances in which interest would be paid on client money held.\nThe details of the redress scheme are yet to be finalised, and are subject to engagement with the FCA. In addition, the calculation of the likely cost of any redress is complex and the directors of JIML have been required to make assumptions about how any financial\nr\nedress payable to clients should be calculated, which clients should be included in the scope of the redress scheme and the percentage of clients that are expected to opt in to the redress scheme. However, JIML, having taken legal advice, currently estimates that this will incur a liability over the next 12 months in the region of \u00a32.8m. Although, if the assumptions given above transpire to be incorrect, this amount may be materially adjusted in the future. More details of this are set out in Note 25 (below)\nGeneral Meeting\nThe Company will today dispatch to shareholders its Annual Report and Accounts for the 18 months ended 30 June 2025, and a notice convening a General Meeting (\"GM\") of the Company, to approve the accounts to be held at Spa Hotel, Tunbridge Wells, TN4 8XJ on 29 January 2026 at 9am. The Annual Report and Accounts and Notice of GM will also be available from the Company's website,\nwww.jarvissecurities.co.uk\n.\nAndrew Grant\nChairman\nKieran Price, Finance Director of Jarvis Securities Plc, has approved this announcement and authorised its release.\nEnquiries\n:\nJarvis Securities plc enquiries@jarvissecurities.co.uk\nAndrew Grant\nZeus Capital 020 3829 5000\nKaty Mitchell\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nKey developments and outlook\nIn S\neptember 2022 the firm's regulated subsidiary Jarvis Investment Management Limited (\"JIML\") agreed to a voluntary restriction with the FCA of certain regulated activities, and the appointment of a skilled person to review their systems and controls.\nThroughout 2023, 2024 and 2025 to date JIML has continued to co-operate with the FCA and the skilled person by providing all information requested and to develop systems and controls as recommended by the skilled person. This has been a resource intensive process and taken a considerable amount of management's time as well as internal and external cost.\nOne outcome of this process has been the recruitment of a number of senior staff with the specialist skills required to take the business out of the voluntary restriction. This resulted in a significant, and permanent, increase to the cost base of the regulated entity. At the same time, the firm's number of model B clients continued to reduce, impacting trading volumes and therefore revenue prior to the decision to wind-down.\nThe external developments of the economy are widely known. Central bank policy of using interest rates in order to subdue price inflation continued though to August 2024, after which rates began to fall as inflationary pressures reduced. This has continued to be the case, reducing the revenue available from client money treasury deposits. Also, increased price competition from an increasing number of much larger firms who are able to take advantage of a number of economies of scale that are not available to Jarvis.\nThe above internal and external factors have been the key contributors to the firm's decision to sell the retail client book, give notice to all corporate clients, and wind-down the remaining business. This culminated in the announcement on 15th April 2025 of JIML entering into a conditional sale agreement disposing of its retail execution-only brokerage business to Interactive Investor Services Limited for a consideration of up to \u00a311,000,000 payable in cash. The sale completed on 7th July 2025 and the first amount payable of \u00a39,000,000 was received by JIML on 8th July 2025. Following the sale, JIML is currently in the process of winding down Subsequently, two items of redress have been identified within JIML, and financial provisions have been made as detailed within these financial statements.\nJarvis Securities Plc continues to review its strategic options, though once JIML's operations are wound down, the firm would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 the firm would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party.\nAt this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.\nPerformance\nResults and quarterly dividends (pence per share)\nThe consolidated profit for the period after income tax amounted to \u00a32,182,644 (Year to 31st December 2023: \u00a33,981,233). The company paid quarterly interim dividends per share totalling 6.75p during the period (Year to 31st December 2023: 8.75p). The company will review dividends on a quarterly basis. A special dividend of 2.9p was declared on 31st July 2025. No final dividend is proposed by the board.\nAnnual Dividend (pence per share)\n* In 2015 in addition to total quarterly dividends of 4.125p per share a 2.5p special dividend was also paid.\n** In 2019 in addition to total quarterly dividends of 6.56p per share a 3.75p special dividend was also paid\n*** In 2021 in addition to total quarterly dividends of 13.5p per share a 8.5p special dividend was also paid\nThe special dividends are excluded from the graph\nProfit before tax - \u00a3m\nThe reduction in profit before tax on an annualised basis has been caused by lower commission income as trading volumes have continued to decrease, combined with continued significant internal and external remediation costs relating to the voluntary requirement and skilled person. These are reported within Exceptional administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement, which also includes legal fees in relation to the sale of the retail business and provisions for redress totalling \u00a32,831,848. When adjusted, the PBT for the 18 months to 30th June 2025 of \u00a37.0m (being PBT \u00a33.0m plus Exceptional administrative costs \u00a34.0m) is lower on an annualised basis than the Year to 31st December 2023 equivalent of \u00a36.5m (being PBT \u00a35.2m plus Exceptional administrative expenses \u00a31.3m). These exceptional costs have been partially offset by increased average interest income over the period.\nTrade Volumes - average daily volume (1)\nTrade volumes have declined further during the 18 months to 30th June 2025, due to a combination of markets conditions and reduction in Model B clients.\nCash under administration - average balance (1)\nCash under administration is a function of client numbers and trade volumes. During the 18 months to 30th June 2025 cash under administration continued to decrease from prior periods, mainly due to the reduced volumes year-on-year.\n(1) These graphs are to demonstrate the trend and values have been intentionally omitted\nGroup structure\nThe principal trading subsidiary of the group is Jarvis Investment Management Ltd. Jarvis Investment Management Ltd is the 100% owner of three dormant nominee companies. For regulatory reasons relating to administration and cost, Jarvis Securities plc is the AIM traded parent, holds most of the assets of the group and is responsible for activities that fall outside the scope of regulated investment business. Jarvis Investment Management Ltd is a Member of The London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Aquis Stock Exchange (AQSE) and is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This status is essential for the trading activities of the group and therefore compliance with the rules of both the LSE and FCA is of paramount importance. The group provides retail execution-only stockbroking, ISA investment wrappers, and savings schemes. In addition, it provides financial administration, settlement and safe custody services in all these areas to other stockbrokers and investment firms as well as individuals.\nCapitalisation and financing\nJarvis Securities plc had 64,000,000 authorised Ordinary 0.25p shares. Of these, 44,731,000 were in issue at the end of the period. These shares are admitted to trading on AIM. The business requires no debt or external financing. The Board balance the use of cash between maintaining sufficient reserves for regulatory requirements, the stated dividend policy, and delivery the wind-down plan.\nEPS and P/E ratio\nThe principal measures used by investors to compare and rate publicly traded companies are the earnings per share (EPS) and the relative multiple to these earnings of the current share price (the price earnings or P/E ratio). The Board must have regard to these measures in order to maximise returns to investors. EPS is a result of dividing profit after tax by the average number of shares in issue throughout the period. The P/E ratio is the average share price during the year divided by EPS. The average share price during the period was 49p (Year to 31st December 2023: 123p). The P/E ratio is largely a product of the market price of the shares in the Company and hence is largely beyond the control of the Board. These measures are important to investors and hence need to be given high regard.\n18 months to 30th June 2025 EPS (annualised): 3.25p\nYear to 31st December 2023 EPS: 8.90p\nRate of change: -63.5%\n18 months to 30th June 2025 P/E ratio: 10.08\nYear to 31st December 2023 P/E ratio: 13.85\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nThe following are the main risks to the Jarvis Securities plc group that are considered and monitored by the board:\nRevenue risk\nThe Jarvis business model has several income streams. These are primarily commission income, interest income and fixed fee income. As described earlier in this report, each of these areas has been subject to various external pressures, resulting in the decision to sell the retail execution-only brokerage business.\nRegulatory risk\nChanges in the regulatory environment resulting in additional costs or significant system or product amendments.\nThe firm operates in the \"execution only\", transaction processing and reporting, and safe custody areas of the financial services environment. Retail clients are currently only able to sell or hold assets. As part of ongoing risk management, the firm avoids entry into areas where it lacks expertise or that have additional regulatory complexities. The firm is currently undergoing a skilled person review and is using outside expertise as required to ensure the correct risk framework is established and the firm is fully compliant with its Consumer Duty obligations during the wind-down period.\nCompetitor risk\nThe firm operates in a competitive industry and has many larger competitors in the execution only retail and institutional market.\nCybercrime\nLoss of data, client assets or corporate assets through breaches of our IT infrastructure would result in financial loss to the firm and reputational damage.\nThe board acknowledge the growing threat of cybercrime and maintain up to date industry standards in IT security. The firm's IT infrastructure is externally audited, policies and procedures are in place to minimise the risk of critical data loss, employees must complete ongoing training in money laundering and fraud prevention and all computers are installed with malware protection.\nInterest rate risk\nThe interest rate environment has a significant effect on the earnings of the company. This risk is reducing as Jarvis Investment Management Limited's wind down progresses and the amount of client money deposits falls.\nEconomic risk\nMarket sentiment directly impacts on bargain numbers transacted and hence commission income for the company, however this is no longer significant as Jarvis Investment Management Limited is in wind-down and has recently moved to a hold/sell only product for remaining retail clients.\nReputational risk\nAs the custodian of the wealth of our clients, the firm adopts procedures that minimise the risk of fraudulent activity occurring either within the firm or by a third party.\nOperational risk\nThe main risk Jarvis is exposed to in its day to day activities is settlement risk, and all procedures within the firm are designed to mitigate this risk where possible. There may be instances where errors occur which leave the firm unintentionally exposed to market risk as a result of an error in its operating processes. Given the volume of transactions being processed these errors are extremely infrequent. When they do occur, they are reviewed to see if further process enhancements can be made to minimise future errors.\nKey personnel risk\nLoss of key personnel is a threat to any skills-based business.\nThe firm attempts to set remuneration at competitive market levels and empower key employees so that they enjoy working at Jarvis. All employment contracts for key staff members include sufficient notice periods for replacements to be recruited and trained. Jarvis Investment Management Limited has designed and implemented a staff retention schedule, together with a financial package, to ensure that staff with the appropriate skills remain with the firm until the appropriate point within the wind down of the company. The firm has also introduced initiatives such as hybrid working for specific roles, flexibles hours etc. in order to attract and retain high calibre staff, which it acknowledges as a challenge especially given the firms outside London location.\nThird party reliance risk\nAny take over at the London Stock Exchange could result in major unanticipated changes for Jarvis and its commercial clients.\nThe board monitor any proposed changes to the pricing structure of The London Stock Exchange and will calculate any impact on the wind down of Jarvis Investment Management Limited.\nRegulatory capital\nJarvis Investment Management Limited, the Group's main operating subsidiary, is a class 2 non-small and not interconnected firm (non SNI firm), authorised and regulated by the FCA, and together with its' parent, Jarvis Securities Plc, forms a UK Investment Firm Group. At 30th June 2025 Jarvis Investment Management Limited had regulatory capital resources of \u00a30.7m and an Own Funds Threshold Requirement of \u00a37.1m, giving a capital solvency ratio of 11% as at that time, the company was awaiting the completion of the sale of the execution-only retail brokerage business, which returns the capital solvency ratio to 204% as at 31st July 2025.\nJarvis Investment Management Limited maintains an Internal Capital and Risk Assessment (ICARA), which includes reviewing the risks the firm is exposed to and performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity required by Jarvis Investment Management Limited. Consolidated regulatory capital forecasts are performed quarterly prior to the payment of any dividend from Jarvis Securities Plc. Jarvis Investment Management Limited's MIFIDPRU 8 disclosures are published annually on the company's website and provide further details about the Company's regulatory capital resources and requirements.\nSection 172(1) Statement\nThe directors act in good faith to make decisions, the outcome of which, they consider will be most likely to promote the success of the group for the benefit of its members as a whole both in current periods and in the long term.\nIn discharging their duties above, the directors carefully consider amongst other matters, the impact on and interests of other stakeholders in the group and factor these into their decision-making process.\nEmployees\nDirectors receive information on various staff metrics. The directors are committed to promoting a healthy workforce comprising both physical and mental wellbeing. The directors keep staff informed of key issues through structured communication channels, promote inclusion in the workplace and also provide training and development opportunities which are considered of benefit to the group and employees. Using the Group's recruitment and development strategies, the directors seek to attract and retain talented staff. A staff retention policy has been implemented to ensure staff are incentivised to remain with the firm for the required length of time in order to support the wind-down.\nCustomers\nThe directors commit considerable time, effort and resources into understanding and responding to the needs of our customers at all times. We act to service our customer's needs to the highest standards and have procedures in place for the escalation of disputes on the infrequent occasions they occur.\nSuppliers\nThe Group seeks to pay all suppliers any undisputed amounts due and that conform with the Group's billing requirements within agreed terms.\nCommunity and the environment\nThe Group takes its role within the community seriously and promotes and encourages community and charitable contribution. The Group also recognises the importance of environmental responsibilities and whilst not in an industry that has a significant impact on the environment, it participates in schemes such as cycle to work to promote environmental awareness.\nStandards and conduct\nThe group has a series of defined codes of practice regarding ethical standards and the conduct of business. These are clearly communicated to every staff member and adherence to which is expected and enforced.\nConsolidated income statement for the 18 MONTHS ended 30 JUNE 2025\n18 Months to\nYear

Basis of preparation\nThe Company has adopted the requirements of international accounting standards as adopted by the United Kingdom and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below, which have been consistently applied to all the periods presented. Due to the timing of the completion of the sale by JIML of its retail execution-only business, the Board decided to extend the accounting period from December 2024 to June 2025 in order to ensure the sale had completed prior to the preparation of the accounts, which it did on 7th July 2025. Because of this change, the amounts presented in the financial statements are not entirely comparable.\nDue to the group no longer being a going concern (see below), all assets and liabilities have been reclassified as current. Assets are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell on a fair value basis, with no material write-ups or write downs.\nNew standards, not yet effective\nThere are no standards that are issued but not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\nSignificant judgements and estimates\nThe group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. These estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. These judgements and estimates include impairment of investments, per note 11, and provisions and contingent liabilities, per note 25.\nGoing concern\nThe group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report (above). The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described within these financial statements. In addition, note 24 of the financial statements includes the group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.\nThe group has considerable financial resources, however, as described in the Strategic Report (above) , the firm is currently in wind-down and therefore the Board do not consider the going concern basis appropriate for these financial statements. This differs to the previous financial period reported, which were prepared on a going concern basis as, at that time, the firm intended to continue trading with the aim of increasing profitability.\n2. Accounting policies\n(a) IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'\nCommission - the group charges commission on a transaction basis. Commission rates are fixed according to account type. When a client instructs us to act as an agent on their behalf (for the purchase or sale of securities) our commission is recognised as income on a point in time basis when the instruction is executed in the market. Our commission is deducted from the cash given to us by the client in order to settle the transaction on the client's behalf or from the proceeds of the sale in instance where a client sells securities.\nManagement fees - these are charged quarterly or bi-annually depending on account type. Fees are either fixed or are a percentage of the assets under administration. Management fees income is recognised over time as they are charged using a day count and most recent asset level basis as appropriate.\nInterest income - this is accrued on a day count basis up until deposits mature and the interest income is received. The deposits pay a fixed rate of interest. In accordance with FCA requirements, deposits are only placed with banks that have been approved by our Treasury Committee. Interest income is recognised over time as the deposits accrue interest on a daily basis.\n(b) Basis of consolidation\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases. The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Jarvis Securities plc, Jarvis Investment Management Limited, JIM Nominees Limited, Galleon Nominees Limited and Dudley Road Nominees Limited made up to 30 June 2025.\nThe Group uses the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,\nirrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group's share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.\nIntra-group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation and all sales and profit figures relate to external transactions only. No profit and loss account is presented for Jarvis Securities plc as provided by S408 of the Companies Act 2006.\n(c) Property, plant and equipment\nAll property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the lives of the assets at the following rates:\nLeasehold improvements - 33% on cost, or over the lease period if less than 3 years\nOffice equipment - 20% on cost\nLand & Buildings - Buildings are depreciated at 2% on cost. Land is not depreciated.\nRight of use asset - Straight line basis over the lease period\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each year end date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the income statement. Impairment reviews of property, plant and equipment are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that the recoverable amounts may be less than the asset's carrying value.\n(d) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. If acquired as part of a business combination the initial cost of the intangible asset is the fair value at the acquisition date. Amortisation is charged to administrative expenses within the income statement and provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the lives of the assets at the following rates:\nDatabases - 4% on cost\nCustomer relationships - 7% on cost\nSoftware developments - 20% on cost\nWebsite - 33% on cost\nImpairment reviews of intangible assets are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that the recoverable amounts may be less than the asset's carrying value.\n(e) Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the aggregate fair values of the net identifiable assets of the acquired trade and assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any negative goodwill arising is credited to the income statement in full immediately.\n(f) Deferred income tax\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n(g) Segmental reporting\nA business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. The directors regard the operations of the Group as a single segment.\n(h) Pensions\nThe group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable for the year are charged to the income statement.\n(i) Investments\nInvestments held for trading\nUnder IFRS investments held for trading are recognised as financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss.\nInvestments in subsidiaries\nInvestments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.\n(j) Share capital\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from proceeds, net of income tax. Where the company purchases its equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the company's equity holders.\n(k) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise:\nBalance at bank and in hand - cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nCash held for settlement of market transactions - this balance is cash generated through settlement activity, and can either be a surplus or a deficit. A surplus arises when settlement liabilities exceed settlement receivables. This surplus is temporary and is accounted for separately from the balance at bank and in hand as it is short term and will be required to meet settlement liabilities as they fall due. A deficit arises when settlement receivables exceed settlement liabilities. In this instance Jarvis will place its own funds in the client account to ensure CASS obligations are met. This deficit is also temporary and will reverse once settlement receivables are settled.\n(l) Current income tax\nCurrent income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the Period end date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which they relate based on the taxable profit for the period.\n(m) Dividend distribution\nDividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group's financial statements in the period in which interim dividends are notified to shareholders and final dividends are approved by the company's shareholders.\n(n) IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are recognised in the Company's statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nFinancial assets are classified into specified categorises. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and id determined at the time of recognition.\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, other than those classified as fair value through the income statement, which are measured at fair value.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is considered to be remote.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nFinancial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\nFinancial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement or other financial liabilities.\nFinancial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.\n(o) IFRS 16 'Leases'\nThe lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implied in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate.\nThe Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for contracts with options to renew or exit early.\nThe carrying amount of right-of-use assets recognised was \u00a3384,985 at the lease start date of 27 September 2022. A finance charge of 5% APR is used to calculate the finance cost of the lease. The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low value assets and short-term leases. Lease payments relating to these leases are expensed to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(p) IFRS 15 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations'.\nThe firm has implemented IFRS 5 for the accounting period ended 30th June 2025 as the Board do not consider the going concern basis of preparation to be appropriate due to the Board's decision to wind-down the business. Therefore, all revenue is considered to be derived from discontinued Operations, Fixed Assets have been reclassified as Non-current Assets Held for Sale, and all non-current liabilities have been reclassified as current.\n(q) Provisions\nThe group has recognised provisions for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount including those for onerous leases, warranty claims, leasehold dilapidations and legal disputes. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the liability.\n3. Group revenue\nThe revenue of the group during the year was wholly in the United Kingdom and the revenue of the group for the year derives from the same class of business as noted in the Strategic Report.\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st Dec 2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nGross interest earned from treasury deposits, cash at bank and overdrawn client accounts\n12,063,459\n7,614,815\nCommissions\n3,177,939\n2,660,896\nFees\n2,609,064\n2,813,196\n17,850,462\n13,088,907\n4. Segmental information\nAll of the reported revenue and operational results for the period derive from the group's external customers and continuing financial services operations. All non-current assets are held within the United Kingdom. The group is not reliant on any one customer and no customer accounts for more than 10% of the group's external revenues.\nAs noted in 2 (g) the directors regard the operations of the group as a single reporting segment on the basis there is only a single organisational unit that is reported to key management personnel for the purpose of performance assessment and future resource allocation.\n5.\nProfit before income tax\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st December 2023\nProfit before income tax is stated after charging/(crediting):\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nDirectors' emoluments\n1,229,864\n729,827\nDepreciation - right of use asset\n115,496\n76,997\nDepreciation - owned assets\n14,433\n15,863\nAmortisation (included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement)\n31,940\n25,561\nLow value leases\n13,794\n8,852\nImpairment of receivable charge / (credit)\n(83,431)\n(8,598)\nBank transaction fees\n102,310\n51,362\nDetails of directors' annual remuneration are set out below:\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st December 2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nShort-term employee benefits\n1,059,089\n641,243\nPost-employment benefits\n158,959\n74,393\nBenefits in kind\n11,816\n14,191\n1,229,864\n729,827\nDetails of the highest paid director are as follows:\nAggregate emoluments\n386,500\n357,500\nPost-employment benefits\n101,709\n-\nBenefits in kind\n9,919\n11,133\n498,128\n368,633\nEmoluments & Benefits in kind\nPension\nTotal\nDirectors\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAndrew J Grant\n396,419\n101,709\n498,128\nKieran M Price\n205,353\n19,750\n225,103\nS M Middleton\n55,000\n-\n55,000\nJarvis Investment Management Directors\n339,133\n30,000\n369,133\nTOTAL\n995,905\n151,459\n1,147,364\nDuring the period benefits accrued for four directors (Year to 31st December 2023: four directors) under a money purchase pension scheme.\n5.

These systems and the registration contributed significantly to turning the group into a low cost effective provider of execution only stockbroking solutions. The key assumptions used by the directors in their annual impairment review are that the company can benefit indefinitely from the reduced dealing costs and the company's current operational capacity remains unchanged. The recoverable amount of the goodwill has been assessed at fair value less costs to sell. There are no reasonable changes in assumptions that would cause the cash generating unit value to fall below its carrying amount.\nFollowing the sale of the retail execution-only business, the firm is reviewing the recoverable amount of the goodwill, and other intangible assets.\n11.

Leases\nLease liabilities are secured by the related underlying assets.\nDue to Jarvis Investment Management limited being in wind-down, non-current lease liabilities have been reclassified as current liabilities.\nThe undiscounted maturity analysis of lease liabilities as at 30 June 2025 is as follows:\n< 1 year (\u00a3)\nLease payment\n196,875\nFinance charge\n(11,518)\nNet present value\n185,114\n30th June 2025\nLease liabilities included in the current statement of financial position\n\u00a3\nCurrent\n185,114\nNon-current\n-\n185,114\n30th June 2025\n\u00a3\nAmounts recognised in income statement\n18,852\n18,852\nThe company had a lease with Sion Properties Limited, a company controlled by A J Grant, for the rental of 78 Mount Ephraim, a self-contained office building, which was assigned to the company's subsidiary Jarvis Investment Management Limited on 23rd May 2024. The lease has an annual rental of \u00a387,500, being the market rate on an arm's length basis, and expires on 26 September 2027.\nThe total cash outflow for leases in the 18 months to 30th June 2025 was \u00a3131,250 (Year to 31st December 2023 - \u00a387,500).\nJarvis Investment Management Limited is currently assessing its options in relation to the lease of 78 Mount Ephraim as it is expected that the wind-down will be complete before the lease expires in September 2027.\n14.

The group also has segregated deposits and current accounts on behalf of model B customers of \u00a3949,348 (31st December 2023 : \u00a3376,394) not governed by client money rules therefore they are also not included in the statement of financial position of the group. This treatment is appropriate as, although the business is not a going concern, no administrator is due to be appointed. However, were an administrator be appointed, these balances would be considered assets of the business.\n16.

Financial Instruments\nThe group's principal financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as trade receivables, trade payables etc. that arise directly from operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is the funding of the group's trading activities. Cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables are categorised as held at amortised cost, and trade and other payables and provisions are classified as held at amortised cost. Other than investments held for trading all financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost and their carrying value approximates to their fair value.\nThe main financial asset of the group is cash and cash equivalents which is denominated in Sterling and which is detailed in note 15. The group operates a low risk investment policy and surplus funds are placed on deposit with at least A rated banks or equivalent at floating interest rates.\nThe group also holds investments in equities and property.\n20. Immediate and ultimate parent undertaking\nThere is no immediate or ultimate controlling party.\n21. Related party transactions\nThe company had a lease with Sion Properties Limited, a company controlled by a director of the company, for the rental of 78 Mount Ephraim, a self-contained office building, which was assigned to the company's subsidiary Jarvis Investment Management Limited on 23rd May 2024. The lease has an annual rental of \u00a387,500. Full details of this lease are disclosed in Note 13.\nDuring the period Jarvis Investment Management Limited paid Jarvis Securities Plc \u00a327,000 (Year to 31st December 2023: \u00a318,000) for rental of a disaster recovery site.\nDuring the year Jarvis Securities Plc paid \u00a31,995,967 (2023: \u00a3352,522) in respect of relief for tax losses incurred by Jarvis Investment Management Ltd\nJarvis Investment Management Limited was owed \u00a3739,232 by Jarvis Securities Plc as at 30th June 2025 (31st December 2023: \u00a3482,067).\nDuring the period, directors, key staff and other related parties by virtue of control carried out share dealing transactions in the normal course of business. Commissions for such transactions are charged at various discounted rates. The impact of these transactions does not materially or significantly affect the financial position or performance of the company. At 30 June 2025, these same related parties had cash balances of \u00a3Nil (31st December 2023: \u00a344,738). No interest was earned during the period (Year to 31st December 2023: \u00a30). In addition to cash balances other equity assets of \u00a3574,769 (31st December 2023: \u00a34,151,917) were held by JIM Nominees Ltd as custodian.\nDuring the period Jarvis Securities Plc received \u00a311,759,467 (Year to 31st December 20233: \u00a37,365,165) in respect of interest earned on client balances held by Jarvis Investment Management Limited, in exchange for use of intellectual properties owned by Jarvis Securities Plc.\nAt the period end Directors directly held 18,266,486 shares in the company (31st December 2023: 11,125,620). A further 5,356,454 shares (31st December 2023: 12,546,620) shares were held by concert parties of the directors as defined by the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.\n22. Capital commitments\nAs of 30th June 2025, the company had no capital commitments (31st December 2023: nil).\n23. Fair value estimation\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price. The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.\n24. Financial risk management objectives and policies\nThe directors consider that their main risk management objective is to monitor and mitigate the key risks to the group, which are considered to be principally credit risk, compliance risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Several high-level procedures are in place to enable all risks to be better controlled. These include detailed profit forecasts, cash flow forecasts, monthly management accounts and comparisons against forecast, regular meetings of the full board of directors, and more regular senior management meetings.\nThe group's main credit risk is exposure to the trading accounts of clients. This credit risk is controlled via the use of credit algorithms within the computer systems of the subsidiary. These credit limits prevent the processing of trades in excess of the available maximum permitted margin at 100% of the current portfolio value of a client.\nA further credit risk exists in respect of trade receivables. The group's policy is to monitor trade and other receivables and avoid significant concentrations of credit risk. Aged receivables reports are reviewed regularly and significant items brought to the attention of senior management.\nThe compliance risk of the group is controlled through the use of robust policies, procedures, the segregation of tasks, internal reviews and systems controls. These processes are based upon the Rules and guidance notes of the Financial Conduct Authority and the London Stock Exchange and are overseen by the compliance officer together with the management team. In addition, regular compliance performance information is prepared, reviewed and distributed to management.\nThe group does not make use of bank loans or overdraft facilities. Financial risk is therefore mitigated by the maintenance of positive cash balances and by the regular review of the banks used by the group. Liquidity is monitored on an intra-day basis, and management received daily reports showing both fund availability and bank diversification for client money. The liquidity of corporate funds is managed by the Finance department, and both client and corporate liquidity form part of the remit of the Treasury committee, which sits monthly within JIML. Other risks, including operational, reputational and legal risks are under constant review at senior management level by the executive directors and senior managers at their regular meetings, and by the full board at their regular meetings.\nThe group derives a significant proportion of its revenue from interest earned on client cash deposits and does not have any borrowings. Hence, the directors do not consider the group to be materially exposed to interest rate risk in terms of the usual consideration of financing costs, but do note that there is a risk to earnings. This risk is considered no longer relevant as the group is no longer a going concern.\nThe capital structure of the group consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings. Jarvis Investment Management Limited has an Internal Capital and Risk Assessment process (\"ICARA\"), as required by the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") for establishing the amount of regulatory capital to be held by that company. The ICARA gives consideration to both current and projected financial and capital positions. The ICARA is updated throughout the year to take account of any significant changes to business plans and any unexpected issues that may occur. The ICARA is discussed and approved at a board meeting of the subsidiary at least annually. Capital adequacy is monitored regularly by management. Jarvis Investment Management Limited uses the simplified approach to Credit Risk and the standardised approach for Operational Risk to calculate Pillar 1 requirements. Jarvis Investment Management Limited observed the FCA's regulatory requirements throughout the period. Information disclosure under MIFIDPRU 8 is available from the group's websites. Further information regarding regulatory capital is disclosed in the strategic report.\nThe group offers settlement of trades in sterling as well as various foreign currencies. The group does not hold any material assets or liabilities other than in sterling and converts client currency on matching terms to settlement of trades realising any currency gain or loss immediately in the income statement. Consequently, the group has no foreign exchange risk.\nAs of 30 June 2025, trade receivables of \u00a3110,771 (31st December 2023: \u00a3275,691) were past due and were impaired and partially provided for. The amount of the provision was \u00a335,114 as at 30 June 2025 (31st December 2023: \u00a335,506). The individually impaired receivables relate to clients who are in a loan position and who do not have adequate stock to cover these positions. The amount of the impairment is determined by clients' perceived willingness and ability to pay the debt, legal judgements obtained in respect of, charges secured on properties and payment plans in place and being adhered to. Where debts are determined to be irrecoverable, they are written off through the income and expenditure account. The group is in the process of collecting outstanding amounts as part of the wind-down process.\nGroup\nCompany\nProvision of impairment of receivables:\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st December 2023\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st December 2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAt 1 January\n35,506\n57,828\n-\n-\nCharge / (credit) for the period\n83,039\n(13,724)\n-\n-\nUncollectable amounts written off\n(83,431)\n(8,598)\n-\n-\nAt end of period\n35,114\n35,506\n-\n-\n25. Provisions and Contingent Liabilities\nThe group, like other financial organisations, is subject to legal proceedings, complaints and regulatory reviews in the normal course of its business. All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability. Where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a material outflow will be made a provision is established based on management's best estimate of the amount that will be payable. The company's subsidiary is subject to an ongoing voluntary restriction in accordance with section 55L of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"). In addition, the company receives complaints and claims in relations to its services from time to time brought by clients, investors, regulators or other third parties. These types of enquiries can sometimes be prolonged due to their inherent complexity.\nGroup\nCompany\nProvision in respect of redress:\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st December 2023\n18 months to 30th June 2025\nYear to 31st December 2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nOpening balance\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCharge / (credit) for the period - Inducement\n439,365\n-\n-\n-\nCharge / (credit) for the period - Interest\n2,392,483\n-\n-\n-\nAt end of period\n2,831,848\n-\n-\n-\nInducement\nThe company has incurred an obligation to provide redress in respect of a historic breach of inducement rules. The Board of JIML have agreed to provide redress to the clients impacted by this breach, and the amount provided represents the directors' best estimate of the liability having taken legal advice. The expected outflow for which is expected to occur within two years.\nInterest\nThe board of directors, having taken legal advice on this issue, have agreed to provide for redress related to interest due to customers who previously held client money with the group. The calculation of the provision is complex and the directors have made assumptions about how any financial redress payable to customers should be calculated, which customers should be included in the scope of the redress scheme and the percentage of customers that are expected to opt in to the redress scheme. Additionally, the directors have not yet finalised all of the terms of the redress scheme, which is also subject to engagement with the FCA,\nThe expected outflow for this claim is expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date.\nWe have considered the nature of these estimates and concluded that it is possible, on the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year may be different to assumptions we have applied as at 30th June 2025. These outcomes may require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of liabilities in the next financial year. Our provisions largely represent expected future costs related to legal proceedings and customer redress including consequential loss. The assumptions used in these estimates are highly sensitive, a 25% increase in these provisions would result in a \u00a3707,962 charge to the income statement and a 0,5% increase in the interest rate used to calculate the financial redress payable to customers would result in an increase in the provision and the charge to the income statement of \u00a31,489,162.\n26. Subsequent Events\nThe completion of the sale of the retail execution-only business was announced on 7th July 2025. Also, on 31st July 2025, a special dividend of 2.90 pence per share was declared, and paid on 3rd September 2025. The directors consider there are no other subsequent events.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Indicate in the relevant section whether the issuer is a non UK issuer.\niii\nOther reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.\niv\nThis should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h); (c) all parties to the agreement referred to in DTR5.2.1 (a) or (d) the holder of financial instruments referred to in DTR5.3.1.\nAs the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.\nIn relation to the transactions referred to in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h), the following list is provided as indication of the persons who should be mentioned:\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (b), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring temporarily for consideration the voting rights;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (c), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (d), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural person or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (e), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification duty at an individual level under DTR 5.1, under DTR5.2.1 (a) to (d) or under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (f), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (g), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (h), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights at his discretion (e.g. management companies).\nv\nApplicable in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity referred to DTR5.2 unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with national practices (e.g. identification of funds managed by management companies).\nvi\nThe date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took effect.\nvii\nThe total number of voting rights held in the issuer shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.\nviii\nIf the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold, please note that it might not be necessary to disclose the extent of the holding, only that the new holding is below that threshold.\nix\nIn case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached \"direct holding\" and voting rights \"indirect holding\", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.\nx\nDate of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.\nxi\nIf the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months starting from [date].\nxii\nIn case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-adjusted basis (DTR 5.3.3.A).\nxiii\nIf the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then the second option applies.\nxiv\nThe full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity has to be presented also in the cases, in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification as only in this way will the markets get always the full picture of the group holdings. In case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains have to be presented chain by chain by numbering each chain accordingly. Please see the below example:\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain 1)\nName of controlled undertaking B\nName of controlled undertaking C\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain 2)\nName of controlled undertaking B\nName of controlled undertaking D\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain3)\nName of controlled undertaking E\nName of controlled undertaking F\nxv\nThe names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held have to be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.\nxvi\nExample: Correction of a previous notification.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

I am pleased to confirm that the transaction completed and JIML received the initial sale proceeds of \u00a39m on 8 July 2025 (\"\nCompletion\n\"). Two further deferred consideration payments are due of \u00a31m each, payable twelve and twenty four months after Completion subject to certain criteria as set out in the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025.\nThe Board of Jarvis Securities is committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind-down of JIML and it has now appointed S&W Partners LLP (S&W) to monitor this objective on its behalf. The Directors believe a professional independent firm with extensive experience in the wind down of regulated entities will be better placed to challenge and advise and will be in the best interests of clients and shareholders. JIML is continuing to deliver the wind-down and clear the remediation tasks, therefore costs remain significant at this time.\nJarvis Securities continues to receive interest income, though much reduced due to the reduction in client money held by JIML. So long as this continues together with other small revenue streams the Board will continue to review on a quarterly basis its ability to pay dividends. The Directors currently believe JIML has headroom to cover its cost until the final close down of operations, which will be reviewed and monitored as part of the recent engagement with S&W. JIML is currently restricted from paying up any dividend to JSP under the conditions of the Voluntary Agreed restrictions (VReQ) with the FCA (see announcement dated 16th September 2022).\nS&W have also been asked to review the remaining business assets of the Group and advise if there are any further sales which might generate value. As at 29th December 2025 the Group currently has cash of \u00a310.4m.\nAs set out in the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025, whilst the Directors continue to keep their strategic options under review it is still the intention of the Directors to seek cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 in due course (the \"\nProposed Cancellation\n\"). The Proposed Cancellation would be subject to,\ninter alia\n, shareholder approval, with the expectation that any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders.\nAs always, I would like to thank all off our staff for their hard work and support over what has been another challenging and stressful period.\nFCA Update\nThe Board of Jarvis also confirms today that as part of the wind down process and the ongoing engagement with the FCA, the board of its subsidiary company, JIML, has due to historic\u00a0breaches of FCA conduct of business rules\u00a0determined it has incurred an obligation to provide redress to certain clients. The first breach\u00a0is\u00a0in respect of\u00a0inducement rules, specifically\u00a0the\u00a0sharing of commission\u00a0with an introducer. The second\u00a0breach\u00a0is\u00a0with regards to unclear and potentially misleading language in legacy versions of the JIML client terms of business when describing the rate and circumstances in which interest would be paid on client money held.\nThe details of the redress scheme are yet to be finalised, and are subject to engagement with the FCA. In addition, the calculation of the likely cost of any redress is complex and the directors of JIML have been required to make assumptions about how any financial\nr\nedress payable to clients should be calculated, which clients should be included in the scope of the redress scheme and the percentage of clients that are expected to opt in to the redress scheme. However, JIML, having taken legal advice, currently estimates that this will incur a liability over the next 12 months in the region of \u00a32.8m. Although, if the assumptions given above transpire to be incorrect, this amount may be materially adjusted in the future. More details of this are set out in Note 25 (below)\nGeneral Meeting\nThe Company will today dispatch to shareholders its Annual Report and Accounts for the 18 months ended 30 June 2025, and a notice convening a General Meeting (",

Due to the current position of the company, as described further below, a dividend re-investment plan is no longer being made available.\nCompany Update\nFurther to the announcement of 7 July 2025, the Company confirms that following the sale of its retail execution only brokerage by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Jarvis Investment Management Limited (\"JIML\"), the Group continues the process of terminating the Model B clearing and settlement services businesses within JIML and winding its other operations down. JIML also continues to progress with the remediation work recommended by the Skilled Person following their reviews. In line with JIML's regulatory obligations, the remediation when completed must be reviewed by the Skilled Person ahead of any final wind down. JIML's wind down plan is presently targeting a July 2026 completion.

It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date\u00a0that\u00a0all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party.\nAt this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the\n\"Proposed Cancellation\"\n) in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders.

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nJarvis Securities\n(\"Jarvis\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nSecond Interim Results\nfor the Six Months Ended 31 December 2024\nChairman's statement\n\u00b7\n\u00a3484,200 (8.4%) increase in revenue versus six months to 31 December 2023\n\u00b7\n\u00a3992,725 (71.1%) increase in profit before tax versus six months to 31 December 2023\n\u00b7\nEPS increased to 4.01p (six months to 31 December 2023: 2.38p)\nFollowing the change to the accounting reference date of the Company to 30 June, Jarvis announces its unaudited second interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2024.\nThe ramifications of the s.166 Skilled Person review and costs of remediation, combined with market transaction volumes that continue to remain subdued, are again reflected in the financial performance for the period under review. At the same time, interest rates that had previously remained relatively constant, began falling in the six months to 31 December 2024 (\"H2 2024\"). However, the Group continued to benefit from the favourable rates available versus the 6 months to 31st December 2023 (\"H2 2023\"), reflected in a 19% increase in interest income. Also, the intensive external remediation costs borne in H2 2023 were not mirrored in H2 2024, contributing to an overall increase in profit before tax of 71.1%.\nAlthough focus was placed on achieving successful completion of the sale of the retail execution-only brokerage in the period, the Company's subsidiary, Jarvis Investment Management Limited (\"JIML\") continued to work through the skilled person recommendations as required by the FCA and continues to be committed to achieving a point where the voluntary agreed restrictions (the \"VREQ\") on JIML, as announced on 16th\u00a0September 2022, can be lifted.\nCurrent Trading\nSince the end of the period under review, and as announced on 15th April 2025, JIML has conditionally agreed to sell the majority of its retail execution-only brokerage business, with completion provisionally due to occur in early July 2025 (the \"Transaction\"). As announced earlier today, the Directors are aware of certain conditions that enables the buyer, Interactive Investor Services Limited (\"ii\"), to withdraw from the Transaction, unless waived. Although ii have indicated that they still intend to progress to completion and both parties continue to work towards the successful completion of the Transaction. If completion of the Transaction does not occur this will have a detrimental financial impact on the Group. If the Transaction does complete, the Group will mainly comprise the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete.\nOverall subdued trading volumes continue as JIML implements its' wind down and prepares for completion of the Transaction. In addition, as announced on 15th April 2025, the Group has agreed not to take on any new clients going forward. Model B clients have been served notice and the Group is working with each of them to ensure a smooth exit. Remediation work continues and focus is placed on ensuring sufficient resources remain in place to achieve this.\nOutlook\nThe Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months.\nAs announced on 15 April 2025, if the Transaction completes and if the Model B Arrangements are terminated, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. If the Transaction completes and if the Model B Arrangements are terminated, it is anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date\u00a0that\u00a0all, or substantially all of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party.\nAt this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the\n\"Proposed Cancellation\"\n) in due course, with the expectation that any ",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 April 2025\nJarvis Securities plc\n(\"Jarvis\" or the \"Company\" and with its subsidiaries the \"Group\")\nConditional Sale of Execution-Only Brokerage Business\nStrategic Direction Update\nJarvis Securities plc (AIM: JIM) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Jarvis Investment Management Limited (\"\nJIML\n\"), has today executed a conditional sale agreement disposing of its retail execution-only brokerage business to Interactive Investor Services Limited (\"\nInteractive Investor\n\") for a consideration of up to \u00a311,000,000 payable in cash (\"\nConsideration\n\") (the \"\nTransaction\n\") (the \"\nAgreement\n\").\nThe Transaction will exclude a small number of out-of-scope customers, who JIML will contact shortly to assist with the transfer to a provider of their choice.\nIt is anticipated that, subject to the conditions set out below, completion of the Transaction will occur by early-July 2025.\nFollowing execution of the Agreement, the Directors of the Company are now considering the strategic direction for the Group. After completion of the Transaction, the Group will only comprise the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service arrangements (\"\nModel B Arrangements\n\") within JIML. Accordingly, the Group is beginning the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete.\nAs a consequence of the execution of the Agreement, JIML has agreed with the FCA that it will not take on any new clients going forward.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nSale of the majority of JIML's retail execution only brokerage business\n\u00b7\nTotal consideration of up to \u00a311m\n\u00b7\nModel B clearing and settlement services to be wound up.\nAndrew Grant, Managing Director of Jarvis commented:\n\"\nWe believe this transaction represents the best outcome for the Group and its clients given the position of Jarvis Investment Management at this time and its future viability\"\nDetails of the Transaction\nAs set out above, JIML has conditionally agreed to the sale of its retail business to Interactive Investor for a potential consideration of \u00a311,000,000. Within this part of its business, JIML acts as an execution-only broker for retail clients in the United Kingdom through a range of dealing accounts such as the \"X-O\" and \"Sharedeal Active\" brands (the \"\nExecution Only Business\n\"). The Assets Under Administration (\"\nAUA\n\") for the Execution Only Business as at 14 April 2025 was approximately \u00a31.265bn (unaudited).\nThe consideration due under the Agreement is payable in three tranches: (i) \u00a39,000,000 is to be paid to JIML on Completion (as defined below); (ii) \u00a31,000,000 is to be paid to JIML approximately 12 months following Completion; and (iii) \u00a31,000,000 is to be paid to JIML approximately 18 months following Completion. Interactive Investor is entitled to withhold amounts from each tranche of deferred consideration in order to help satisfy any warranty or indemnity claims which are notified under the Agreement. Any amount which has been withheld but is agreed or determined as being due to JIML shall be paid to JIML following such agreement or determination.\nCompletion of the Transaction will occur, subject to certain conditions, when the last relevant client agreement of the Execution Only Business is transferred from JIML to Interactive Investor (\"\nCompletion\"\n). It is currently anticipated that Completion will occur by early-July 2025. In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. If Interactive Investor terminates the Agreement the Transaction will not proceed and no consideration is payable to JIML. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that the Transaction will complete although the Directors have every expectation that it will.\nFurther announcements will be made as the Transaction progresses.\nAdditional Disclosures\nFor the twelve months ended 31 December 2023, the revenue attributable to the Execution Only Business was a maximum of \u00a38.55m and the Execution Only Business had nil gross assets.\nIt is intended that the proceeds from the forthcoming sale ",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nJarvis Securities\n(\"Jarvis\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nInterim Results for the Six Months Ended 30 June 2024\nChairman's statement\n\u00b7\n\u00a3877,151 (12.0%) decrease in revenue versus six months to 30 June 2023\n\u00b7\n\u00a31,100.983 (28.9%) decrease in profit before tax versus six months to 30 June 2023\n\u00b7\nCash under administration has decreased 15.5% versus 30 June 2023\n\u00b7\nEPS decreased to 4.55p (2023: 6.52p)\nAs announced on 27 June 2024, Jarvis continues to work through the skilled person recommendations and is creating an additional remediation plan to address the points arising from the report. Phase 2, which requires the Skilled Person to review the remediation work undertaken by JIML on the\u00a0matters raised in any of the three s.166 reports, has now commenced and is expected to be completed by Q4 2024. As part of this work the Skilled Person will also be required to provide a Reasonable Assurance Opinion to the FCA (confirming the Skilled Person is confident as to the completeness of the remediation) along with any final recommendations.\nThe voluntary agreed restrictions (the \"VREQ\") on JIML, as announced on 16th\u00a0September 2022, remain in place. JIML will continue to work with the Skilled Person and the FCA with the aim of having these restrictions lifted on its impacted Model B clients as soon as possible.\nThe ramifications of the S166 review and costs of remediation, combined with market transaction volumes that continue to remain subdued, are reflected in the financial performance for the period. Fortunately, interest rates have remained relatively constant during the past six months, which has been beneficial for Jarvis enabling it to meet these costs and continue to produce overall profit.\nCurrent Trading\nDue to subdued trading volumes; the increasing costs of the Skilled Person review; the costs of the associated remediation work and the ongoing impact of the VREQ on the Company's Model B clients, the directors anticipate that the trading for the full year ending 31 December 2024 will be significantly below market expectations.\nOutlook\nAlthough the regulatory review is ongoing, as a firm we are currently committed to working through it and emerging in a more robust state and ready to focus on the future of the firm and its plans for growth.\nAs always, I would like to thank our staff for their relentless hard work and support over what continues to be a difficult period for the firm.\nEnquiries\n:\nJarvis Securities plc\n01892 510 515\nAndrew Grant\nKieran Price\nZeus Capital Limited\n0203 829 5000\nKaty Mitchell\nDarshan Patel\nKey performance indicators (KPI)\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) are designed to give stakeholders in the business a more rounded view of the Group's performance.

Andrew is now working to strengthen the senior management team of the Company's operating subsidiary, Jarvis Investment Management Limited (\"\nJIML\n\") to help facilitate his retirement. There are no planned changes to the management of Jarvis itself, but there have been, and will continue to be, changes at board and senior management level of JIML. These changes at the operating level are intended to enable a smooth transition, and for Andrew to take a step back from that business over a gradual period.\nThe Directors confirm that Kieran Price will remain as Finance Director of the Company and Steve Middleton will remain as a non-executive director of both the Company and JIML.\nA recruitment process to identify and select Andrew's successor as Managing Director of JIML will be carried out with a number of specialised agencies and it is intended that Andrew would retire from JIML by 31st March 2025. In the interim, with effect from 1 May 2024, Will Kett will be appointed as deputy MD of JIML to assist with the handover of relevant responsibilities.\nAt this stage, and as set out above, Andrew Grant does not intend to retire from, and will remain as Chief Executive Officer of, Jarvis; which, as parent company of the Group, will retain oversight of the Group.\nEnquiries\n:\nJarvis Securities plc 01892 510 515\nAndrew Grant\nWH Ireland Limited 0207 220 1666\nKaty Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nNotes\n:\nJarvis Securities plc is the holding company for Jarvis Investment Management Limited, a stock broking company and outsourced service provider for bespoke tailored financial administration.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n26 March 2024\nJarvis Securities plc\n(\"Jarvis\" or \"the Company\" or \"the Group\")\nRESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n\u00b7\n15% decrease in profit before tax\n\u00b7\n27% decrease in interim dividend per share\n\u00b7\n20% decrease in EPS\nThis year has again been very challenging for Jarvis with the continuing skilled person review and voluntary requirement (\"VREQ\") restrictions on the firm's subsidiary Jarvis Investment Management Limited being the main focus for the firm. This has had a material impact on costs and continues to do so but conversely, the interest rate increases seen towards the end of 2022, as a tool to fight inflation, continued through to Q3 of 2023, which has been of benefit to the Group. Overall, we have traded in line with current expectations for the year.\nWe continue to progress through the skilled person review. We were expecting the skilled person to have provided their draft report for Phase 1c by 28 February 2024. This has been delayed, with the draft report now expected by the end of April 2024. During Q2, we expect the skilled person to start its phase 2\nreview and assurance report on the remediation work we have undertaken to date.\nThe reduction in share transaction volumes first seen in the second half of 2022 has continued throughout 2023.\nThe negative geo-political situations have weighed heavily on the markets due to uncertain outcomes, however the effect of interest rate and cost of living increases on household spending is now much clearer.\nAs already announced in September 2022, the VREQ relates to our Model B Corporate Clients, and over the last 18 months we have continually reviewed those relationships. As a result of our risk assessments and categorisation, a number of Corporate Clients have been off-boarded due to falling outside of our risk appetite, whilst some have simply chosen to transfer elsewhere due to the restrictions of the VREQ. Our Corporate Client universe has remained steady since our assessments were completed in Q3 of the financial year under review and we are pleased to continue to be approached regarding potential new corporate introductions.\nThere have been significant enhancements to the onboarding processes and ongoing monitoring of all our client relationships and our enhanced Compliance Monitoring Plan is underway which will continuously give assurance as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our operations, systems and controls for monitoring compliance risk.\nAn area of change for Jarvis in 2024 is the decision to exit the SIPP market. Jarvis Investment Management Limited will of course work with all clients and SIPP Trustees to assist with a smooth transition to their preferred new custodian or platform provider and enable full closures of these accounts.\nOne of the Group's income streams is interest earned on client funds. This again has seen a significant upturn throughout the year, and has offset the reduction in commission income due to lower trade volumes and the significant one-off costs associated with the skilled person process. However, we are working closely with the skilled person with regard to uninvested client cash, interest retention and term deposits. Any potential impact on those income streams from reductions in funds held should become clearer in the coming months.\nDespite these ongoing challenges the Board and staff at Jarvis remain committed and are working tirelessly so that the business can continue and to build for a stable, resilient future.\nAs always, I would like to thank all off our staff for their hard work and support over what has been another challenging and stressful period.\nAndrew Grant\nChairman\nAnnual General Meeting\nThe Company will today dispatch to shareholders its Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023, together with a notice convening the Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\"), to be held at the Company's offices on Thursday 18th\u00a0April 2024 at 9am.

The Company advises that pursuant to section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"\ns.166\n\") (\"\nFSMA\n\"),\nan additional review (known as phase 1c) (\"Phase 1c\") is required by the FCA to be undertaken in respect of\nits subsidiary, Jarvis Investment Management Ltd (\"\nJIML\n\")\n. Phase 1c will review JIML's approach to uninvested client cash, interest retention and term deposits. The voluntarily agreed restrictions on new Model B business and assets, as detailed in the Announcement, remain in place.\nThe Phase 1C report is due to be delivered\nto the FCA, by no later than 28 February 2024. Further updates will be provided as appropriate.\nThe FCA have also provided additional direction for the pre-existing Phase 2, if required. This phase would include a review and assurance report on the remediation work undertaken by JIML on the matters raised in any of the s.166 reports. This review may be required before the voluntary restrictions on JIML's new business and assets can be lifted. As previously announced, whilst these restrictions remain in place dividends payable by JIML to the Company, and therefore dividends payable by the Company, may be reduced and or delayed.\nFinally, the Directors confirm that the costs associated with the s.166 process, including reports and remediation work, are expected to exceed \u00a31.3m in the current financial year (for the twelve months ended 30 December 2023) (unaudited).

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nJarvis Securities\n(\"Jarvis\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nInterim Results for the Six Months Ended 30 June 2023\nChairman's statement\n\u00b7\n\u00a31,064,977 (17.0%) increase in revenue versus six months to 30 June 2022\n\u00b7\n\u00a3708,463 (22.8%) increase in profit before tax versus six months to 30 June 2022\n\u00b7\nCash under administration has decreased 31.2% versus 30 June 2022\n\u00b7\nEPS increased to 6.52p (2022: 5.62p)\nI am pleased to present a strong set of financial results despite difficult market conditions and the ongoing skilled person review. There has been a lot happening at Jarvis over the past six months which I will attempt to summarise.\nMost importantly, we continue to operate our services as normal to retail clients via ShareDeal Active and X-O platforms. However, in the background we are making significant changes to our processes and controls as recommended in our skilled person review. We have increased the resources in our compliance department to undertake this work, and we anticipate that even when the review is satisfied, we will continue with increased compliance resource within the firm. As part of the review, we have over the last six months been exiting some model B relationships which posed a higher than tolerable risk level for Financial Crime and Money Laundering compliance. This has resulted in a reduction in assets and cash under administration and has been a difficult transition for all parties involved. The model B firms themselves have had to find new outsource providers but it is my belief that this has been the correct course of action for Jarvis' long-term success.\nWithin the market transaction volumes remain subdued. This not only affects Jarvis but all businesses involved in securities transactions. Fortunately, interest rates have continued their upward trend over the past six months which, whilst painful for companies with debt, has been beneficial for Jarvis. The additional income has offset the reduction in commission and fees from lower volumes and the reduced number of model B clients. Interest income has always been a significant contributor to the business model enabling Jarvis to maintain its fixed low-cost commission which has not been increased for over 12 years despite rising costs and the recent high levels of inflation.\nAlthough the regulatory review is ongoing, as a firm we are currently committed to working through it and emerging in a more robust state and ready to focus on the future of the firm and its plans for growth.\nAs always, I would like to thank our staff for their relentless hard work and support over what continues to be a physically and mentally difficult period for the firm.\nEnquiries\n:\nJarvis Securities plc\n01892 510 515\nAndrew Grant\nJolyon Head\nWH Ireland Limited\n0113 394 6600\nKaty Mitchell\nDarshan Patel\nKey performance indicators (KPI)\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) are designed to give stakeholders in the business a more rounded view of the Group's performance.

When I posted the final instruction, i received a  message along the lines of 'this broker is seeing a considerable number of redemptions and hence the wait for the transfer to complete might be longer than normal'.  My message is - don't assume the deal will happen at the current price, and if you're banking on that, you might want to give this further thought! :-)",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

The business is being controlled by advisers (with little to no downward pressure on their costs) who are accountable to regulators.  It is not a going concern.  Shareholders are last in line to receive any residual value from the orderly wind down. I'd say the intrinsic value of the shares is nil.  But I'm happy for my view to be judged by the price one day before delisting. No investors will buy this stock at the moment.  I agree that speculators might buy it.  However there must be alternative speculations with something of a better safety net.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

          "content": "Up 20% today to 21.5p Rns ...Further to the announcement of 15 April 2025 the Company is pleased to confirm that the sale of its retail execution-only brokerage business by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Jarvis Investment Management Limited (\"JIML\") for a total consideration of up to \u00a311m to Interactive Investor Services Limited (the \"Transaction\") has now completed. The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

Although I was one of the first to leave Jarvis, transferring my ISA and taking a big loss on my shares, I found that my ISA transferred quickly, except that two investments were rejected and ended up back with Jarvis. I am now in a long queue to arrange another date for the transfer, as is my wife's account. Hopefully Laura will stop trying to cover up genuine posts now. Of course, Laura probably isn't \"Laura\" at all. I was advised by a group of rampers years ago that it's best to register a female name, as male investors are so gullible.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.

This makes sense because X-O was execution only (clue in the name) whereas II is a subscription model.  I myself have now transferred all my X-O assets elsewhere.  When I posted the final instruction, i received a  message along the lines of 'this broker is seeing a considerable number of redemptions and hence the wait for the transfer to complete might be longer than normal'.  My message is - don't assume the deal will happen at the current price, and if you're banking on that, you might want to give this further thought! :-)",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

Although I was one of the first to leave Jarvis, transferring my ISA and taking a big loss on my shares, I found that my ISA transferred quickly, except that two investments were rejected and ended up back with Jarvis. I am now in a long queue to arrange another date for the transfer, as is my wife's account. Hopefully Laura will stop trying to cover up genuine posts now. Of course, Laura probably isn't \"Laura\" at all. I was advised by a group of rampers years ago that it's best to register a female name, as male investors are so gullible.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

When I posted the final instruction, i received a  message along the lines of 'this broker is seeing a considerable number of redemptions and hence the wait for the transfer to complete might be longer than normal'.

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.

This makes sense because X-O was execution only (clue in the name) whereas II is a subscription model.  I myself have now transferred all my X-O assets elsewhere.  When I posted the final instruction, i received a  message along the lines of 'this broker is seeing a considerable number of redemptions and hence the wait for the transfer to complete might be longer than normal'.  My message is - don't assume the deal will happen at the current price, and if you're banking on that, you might want to give this further thought! :-)",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

Although I was one of the first to leave Jarvis, transferring my ISA and taking a big loss on my shares, I found that my ISA transferred quickly, except that two investments were rejected and ended up back with Jarvis. I am now in a long queue to arrange another date for the transfer, as is my wife's account. Hopefully Laura will stop trying to cover up genuine posts now. Of course, Laura probably isn't \"Laura\" at all. I was advised by a group of rampers years ago that it's best to register a female name, as male investors are so gullible.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

When I posted the final instruction, i received a  message along the lines of 'this broker is seeing a considerable number of redemptions and hence the wait for the transfer to complete might be longer than normal'.

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

I post now because I think I have a relevant viewpoint on the recently announced deal which others might be interested in - kind of what these boards are for, no? As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.  I think it's worth sharing this viewpoint on the Board - not sure why that feels strange to you?",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",

As for the RNS, can I direct you to the following excerpt: \"In addition, it is a condition of the Agreement that the total AUA, and total number of customers, of the Execution Only Business must remain at least 90% of their value at the date of the Agreement throughout this period. In the event that any of the conditions set out in the Agreement are not satisfied Interactive Investor can either extend the period to complete the migration of the relevant clients or immediately terminate the Agreement. \" I think there's reasonable grounds to believe that Jarvis are in the process of losing more than 10% of their AUA, but we'll see.

This makes sense because X-O was execution only (clue in the name) whereas II is a subscription model.  I myself have now transferred all my X-O assets elsewhere.  When I posted the final instruction, i received a  message along the lines of 'this broker is seeing a considerable number of redemptions and hence the wait for the transfer to complete might be longer than normal'.  My message is - don't assume the deal will happen at the current price, and if you're banking on that, you might want to give this further thought! :-)",

The \u00a39m initial consideration is due to be paid to JIML shortly with the remaining \u00a32 million of the consideration deferred for up to c.18 months, and subject to potential adjustment for claims under the sale agreement. Please refer to the Company's announcement of 15 April 2025 for further details. Outlook Following the Transaction, the Group now mainly comprises the Model 'B' clearing and settlement service business within JIML (the \"Model B Arrangements\") and as announced on 15 April 2025 the Group has already begun the process of terminating the Model B Arrangements and closing down its other operations. This process is anticipated to take approximately 15 months to complete. The Group is now committed to delivering an effective and efficient wind down over the coming months. As previously announced, now that the Transaction has completed and once the Model B Arrangements are terminated and other operations wound down, Jarvis would then no longer own, control, or conduct any trading business. Accordingly, pursuant to AIM Rule 15 Jarvis would, at that time, become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell and would be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions that constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14, within 6 months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell. It is currently anticipated Jarvis will become an AIM Rule 15 Cash Shell on the date that all, or substantially all, of JIML's client agreements or assets are transferred to a third party. At this time, the Directors do not intend to make any acquisitions. Whilst they continue to keep their strategic options for the remaining assets of the Group under review, the Directors currently intend to seek a cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM pursuant to AIM Rule 41 (the \"Proposed Cancellation\") in due course, with the expectation that, following the lifting of the VREQ, any distributable reserves remaining in the Company at the time of the Proposed Cancellation would then be returned to shareholders. The Proposed Cancellation would be subject, inter alia, to shareholder approval. Further announcements will be made in due course.",
