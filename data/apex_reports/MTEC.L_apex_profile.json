This represents an increase in margin from 8.2% to c.8.7%, a result of operational efficiencies, offset by a higher than target contractor base.\nNet cash as at 30 November 2025 was \u00a311.9 million (FY25: \u00a310.4 million; H1 FY25: \u00a39.1 million), reflecting the continuing strong operating cash flow conversion of the business. Made Tech remains debt-free.\nAs at 30 November 2025 Contracted Backlog\n3\nwas c.\u00a374.0 million (FY25: \u00a392.2 million; H1 FY25: \u00a380.8 million) which provides good contractual coverage for the remainder of FY26 and into FY27. Sales bookings for H1 FY26 were\nsofter than the strong prior year performance\nbut the Sales Booking pipeline remains very active with a number of opportunities expected to increase the Contracted Backlog position in H2.\nAs a result of the strong trading performance in the first half of the year, the Board now expects trading for FY26 to be significantly ahead of current market expectations\n4\n, with revenue expected to be c.10% higher and Adjusted EBITDA margins increasing, reflecting improved operational gearing. The Group looks forward to announcing its Interim results for the 6 month period ended 30 November 2025 in February 2026.\nRory MacDonald, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"The first half of 2026 has been an exceptionally strong period for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, building on the momentum seen in FY25. Robust cash generation has further improved our balance sheet position and the strategic optionality this provides. Our near-term focus remains on sales pipeline conversion and adding to our already solid Contracted Backlog position, giving us good visibility into FY27.\nThe UK Government has emphasised the significant role technology will play in delivering its priorities, and we believe the Group continues to be well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities. Consequently, we remain optimistic and confident in our outlook.\"\nNotes:\nAll financials are based on unaudited figures.\n1\nSales Bookings represent the total value of sales contracts awarded in the Period, to be delivered in FY26-FY30. Net Sales Bookings includes the value of sales contracts previously recognised that lapsed during the Period.\n2\nAdjusted EBITDA has been adjusted for the exclusion of depreciation, amortisation, impairments, exceptional items and share-based payment charge.\n3\nContracted Backlog is the value of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognised.\n4\nBased on the latest published equity research, the Company understands current market consensus for the year ended 31 May 2026 (FY26) to be revenue of \u00a350.1m, Adjusted EBITDA of \u00a33.9m and cash of \u00a313.1m, and for the year ended 31 May 2027 (FY27) to be revenue of \u00a355.1m, Adjusted EBITDA of \u00a34.4m and cash of \u00a316.1m.\nEnquiries:\nMade Tech Group plc\nRory MacDonald, CEO\nNeil Elton, CFO\nEmail: investor-relations@madetech.com\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nSimon Bridges / Harry Gooden / Andrew Potts / Elizabeth Halley-Stott\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7523 8000\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
