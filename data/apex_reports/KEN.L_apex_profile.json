The Convertible Loan Facility is convertible, at the Convertible Conversion price save that if prior to repayment there is a 'Qualifying Financing', being any issue of new shares for cash at less than the Convertible Conversion Price the loan will convert at the price and on the same terms as the relevant 'Qualifying Financing'. The agreement includes customary terms and conditions for a facility of this nature.\nRelated Party Transaction - Convertible Loan Facility\nColin Bird is a director of the Company, so a related party for the purposes of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (\"DTRs\"), the participation by Colin Bird in the Convertible Loan Facility constitutes a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3 as it is for more than 5% of the aggregate amount of the Convertible Loan Facility and the Additional Loan Tranche (the \"\nRelated Party Transaction\n\"). Colin Bird's participation in the Convertible Loan Facility is on the same terms as the other Lenders and provides additional capital for the group's operations, accordingly the independent directors, being Marytn Churchouse, Alex Borrelli, Kjeld Thygesen and Evan Kirby, consider Colin Bird's participation in the Convertible Loan Facility to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nSanderson Facility\nThe terms of the\n\u00a3375,000 drawn down under the pre-existing Sanderson Facility remain the same save that the maturity date has been extended to 30 June 2027.\u00a0The Additional Loan Tranche terms are as follows:\nRepayment and Conversion\nRepayment\nUnless otherwise converted, the Company must repay the Additional Loan Tranche on 31 January 2027 (the\n\"Repayment Date\")\n.

The processing fundamentals are good and the final product is above international average. Notwithstanding this, the fundamentals for vanadium have not emerged as strongly as the industry had expected and the use of vanadium in energy storage has not advanced as fast as energy generation.\nIt is the Board's intention to maintain the vanadium property in Sweden, Airijoki, whilst not continuing with the nickel projects within Norway and Sweden. The Board has taken the decision to acquire projects in the copper and gold arena in Southern Africa and during the period acquired an option over the Bluefox exploration project in Northwest Zambia, close to the Angolan border. The Company is currently investigating a number of ventures to enhance its southern Africa portfolio in commodities which have a real future; brownfields or production in jurisdictions which are supportive of mining.\nWe will keep shareholders advised on our progress with this mission.\nColin Bird\nExecutive Chairman\n29 September 2025\nOPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL CORPORATE and STRATEGY REVIEWS\nOperational and Strategy Review\nThe Company's strategy is to enhance the value of its mineral resource projects through exploration and technical studies conducted by the Company or through joint venture or other arrangements with a view to establishing the projects can be economically mined for profit. The Group has been seeking to do this by building an energy metals production business focused on nickel, vanadium and copper mineral resources projects in Scandinavia. During the period, having assessed the current funding market for nickel exploration and development companies and the operational and maintenance costs of its projects and their relative prospectivity, the Board decided to focus on its Airijoki vanadium energy storage project in Sweden notwithstanding the prospectivity of its other projects were they fully funded and accordingly in its 2024 accounts made a full provision against all its exploration projects other than the Airijoki vanadium project in Sweden.\nGiven the Board's extensive resource project experience in Southern Africa and the relative cost of developing projects in Southern Africa compared to Scandinavia the Board has decided that it is in the best interest of shareholders to seek new resource project opportunities in areas where the Board has expertise in, including Southern Africa, which is what it has been focusing on doing during the period and will update shareholders when an appropriate projects(s) are identified and in the meantime the Group will seek to minimise costs.\nSummary of Retained Airijoki Project:\nThe Airijoki vanadium copper project in Sweden comprises seven contiguous exploration permits covering 39.41 km2 and is supported by an Inferred Mineral Resource comprising 44.3 Mt at an in-situ grade of 0.4% V2O5, containing 5.9 Mt of magnetite averaging 1.7% V2O5 (in magnetite concentrate) for 100,800 t of contained V2O5 based on a 13.3% mass recovery of magnetite concentrate and a 0.7% V2O5 cut-off grade, on a 100% equity basis (and net attributable basis).\nThe main field exploration focus since the acquisition of the Airijoki project was a 1,394 metre exploration drill program at the Airijoki vanadium copper project in Sweden conducted late in 2023 the results of which were announced on 8 February 2024.\nThe highlights of the drill results were:\n\u00b7\nResults have been received for whole rock and vanadium magnetite concentrates produced from eight holes drilled north of the existing Airijoki vanadium JORC Mineral Resource containing 44.3 Mt @ 0.4% V2O5, in-situ, containing 5.9 Mt of magnetite averaging 1.7% V2O5.\n\u00b7\nSeven out of eight holes drilled intersected Vanadium mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nNotable intercepts included:\no\n0.52% V2O5 - whole rock (1.77% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 28.80m from 77.55m in hole AIR23-003, incl.\n\u00a7\n0.72% V2O5 - whole rock (2.15% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 12.00m from 89.50m\no\n0.43% V2O5 - whole rock (1.44% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 19.15m from 75.85m in hole AIR23-008\no\n0.32% V2O5 - whole rock (1.42% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 28.65m from 174.50m in AIR23-002\n\u00a7\nincl. 0.40% V2O5 - whole rock (1.75% V2O5 -magnetite concentrate) ov",

The project area covers 39.41km2 and has an inferred mineral resource comprising of 44.3million tonnes of an in-situ grade with 5.9million tonnes of magnetite averaging 1.7% VTO5.\nThe exploration work to date indicates the potential to at least double the size of the Airijoki project and external metallurgical test work has demonstrated that increasing recovery, whilst maintaining concentrate grade, is a strong possibility.\nIn addition, we have identified potential for copper, nickel, cobalt, gold and palladium, which are coincident with underlying airborne geophysical anomalies. Thus, we have a multi-commodity project area, underpinned by the Vanadium project and, in a tight market for exploration companies, we have decided that in Scandinavia the Group will focus on the Airijoki Vanadium project and make an impairment provision against its other vanadium projects in Sweden and Finland due to their relative lack of prospectivity compared to the Airijoki project.\nNickel Projects:\nThe Nickel projects in Sweden and Norway, all indicate scope for increased discovery with the Mjovattnet and Njuggtraskliden projects being open ended with a combined potential of 25km of strike (\"Swedish Nickel Line Projects\"). The Norwegian Nickel properties within the Espedalen Nickel complex have good potential for sulphide nickel and contain 10 untested targets (\"Norwegian Nickel Projects\"). However at the time of writing this report the nickel producing industry has been severely tested by the massive investment by the Chinese into Indonesia. Resulting flows of nickel from Indonesia have severely adversely affected the supply demand balance with a negative effect on the nickel price and the ability to raise funds for nickel exploration projects. Many nickel miners and exploration companies around the world have been forced to close and / or re-focus their operations. The Board does not anticipate that this situation will change in the short to midterm and are thus reluctant to commit to new nickel exploration programmes which are unlikely to produce new mines within a reasonable forecastable timeframe. Against this backdrop, the Board has decided to discontinue Nickel exploration in Scandinavia and make a full impairment provision against the Swedish Nickel Line and Norwegian Nickel Projects.\nResults for the year:\nThe Group reported a loss before taxation for the year of \u00a33,437,121 (2023: \u00a31,099,162) mainly due to administrative costs of \u00a3693,059 (2023: \u00a3580,287), including professional, consulting and directors' fees and an impairment of \u00a32,737,711 (2023: \u00a3448,904) against licences we h",

The Espedalen and Airijoki assets are the Company's two most advanced projects.\nTechnical review of Projects:\nFollowing Admission to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in May 2022 and having acquired its projects in Sweden, Finland and exercised its option in relation to its Norwegian projects, the Group commenced technical reviews and / or programmes on its portfolio. The primary metal in the Swedish and Finnish projects is vanadium and nickel for the Norwegian projects. Since their acquisition the group commenced technical reviews of its Swedish Nickel Projects.\nSummary of Projects:\nThe Projects are a portfolio of early to advanced stage exploration projects covering a combined area of 658 km2 in Scandinavia. The most advanced of these Projects are the Airijoki and Koitelainen vanadium projects in Sweden and Finland respectively and the Espedalen nickel copper project in Norway. The other projects are:\n\u00b7\nSweden - the\nNjuggtraskliden and Mjovattnet exploration (\"Swedish\nNickel Projects\n\")\n\u00b7\nSweden - the Kullberget, Simesvallen and Sum\u00e5ssj\u00f6n exploration projects in Sweden (collectively the \"\nCentral Sweden Project\n\")\nThe Airijoki vanadium copper project in Sweden comprising seven contiguous exploration permits covering 39.41 km2 is supported by an Inferred Mineral Resource comprising 44.3 Mt at an in-situ grade of 0.4% V2O5, containing 5.9 Mt of magnetite averaging 1.7% V2O5 (in magnetite concentrate) for 100,800 t of contained V2O5 based on a 13.3% mass recovery of magnetite concentrate and a 0.7% V2O5 cut-off grade, on a 100% equity basis (and net attributable basis).\nThe Koitelainen vanadium copper project in Finland comprising a single granted exploration licence covering 13.72 km2 with an Inferred Mineral Resource has been defined at the Koitelainen Vosa Prospect comprising 116.4Mt, containing 5.8 million tonnes of magnetite @ 2.3% V2O5 (in magnetite concentrate), for 131,000 tonnes of V2O5 based on 5.0% Mass Recovery of magnetite concentrate and a cut-off of 0.5% V. The Inferred Mineral Resource was estimated in accordance with JORC (2012), utilising data from 3,784m of drilling from 27 historical drill holes.\nThe Espedalen nickel-copper project in Norway comprising 16 contiguous exploration permits covering a combined area of 139.89 km2 and currently contains the following two nickel deposits with associated Mineral Resource estimates together with other prospects and was the subject of a successful drill programme during 2023:\n\u00b7\nStormyra deposit comprising 1.16Mt @ 1% Ni, 0.42% Cu & 0.04% Co and classified as Inferred in accordance with JORC (2012)\n\u00b7\nDalen deposit comprising 7.8Mt @ 0.3% Ni, 0.12% Cu & 0.02% Co and classified as Inferred in accordance with JORC (2012)\nNorway Projects:\nOur review has led us to identify significant opportunities with the nickel projects in Norway. Our thorough review of historic exploration data combined with nickel price forecasting results in Kendrick being extremely well positioned with our Norwegian nickel assets. Our priority Norwegian nickel target, the Espedalen Project (1.16Mt @ 1% Ni, 0.42% Cu & 0.04% Co) and more specifically the Stormyra prospect was drilled in March 2023 with 19 holes completed for a total of 1,650 metres of drilling over an initial 1,200m of strike length.

Nickel derived from laterites requires significantly more energy and is extremely complex for metallurgical recovery compared to nickel sulphide ores. The value of Kendrick's nickel assets is further strengthened by being in Norway and Sweden which are considered stable jurisdictions with favourable mining legislation and overarching European legislation focused on strategic raw materials and security of supply.\nHaving recognised the issues facing the battery industry, Kendrick has directed its Scandinavian mission to locate sulphide sources that may meet the nickel supply shortfall which the Board regards as being inevitable.\nHighlights\nGeneral\n\u00b7\nRatification this month of the European Commission's Critical Raw Materials Act 2024 should be beneficial for both funding and development of the projects\n\u00b7\nKendrick's Swedish Projects are particularly well located being based in the centre of the Swedish car and battery-making industries\n\u00b7\nGovernments are receptive to new mining ventures together with major mining companies\n\u00b7\nAll projects have copper in association with nickel\n\u00b7\nGeological investigation and academia indicate the Swedish projects may be analogous to the Thompson nickel Belt (Manitoba)\nSwedish projects\n\u00b7\nThe Njuggtr\u00e4skliden and Mj\u00f6vattnet projects (acquired in 2023 post Listing)\nare exceptional in their potential and Kendrick is pleased to have acquired the properties from its royalty partner EMX Royalty Corporation\n\u00b7\nCharacterised by wide mineralised intersections at good grades (Tables 1 & 2 below) and amenable to open pit mining\n\u00b7\nNjuggtr\u00e4skliden currently offering a NiEq grade* of up to 2.42% Ni, equivalent to $419 per tonne of ore\n\u00b7\nA combined 25km of highly prospective strike length at Njuggtr\u00e4skliden (10km) and Mj\u00f6vattnet (15km).\nNorwegian Projects\n\u00b7\nEspedalen rapidly developing into a nickel camp with two prospects with resources greater than 1Mt each.\n\u00b7\nStormyra prospect recently identified an additional 500m of drill-ready strike length to extend its current 1.16Mt @ 1% Ni, 0.42% Cu & 0.04% Co.\n*Nickel Equivalent (NiEq) based on the following metal prices: nickel $17,300 per tonne, copper$9,700 per tonne, platinum $32 per gram and palladium $33 per gram\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman of Kendrick Resources Plc\nsaid \"Our Swedish nickel projects are exceptional in as much as they offer higher grade nickel with copper notwithstanding the contributions of PGEs1 and cobalt. Njuggtr\u00e4skliden and Mj\u00f6vattnet are located a few kilometres from the battery manufacturer Northvolt and are only 100 kilometres by sea from the Kokkola nickel smelter that can selectively extract these metals. We are excited to work this project and test the 25 kilometres of strike to add significant near-surface resources to the current resource. Work at Espedalen in Norway will continue with the focus being on the drill-ready additional strike length expected to add to the existing mineral resource.

The work was very successful and the results revealed much about the geo-metallurgy of the orebody, which we will incorporate into future mine planning.\nGlobal production of vanadium is currently just over 100,000 tonnes per year with China and Russia responsible for about 65% and 20% of production respectively. Steelmaking has been responsible for over 90% of vanadium consumption and demand has been strong due to global adoption of higher strength rebar specifications and increasing use of vanadium containing steel by the automotive industry. The use of vanadium in REDOX vanadium storage batteries is increasing with the focus on alternative energy sources. We have no doubt that power storage will command much more importance as the decade continues.\nWe mounted a significant drilling programme in Norway at our Espedalen nickel complex, reporting good intersection of over 1% nickel, which will be described in the operation section. The nickel complex is showing itself to be highly prospective with at least 10 untested targets. The prognosis for significant increase in nickel tonnage is very good and we intend to carry out further drilling programmes during Q4 2024. In reviewing all historical information available on the project, we identified a potentially significant magnetic anomaly, which may represent the high-grade roots to the overall system.\nIn July we acquired from EMX Royalties the Mjovattnet and Njuggtraskliden nickel, copper and PGM licences (\"Swedish Nickel\"). A number of boreholes will be reviewed in the operational review, but we are very pleased with this acquisition based on its history and potential. Between the two projects, we have some 25km potential strike to investigate. The geological environment of the project is being likened to the Thompson Nickel belt in Manitoba, Canada, which is a major nickel supplier in Canada. The acquisition is made even more interesting by its proximity to battery manufacturing facilities and the eastern coast of mid-Sweden, together with Boliden's nickel refinery, which is some 100km by sea away.\nThe initial part of the reporting period was spent in establishing a management team that is able to work within the cost regimes we are accustomed to and, also previous experience of working the Scandinavian geological environment.\nTowards the end of the period, it became obv",

The combination of a JORC Mineral Resource, new positive assay results and access to a further 5 contiguous exploration licences expected to generate additional vanadium (and copper) targets for follow up and possible future expansion of the current vanadium resource, has initiated the next step in the development of the Company's vanadium programme.\nThe immediate emphasis will be to switch from further drilling to expanding the Mineral Resource, to focusing on the development and implementation of an appropriate strategy to build a sustainable vanadium business, this does not preclude future ongoing exploration. But in the meantime we will be looking to build strategic alliances with both iron ore and vanadium miners and processors, together with an alignment with end users of vanadium, principally in the Vanadium Redox battery sphere. Operating to the highest possible standards, the Company aims to become a significant contributor to the supply of vanadium in the Scandinavian battery arena.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nResults have been received for whole rock and vanadium magnetite concentrates produced from eight holes drilled north of the existing Airijoki vanadium JORC Mineral Resource containing 44.3 Mt @ 0.4% V2O5, in-situ, containing 5.9 Mt of magnetite averaging 1.7% V2O5.\n\u00b7\nSeven out of eight holes drilled intersected Vanadium mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nNotable intercepts included:\no\n0.52% V2O5 - whole rock (1.77% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 28.80m from 77.55m in hole AIR23-003, incl.\n\u00a7\n0.72% V2O5 - whole rock (2.15% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 12.00m from 89.50m\no\n0.43% V2O5 - whole rock (1.44% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 19.15m from 75.85m in hole AIR23-008\no\n0.32% V2O5 - whole rock (1.42% V2O5 - magnetite concentrate) over 28.65m from 174.50m in AIR23-002\n\u00a7\nincl. 0.40% V2O5 - whole rock (1.75% V2O5 -magnetite concentrate) over 12 m from 186.5m\n\u00b7\nEndorsement by the Board of the development of a strategy aimed at building a sustainable vanadium business in Scandinavia to deliver into future vanadium demand for battery production.\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman of Kendrick Resources Plc commented:\n\"I am delighted to see that this drilling campaign testing the northern extension to the existing 44.3 Mt Airijoki JORC Resource carries good whole rock Vanadium grades as well as Vanadium magnetite concentrate grades demonstrating the potential to add to the existing resource at Airijoki. Development of resources at Airijoki has required evaluation including rock and soil sampling to both confirm historic anomalies and to define new targets to explain underlying geophysical anomalies with work programmes confined to certain times of the year to minimise the impact of exploration. It is always rewarding to receive highly positive results derived from the exploration team's hard work and dedication. The fact that we have a number of other high quality defined drill targets on the as-yet largely untested licences comprising the Airijoki project, bodes well for future resource growth.\nKendrick is evolving and, having achieved a critical mass in terms of resource tonnes and grade underpinned by strong evidence to suggest scope for significant growth, the Board believes now is the right time for the Company to build alliances and establish long-term commercial cooperation agreements necessary to ensure a market for future vanadium production. We look forward to expanding on our proposed strategy and updating shareholders as we evolve as a company\".\nDrilling Programme and Results\nKendrick Resources Plc has received geochemical results from all the diamond drill holes completed at Airijoki towards the end of 2023 with all but one hole intersecting Vanadium mineralisation.\nThe eight hole 1,394m scout diamond drilling program in the Airijoki 200 license is located immediately to the northeast of the Airijoki 100 license in which the 44.3Mt JORC compliant Inferred Vanadium resource is estimated.\nThe whole rock, as well as results for vanadium magnetite concentrates, produced by Davis Tube Recovery (\"DTR\"), confirm the possibility to extend the current JORC compliant inferred Vanadium resource to the north for approximately a further circa 2 km.\nFigure 1.

The results will form part of further technical studies leading to drilling. The opportunity to build on the historical mineral resource of 1.1Mt at 1.1% Ni and 0.50% Cu is looking extremely likely, placing Stormyra as the forefront deposit within the Espedalen Complex for development.\nBased on the successful outcome of the geophysical study at Stormyra, we are now minded to roll out this programmeme across the rest of the Espedalen Complex where a further 10 prospects have been identified and tested with drilling, with some returning intercepts greater than 1% Ni, and where further targeted exploratory studies are likely to add additional resources to the Complex.\nOur preliminary investigations over the Complex have enhanced the Espedalen project and provide clear evidence for the development of an as yet undetermined resource tonnage most likely at cumulative grades exceeding 1% Ni with a significant copper and possibly cobalt by-product. \"\nIntroduction\nThe successful 2023 drilling programmeme was followed up by two ground geophysical surveys to provide insight into the potential extent of the mineralized zones at Stormyra. The recently completed interpretation of the geophysical survey results supports the premise that mineralisation extends beyond the current resource area where there has been no drilling.\nGround Magnetic Survey\nThe interpretation of the ground magnetic survey has revealed several linear magnetic anomalies. Two dominant fault orientations, striking northwest-southeast and north-northwest-south-southeast, were recognized that can be explained by the main regional deformation events. A comparison with the outline of the known mineralisation indicates that the mineralisation zone strikes parallel to delineated northwest-southeast linear structures. Notably, an intense linear magnetic anomaly in the northwestern part of the area aligns with the known shallow occurrence of the main mineralized zone. Based on the spatial coherence of known mineralisation relative to magnetic anomalies, two prospective areas have been identified (see Figure 1). Like the known mineralisation, these zones coincide with northwest-southeast striking linear magnetic anomalies within an intermediate-low background magnetic field. One of the prospective areas occurs about 500m southeast of the nearest drill hole. This confirms the results of a historic ground EM survey over the area that indicated a similar extent of the mineralisation of about 500m towards the southeast. The other prospective area occurs about 150m to the southwest parallel to the currently drilled mineralized trend and could be indicative of the mineralisation extending to surface.\nIn response to these encouraging findings, a diamond drilling programme is planned to test the strike extent of mineralisation towards the southeast and assess the width of the zone both up and down dip.\nFigure 1. Map over the Stormyra mineralization displaying the results and interpretation of the 2023 ground magnetic survey and planned drill holes.\nElectromagnetic (EM) Survey\nIn addition to the ground magnetic survey, a transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey was conducted.

We have now drill tested two of the seven licences that comprise the project area and these untested licences have been covered by historic and recent soil geochemistry and geophysics showing similar characteristics to that which has so far led to fresh vanadium discoveries. It is our intention to continue to build a substantial vanadium resource. Further metallurgical test work is required, and this process will continue as we expand our programme\"\nDrilling Programme\nThe Airijoki 200 license is located immediately to the northeast of the Airijoki 100 license in which the 44.3Mt JORC Inferred Vanadium mineral resource is estimated and is prematurely terminated between the license boundaries (Figure 1).\nThe drill program targeted the magnetic anomaly produced from a Ground Magnetic Survey completed in March 2021, which coincided with the inferred mineral resource and extended through into the Airijoki 200 license.\nA total of 1394 m were drilled from 8 holes and from visible observations and portable XRF (pXRF) point measurements taken every meter, the continuity of the vanadium mineralisation is confirmed. Anomalous vanadium concentrations were detected by pXRF in 7 out of the 8 holes.\nThe mineralised samples have been dispatched to the laboratory for assay, to determine the V, and V2O5 concentrations in both whole rock and magnetic concentrate more accurately. The assay results are expected to confirm continuity of the Vanadium mineralisation and the potential to significantly expand the current Vanadium resource at Airijoki and will be announced in due course once received and assessed by the Company.\nFigure 1.

Kendrick also announced on 31 January 2023 the appointment of Martyn Churchouse as managing director and the addition to its exploration team of Vassillios Carellas as operations director and Edine Bakker as an exploration geologist.\nTechnical review of Projects:\nFollowing the IPO in May 2022 and having acquired its projects in Sweden and Finland and exercised its option in relation to its Norwegian projects the Company commenced technical reviews and exploration programmes focussing on both nickel and vanadium in all three countries. Mining and associated legislation in Scandinavia is well-established and decisive enabling Kendrick to make rapid progress on a number of projects.\nSummary of Projects:\nThe projects comprise a portfolio of early to advanced stage exploration assets covering a combined area of 466.72 km2 in Scandinavia. The most advanced of these Projects are the Airijoki and Koitelainen vanadium projects in Sweden and Finland respectively and the Espedalen nickel project in Norway.\nThe Airijoki and Karhujupukka vanadium and Espedalen nickel projects all support defined mineral resources prepared in accordance with the JORC Code (2012.) The remaining projects largely represent brown and greenfield exploration opportunities based on the results of historical activities, some with historical mineral estimates that remain to be\nupdated to the requirements of the JORC Code (2012).\nNorway Projects:\nOur review has led us to identify significant opportunities with the nickel projects in Norway. Our thorough review of historic exploration data combined with nickel price forecasting results in Kendrick being extremely well positioned with our Norwegian nickel assets. Our priority Norwegian nickel target, the Espedalen Project (1.16Mt @ 1% Ni, 0.42% Cu & 0.04% Co) and more specifically the Stormyra prospect was drilled in March 2023 with 19 holes completed for a total of 1,650 metres of drilling over an initial 1,200m of strike length. The results of the programme were announced on 20 April 2023, 4 May 2023 and 24 May 2023 including several drill intercept highlights:\n\u00b7\nHole ES2302 - 6.85% Ni Eq. over 1.25m from 38.20m\n\u00b7\nHole ES2303 - 2.64% Ni Eq. over 3.75m from 44.45m\no\nincl. 9.28% Ni Eq. over 0.75m from 47.45m\no\nand 1.53% Ni Eq. over 5.80m from 51.80m\no\nincl. 5.33% Ni Eq. over 0.9m from 56.7m\n\u00b7\nHole ES2305 - 1.30% Ni Eq. over 4.60m from 76.70m\no\nincl. 2.59% Ni Eq. over 2.10m from 79.20m\n\u00b7\nHole ES2306 - 0.71% Ni Eq. over 10.6m from 96.50m\no\nIncl. 2.18% Ni Eq. over 1.70m from 99.20m\n\u00a7\nand 1.03% Ni Eq. over 2.65m from 104.45m\n\u00a7\nHole ESP2308 - 3.39% Ni Eq. over 11.60m from 52.40m including 5.80% Ni Eq over 4.9m from 59.1m\n\u00b7\nHole ESP2307 - 2.59% Ni Eq. over 3.65m from 37.80m including 4.85% Ni Eq. over 1.80m from 38.50m\n\u00b7\nHole ESP2312 - 2.29% Ni Eq. over 4.15m from 92.35m\n\u00b7\nHole ESP2313 - 1.98% Ni Eq. over 3.55m from 79.60m including 3.86% Ni Eq. over 1.70m from 79.60m\n\u00b7\nHole ESP2317 - 2.18% Ni Eq. over 3.50m from 61.50m\n\u00b7\nHole ESP2318 - 0.41% Ni Eq. over 9.20m from 31.50m incl.\n1.15% Ni Eq. over 0.90m from 35.20m\n\u00b7\nHole ESP2319 - 2.43% Ni Eq. over 2.10m from 53.60m\nincl. 5.53% Ni Eq. over 0.65m from 54.35m\nand\n1.33% Ni Eq. over 2.70m from 62.20m\nGeophysics and interpretation of drilling indicates a further extension to known mineralisation of approximately 500m along the southern limit of the current orebody which is expected to increase the mineral resource.\nThe drill programme over Stormyra was very successful with impressive peak intercepts have provided all the motivation the Company needs to both extend the Stormyra mineralised trend and assess with further drilling multiple other targets (some of which have been drilled and intersected Ni mineralisation) across the Espedalen project area.\nThanks to our local team, we have managed to build a helathy relationship with the local stakeholders and we will continue to communicate with interested and affected parties and we are sufficiently confident of the continuity of mineralisation to formally engage external engineering advice for the review of future plant design.\nSwedish & Finnish Projects:\nThe focus during the period was the Airijoki vanadium project.

We are confident for the potential of strike extension as well as well as generating future targets within the licence. The current soil programme will greatly assist us in this direction.\nWe will report the results for both the drilling and soil sampling programme as they are completed and interpreted by the company's geologist and third-party consultants were appropriate.\"\nAirijoki Exploration strategy:\nEarlier in the year the Company set out its intention to increase the mineral Resource at Airijoki which currently stands at 44.3Mt @ 0.4% V2O5 for 100,800 tonnes of contained V2O5 and this programme is progressing on two fronts;\n\u00b7\nFirstly, with additional geochemical surveys over our most recent licence acquisitions where coincident prospective vanadium and copper in soil and rock values and geophysical anomalies are suggestive of a continuation of the geology that has generated the maiden resource.\n\u00b7\nSecondly, the drill programme has commenced and feedback from site indicates promising intercepts of magnetite-bearing rock are clearly present which is expected to host vanadium.\nThe current focus is on the known geophysical extension of the current Mineral Resource within Licence Nr 200 where the geophysical signature clearly shows a continuous anomalous extension where earlier drilling on the adjacent Kendrick licence intersected vanadium-bearing lithologies.\nThere is a noticeable groundswell of interest and commitment to Vanadium Redox Battery technology. It is all very well generating renewable energy but the ability to store excess energy has to some extent been overlooked. The benefits of the Vanadium Redox system make it an ideal static battery storage option and the intention is to ensure that Kendrick is well-placed to be a provider of vanadium in the future\".\nAirijoki\nDrilling Programme\nThe Airijoki 200 licence is located immediately to the northeast of the Airijoki 100 licence in which the 44.3Mt JORC Inferred Vanadium resource is estimated. Following the completion of a Magnetic Ground Survey in March 2021 over the Airijoki 200 licence, it can be deduced with a reasonable amount of confidence that the Vanadium mineralisation extends and continues to the northeast into this licence area.\nA public meeting was held at the Vittangi community hall at the end of July where representatives of the Company presented the proposed drill programme to the attendees and answered all queries related to the programme.\nThe initial diamond drill exploration programme is based on a line spacing of 400m along strike, with a total of 10 holes and approximately ~1,500m being drilled.\nThe programme is expected to take around 8 weeks to complete and should this programme be successful, it is anticipated that it has the potential to significantly expand the current Vanadium resource at Airijoki.\nFigure 1. is a map showing magnetic survey, JORC Inferred Resource outline and proposed location of drillholes.\nFigure 2. is a cross-section showing proposed drill hole locations and traces along with interpreted magnetic anomalies being targeted.\nFigure 1.

These latest results have continued the trend and more importantly have demonstrated that the proposed southerly extension of the orebody defined by geophysics has been confirmed by our recent drilling.\nBased on the geophysical data we have potentially several hundred metres of strike length to test to broadly delineate the Stormyra orebody. We also have a further 10 high quality nickel targets within our licence that all have drill intercepts that exceed 1% Ni. We are investigating each target and prioritising them ahead of further drilling.\nWe will continue to build a relationship with local stakeholders, and we are sufficiently confident of the continuity of mineralisation to formally engage external engineering advice for the review of future plant design.\nKendrick has several other prospective nickel properties in Norway that are being reviewed in a broader context of a regional nickel programme. The Hosanger Licence hosts the former Litland Ni mine where more than 50 historic boreholes are under investigation ahead of Kendrick defining drill targets. Also, the Sigdal Licence hosts a target with a single drillhole intercept of 0.36% Ni, 0.43% Cu & 10.1g/t Au over 1.48m\".\nDrilling Programme\nKendrick's maiden diamond drill programme at the Stormyra Ni-Cu-Co Deposit (see Kendrick's RNS dated: 31 January 2023) concluded on 1 March 2023, encompassing 19 boreholes, comprising infill, step-out, and exploration holes, spanning a total of 1,650 metres (Figure 1.).\nFigure 1. Drill Hole Location Map for the Stormyra Deposit, Espedalen, Norway\nA subset of 225 metres was forwarded to ALS Scandinavia AB for processing. After the core had been logged, the selected drill core intervals were dispatched to the ALS laboratory in Mal\u00e5, Sweden for preparation and analysed at ALS Loughrea, Ireland.\nThe third and final batch of samples sent to the laboratory, consisting of five out of the six holes drilled, have been received and are illustrated (Figures 2. - 4.) as well as tabulated (Table 1.) below.\nFigure 2.

The Stormyra orebody is shaping up to be a potential shallow underground operation with minimal surface impact. Results to date have exceeded expectations and the mineralised widths of recent intercepts are particularly encouraging especially when linked to grades of more than 1% Ni. These recent intercepts reinforce our decision to continue to evaluate the southern untested extension of Stormyra deposit and it is important to reiterate that we have a further 10 prospects within the Espedalen Project all containing nickel intersections of at least 5m at grades >1% Ni\".\nDrilling Programme\nKendrick's maiden diamond drill programme at the Stormyra Ni-Cu-Co Deposit (see Kendrick's RNS dated: 31 January 2023) concluded on 1 March 2023, encompassing 19 boreholes, comprising infill, step-out, and exploration holes, spanning a total of 1,650 metres (Figure 1.).\nFigure 1.

This systematic data review often reduces the need for some expenditure and often one encounters work, which whilst relevant at the time, under new conditions could assume new relevance. This was the case in all of our projects and the Company has entered 2023 with many more opportunities, than immediately after Admission.\nA review of our portfolio led to a potential contribution reranking, and it is evident that our nickel positions have short term opportunities and thus we carried out a full review of our nickel projects in Norway. The results of this review were that all of our nickel projects, without exception, present significant opportunity for extension, leading to resource increase and short-term mining potential.\nThe ownership of nickel sulphide licences can be considered a premium asset in a world of reducing sulphide availability against metallurgically very complex and financially challenging laterite projects. Our position is enhanced by a nickel price which is some three times higher than when the last serious nickel exploration occurred in our project area. We have carried out a drilling programme and by the time of this Chairman's report is disseminated, the results will be in the public domain.\nOur vanadium activities in Sweden, were subjected to review and soil and grab sampling programmes were carried out and the prognosis is that the area, which now includes an additional two licences, may also be highly prospective for copper and graphite along with the known vanadium resource. The work carried out has given us high confidence that our proposed Spring drilling programme has the potential to double the current known resource of 44 million tonnes.\nDuring the period under review, samples were sent to metallurgical laboratories in the UK, with a view to assessing whether the concentrate quality can be maintained, whilst increasing the actual recovery of the product. The results of this work to date, have been very encouraging and a full report should be available for market dissemination during the second quarter of 2023.\nVanadium Redox Flow Batteries continue to gain importance in the battery storage world, no loss of capacity over time, longer lifespan, cost effective and versatile, they offer a compelling alternative for static battery storage. Vanadium use in steel manufacturing is also increasing due to global implementation of new standards.\nIt is considered that the Airijoki Project in Northern Sweden, located in a well-established mining district that includes the largest ",

We intend to reinterpret the entire database in order to define resource and progress all necessary activities in the mine planning process.\nOf additional benefit, of course, is that our potential orebodies are sulphide in nature and thus far less complex and expensive to treat. Sulphides are in limited supply and new nickel supply will be from laterite resources, which are both complex and expensive.\"\nDrilling Programme and Results\nKendrick's maiden diamond drill programme at the Stormyra Ni-Cu-Co Deposit (see Kendrick's RNS dated: 31 January 2023) was completed on 1 March 2023, ahead of schedule and under budget.

Historic wide-spaced soil geochemistry had indicated the presence of copper mineralisation and the most recent study has highlighted the prospectivity of the Airijoki Project with the addition of copper-nickel- cobalt - gold - palladium anomalies and targets over and above the existing vanadium mineral resource and potential vanadium extensions.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFour new exploration targets identified outside the main Vanadium trend.\n\u00b7\nNew targets are anomalous for copper, nickel, cobalt, gold, and palladium and are coincident with underlying airborne geophysical anomalism.\n\u00b7\nTwo of the copper, Nickel, cobalt, gold, palladium targets have been prioritised for immediate follow-up once weather permits.\n\u00b7\nTwo targets have estimated minimum strike lengths of approximately 2km and 1km.\n\u00b7\nThe Airijoki licences remain highly prospective for vanadium.\nChairman of Kendrick Resources Colin Bird said \"The discovery of other targets for copper, gold, nickel, cobalt, and palladium within the suite of Airijoki licences is very encouraging particularly as the Project remains highly prospective for vanadium. Geophysics has proven successful at defining economic grades of vanadium mineralisation as evidenced by the 40Mt of Mineral Resource reported to date and, we have a number of kilometres of additional geophysical targets that will be drilled later this Year. The potential for the discovery of other metals raises the profile of the Airijoki project and offers scope for the future recovery of valuable by-products to complement vanadium production. We look forward to providing further updates and notifying shareholders of the commencement of drilling\".\nBackground to Geochemical Survey\nA geochemical soil sampling programme was initiated on the back of an observation that in the assays from the drilling of the vanadium resource at Airijoki, a number of other metals at elevated concentrations were observed to occur at random in the drill core and hence the need to explore the wider Airijoki area for other potential mineral occurrences.\nA geochemical sampling programme was carried out on four of Airijoki licenses in 2022 (license numbers 100, 101, 102 and 103), as a direct follow up and southern extension to the soil and rock sampling carried out in October 2021 on the Airijoki license number 200.\nThe geochemical soil sampling programme was carried out with profile lines roughly orientated northwest-southeast with a nominal profile spacing of 250 metres for the 100 licence, which covers the existing Vanadium JORC resource at Airijoki and 400m profile line spacing for the other licenses, which are at an earlier stage of exploration.\nA total of 523 samples were collected in 2022 and with the 128 samples collected in 2021 a total of 651 soil samples were analysed at ALS Pitea using their ionic leach method that is designed to enhance the most subtle labile geochemical anomalies for a wide range of commodities.\nA geochemical characterisation and targeting study on these assayed samples identified six different elemental assemblages that were considered as being anomalous. Of the six assemblages, two were considered to be false anomalies that did not conform to known geological/geophysical features.\nFigure: Airijoki Licences with Ionic Leach soil sampling results indicating Cu-Ni-Co and Au-pd anomalies and targets.\nThe known vanadium resource at Airijoki was not picked up by this study as vanadium is closely associated with magnetite, which is a resistant mineral that does not weather as easily and hence does not appear to have left an obvious geochemical signature is the soil samples assayed.\nOut of the remaining four anomalies, a Cu-Ni-Co-Mg assemblage that is also high in Au & Pd, orientated northwest-southeast, was identified in two areas (~2km and ~1km long respectively) and is considered to be a priority for follow up exploratory work.\nThe Airijoki Project\nThe\nAirijoki Project\nlies within the Vittangi Greenstone Group (VGG) of northern Sweden, in relative proximity to established infrastructure as well as several significant mines (i.e. Kiruna, Svapparvaara, Leve\u00e4niemi and Mertainen) and other new energy mineral projects (i.e. Talga Group's Vittangi graphite proj",

The first two batches of drill core have been dispatched for processing and assay with the third and final batch currently being prepared.\n\u00b7\nAfter receiving the assay results we will support the project with further technical studies targeted at completing a resource estimate update.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation was visible in drill core providing early confirmation of good continuity of the Stormyra ore body.\n\u00b7\nThe Project team is currently assessing several other nickel targets and anomalies within the Espedalen area for follow up.\nAirijoki V2O5 - Cu Project\n\u00b7\nResults and assessment of a soil and rock geochemical survey over the four licences held at admission is due late March / early April.\n\u00b7\nSoil and rock geochemical survey planned over the two new licenses granted in late 2022 is expected to commence in the summer.\n\u00b7\nSummer Drilling Programme:\nA drilling programme is being scheduled for the Second Quarter when access to the area is possible. The target of the drilling programme is the extension of the existing resource to significantly increase the existing JORC (2012) Mineral Resource of 44.3Mt @ 0.4% V2O5 (in-situ) containing 5.9Mt of magnetite averaging 1.7% V2O5 in concentrate, with a focus on highly prospective geophysical targets representing a northerly extension of the known vanadium mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nMetallurgical test work:\nExternal consultants are making good progress with metallurgical test work on Airijoki core samples.\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman of Kendrick Resources Plc, commented:\n\"The Espedalen Nickel drilling programme has progressed well. Our local team has interacted with the community, keeping interested parties informed and we plan to hold a further meeting once we are able to display drill core and corresponding assays. We have a number of highly prospective targets within the Espedalen area that require follow up and it is important that we assess as many of these as is practicable before deciding on the likely scale of any future operation. We also have several other nickel projects all located in central southern Norway that remain prospective.\nWe have been generating the necessary underlying geological data to complement the magnetic geophysical information in our possession to refine targets over the suite of licences comprising Airijoki. It is worth reminding shareholders that we have a total of 6 exploration licences of which only one has been drilled to date to generate the JORC (2012) Mineral Resource. Figure 3 is an image of the geophysics which shows, the same highly anomalous signature extends over the remaining 5 licences representing a large-scale opportunity to potentially increase the vanadium resource. The presence of copper also offers a potential saleable by-product. We hold the view that it is only a matter of time before vanadium battery technology becomes a mainstream feature of the Green Energy Transition. Scalable, safe bulk storage capacity of electricity will be required, and the unique characteristics of vanadium redox flow technology has the capacity to meet this future demand. The two largest producers of vanadium are China and Russia. Alternative sources of the metal located in safe reliable jurisdictions will be at a premium and as a result, Kendrick will continue to grow its' vanadium Mineral Resource and add value by working with downstream bulk storage companies\".\nFigure 1:\nDrill core showing Ni-Cu sulphide mineralisation and host rock lithologies\nFigure 2: Hole 12 Stormyra norite banding with 0.1 to 1.0% mixed sulphides, pyrrhotite, pyrite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite.\nFigure 3: Geophysics:\nAirijoki resources and\nlicence areas\nFurther information on the Company's projects can be found on the Company's website at:\nhttps://www.kendrickresources.com/\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\n-ENDS-\nFor additional information please contact:\nKendrick Resources Plc:\nChairman\nTel: +44 203 961 6086\nColin Bird\nNovum Securities\nTel: +44 7399 9400\nFinancial Adviser\nJoint Broker\nDavid Coffman / George Duxberry\nJon Bellis\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nJoint Broker\nTel: +44 207 186 9952\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\nQualified Person:\nThe technical information contained in this announcement has been r",

Applications will be made to the relevant local and regional authorities for permission to drill.\n\u00b7\nReview of geophysical data for the Sum\u00e5ssj\u00f6n Vanadium Project in Sweden has been authorised along with the purchase of historic geophysical data\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman commented\n\"I am particularly pleased by the investigations ongoing for nickel and feel there is much more potential than previously reported. We will be targeting drilling to extend the existing resource and to test new targets at Espedalen and elsewhere. I also remain convinced that vanadium will play a significant role in static energy storage in the near future and as a result we are pursuing our vanadium projects vigorously. We are analysing and working on the combination of historic and in-house generated raw data, executing further metallurgical test work and scheduling more drilling of known extensions to Airijoki all with a view to increasing our existing mineral resource.\"\nEspedalen Nickel\nThe Company engaged an independent consultant to re-log the drill core from the advanced stage Stormyra deposit (55 shallow holes;\nMeetings have been held with interested and affected parties in the area around Espedalen where drilling is planned and the Company has provided information relating to future exploration plans.\nIn addition to Stormyra, the Company has identified the Megrund prospect as a priority target for follow up with potential to host massive sulphides based on the Ni tenor being on par with Stormyra, together with the prospect having the highest PGE grades recorded at Espedalen.\nThe review also noted that several other prospects within the Espedalen Project area that had been tested with only 1 to 3 drillholes, all intersected nickel sulphide mineralisation. No follow-up was undertaken on these prospects and the Company intends to review the original geophysics results over these targets before deciding on further evaluation.\nThe process of selection of a drilling contractor is underway and the relevant local authority will be provided with documentation including a request to undertake drilling. Subject to drill rig availability, the proposal remains to drill in late January 2023 when ground conditions are considered optimal to limit damage to the local environment. The drill plan has been submitted to the Director of Mines, off road permits are being processed and meetings with the local landowners have been scheduled.\nAirijoki Vanadium - Copper\nAt the time of acquisition, the Airijoki Project in N Sweden comprised 4 exploration licences focused on vanadium mineralisation in the Vittangi greenstones. An Inferred mineral resource estimate has been calculated totalling\n44.3 Mt at an in situ grade of 0.4% V2O5, containing 5.9 Mt of magnetite averaging 1.7% V2O5 (in magnetite concentrate) for 100,800 t of contained V2O5 based on a 13.3% mass recovery of magnetite concentrate and a 0.7% V2O5 cut-off grade.\nA significant amount of historic geophysical survey data had been obtained that has been reinterpreted by Kendrick based on more recent assessment of the local geology.\nConsistent with this reinterpretation, the Company identified the potential for copper mineralisation in the same general geological setting as the vanadium resource and acquired two additional exploration licences deemed to be prospective based on available historic geochemistry and have embarked on a wide-ranging programme of soil sampling and detailed mapping across the 5 licences that make up the Project.\nIt is important to note that the abovementioned mineral resource estimate of 44.3Mt is confined to Licence Nr 100 and that the remaining 5 licences held by Kendrick host similar geochemical and geophysical sign",

Not only have we completed the groundwork that will see us expand existing vanadium resources, we have also identified a number of new and exciting opportunities such as the copper at Airijoki offering a value-add by-product to the metal inventory which is also the right metal in the right place. The scheduled metallurgical test work on Airijoki vanadium ore should enhance the feasibility of the Project and provide an opportunity to confirm that copper can also be recovered from future ore. Airijoki now represents a drill-ready opportunity to rapidly increase the vanadium mineral resource and to define the nature of recently identified widespread copper anomalism over an enlarged block of licences in a well-established mining district in a mining friendly jurisdiction\"\nFurther information on the Company's projects can be found on the Company's website at:\nhttps://www.kendrickresources.com/\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\n-ENDS-\nFor additional information please contact:\nKendrick Resources Plc:\nChairman\nTel: +44 203 961 6086\nColin Bird\nNovum Securities\nTel: +44 7399 9400\nFinancial Adviser\nJoint Broker\nDavid Coffman / George Duxberry\nJon Bellis\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nJoint Broker\nTel: +44 207 186 9952\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\nQualified Person:\nThe technical information contained in this announcement has been reviewed, verified, and approved by Colin Bird, CC.ENG, FIMMM, South African and UK Certified Mine Manager and Director of African Pioneer plc, with more than 40 years' experience mainly in hard rock mining.\nAbout Kendrick Resources Plc\nKendrick Resources Plc is a mineral exploration and development company with projects primarily based across Scandinavia.

The current work programme has been arranged to ensure continuous exploration and project advancement whilst accommodating local restrictions and requirements with reference to access and minimising the impact of exploration on the environment.\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"\nWe have now completed a full review of the projects within the Kendrick asset portfolio. What is pleasing is the amount of raw data that has been discovered that has not been digitised or included in previous project assessments. We have spent the period assessing, organising and interrogating the data which has allowed us to start the process of establishing resources for many of our projects and more importantly, building these resources consistent with today's metal prices and therefore establishing new cut-offs. The potential strength of our Norwegian nickel assets has emerged which in conjunction with the momentum being shown by projected nickel battery demand has made our nickel campaign a top priority. We are progressing on all fronts, and we are very pleased with the Airijoki Project where we have encountered significant copper anomalism across the suite of Airijoki licences. We expect to commence confirmation and extension drilling in Norway in the near future and will roll our further drilling campaigns in Sweden to coincide with Swedish legislation regarding the timing of seasonal drilling\".\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nNickel projects\n\u00b7\nAccess has been granted to the Norwegian National Drill Core and Sample Centre for the cutting and sampling of Stormyra Prospect previously unsampled core identified by the Company's external nickel consultant to be mineralised.\n\u00b7\nProvisional infill and expansion drill programme proposal has been produced for the Stormyra deposit\n\u00b7\nMeetings have been confirmed with local authorities around the Espedalen Licence (Stormyra deposit) to provide the Company with an opportunity to update the local government bodies on exploration plans in the region.\nVanadium - Copper projects\n\u00b7\nA 1 tonne metallurgical sample for the Airijoki Vanadium-copper project is being shipped to the United Kingdom for Low Intensity Magnetic Separation (\"LIMS\") test work at a recognised laboratory.\n\u00b7\nSoil geochemistry over the Airijoki vanadium - copper licences Airijoki nr 101 - 104 & Airijoki nr 200 has been completed and samples are to be dispatched for analysis.\n\u00b7\nDetailed soil and rock chip sampling is specifically targeting copper following the discovery of widespread copper anomalism across the Airijoki block of licences.

On 6 May 2022, Kendrick completed an Initial Public Offering (\"\nIPO\n\") on the Standard List of the London Stock Exchange and the acquisition of its projects in Sweden and Finland as well as an option over its projects in Norway (the \"\nProjects\n\"). This option was exercised on 16 May 2022, more details of which are provided in the Corporate Highlights section of this review. Following the IPO, the Group undertaken a thorough review of all its projects and licences and has made a number of local appointments to manage operations and completed a review of all available technical information.\nTechnical review of Projects:\nAfter the IPO and having acquired its projects in Sweden, Finland and exercised its option in relation to its Norwegian projects, the Company commenced technical reviews and / or programmes on its portfolio. The primary metal in the Swedish and Finnish projects is vanadium and nickel for the Norwegian projects.\nSummary of Projects:\nThe Projects are a portfolio of early to advanced stage exploration projects covering a combined area of 466.72 km2 in Scandinavia. The most advanced of these Projects are the Airijoki and Koitelainen vanadium projects in Sweden and Finland respectively. In addition the Company holds the following licences:\n\u00b7\nFinland - the Karhujupukka vanadium-magnetite exploration project\n\u00b7\nSweden - the Kramsta, Kullberget, Simesvallen and Sum\u00e5ssj\u00f6n exploration projects in Sweden (collectively the \"\nCentral Sweden Project\n\")\n\u00b7\nNorway - an option over the Espedalen, Hosanger, and Sigdal exploration nickel-copper-cobalt projects in Norway.\nBoth the Karhujupukka and Espedalen projects also support defined mineral resources prepared in accordance with the JORC Code (2012.) However, these remain subject to further techno-economic assessment. The remaining projects represent brownfield to greenfield exploration opportunities based on the results of historical activities, some with historical mineral estimates that are still to be updated to the requirements of the JORC Code (2012).\nNorway Projects:\nThe Company's review has identified significant opportunities within the nickel projects in Norway. The Director's believe this review and present nickel price forecasting means the Company is extremely well positioned with the Norwegian nickel assets. Kendrick is currently digitising and reassessing nickel ore resources, to direct future drilling programmes, towards early production. The nickel resources are demonstrating good grades and, in most cases, have accompanying copper and sometimes cobalt. It is intended that the Company will commence a strike extension drilling programme when the most prospective and amenable target has been identified.\nSwedish & Finnish Projects:\nThe Swedish vanadium project is being prepared for an extension drilling programme with the same intention for the ultramafic rock on the Finnish licences. In reviewing the Airijoki project significant copper anomalies have been identified and the occurrences for future testing are currently being modelled. All licences, where appropriate, have been applied for with copper included as an exploration target. Plans are being drafted for metallurgical test work in order to increase recoveries, whilst maintaining magnetite vanadium grade. The Company is preparing plans to conduct further test work to advance the processing to the end product vanadium electrolytes.\nFinancial Review\nFinancial highlights:\n\u00b7\n\u00a3185K loss after tax (2021: \u00a3169K)\n\u00b7\nApproximately \u00a32.173m cash at bank at the period end (Dec 2021: \u00a317k).\n\u00b7\nThe basic and diluted losses per share are summarised in the table below:\nLoss per share (pence)\n2022\n2021\nBasic\nNote 3\n(0.24)p\n(1.51)p\nDiluted\nNote 3\n(0.15)p\n(1.51)p\n\u00b7\nThe net asset value as at 30 June 2022 was\n\u00a3\n5.26m (31 December 2021 (\n\u00a3236k)\n)\nFundraisings and issues of shares\nAt Listing, the Company through a fundraise raised \u00a33,250,000 (before expenses) (the \"\nFundraise\n\") through the issue of 92,857,143 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") at 3.5 pence per Ordinary Share (the \"\nPlacing Price\n\") to the subscribers to the Fundraising (the \"\nPlacees\n\")\nand the issue of 91,000,143 warrants to the Placees with an exercise price of \u00a30.06 per Ordinary Share, exercisable for 3 years from Admission (the \"\nPlacing Warrants\n\")\nThe funds raised on Admission provided the Group w",

Below is the summary of the Company's findings. Subsequent focused studies have shone a positive light on the nickel assets, all of which show potential particularly as a significant amount of historic drilling, resource estimation and general exploration generated a database that had never been properly assimilated and processed. This database has now been recognised to have significant additional financial and technical potential. The Company has therefore re-ranked the nickel ahead of the vanadium projects based on the immediate opportunities that the nickel assets present to Kendrick.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nDetailed review of the Norwegian Espedalen Ni-Cu Project including the Stormyra, Megrund and Dalen prospects and the initiation of a resource estimation programme for the Project.\n\u00b7\nRelogging of the Stormyra Ni-Cu drillholes using an external recognised nickel expert has led to the discovery of previously unrecorded nickel mineralisation in drill core that could potentially result in wider zones of mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nRe-engagement and consultation with an engineering group to revisit a previous study for the design and high-level financial analysis of a bespoke processing plant capable of processing nickel ores mined at Espedalen and, subject to further evaluation, other nickel satellite projects located in central southern Norway in the Company's licence portfolio\n\u00b7\nSignificant copper anomalies identified at the Airijoki vanadium project that has warranted an expansion of historic soil geochemical surveys and the application for additional licences for copper.\n\u00b7\nDetailed review of the suite of vanadium licences in Sweden and Finland has confirmed and validated the findings of previous studies and the Company is developing an exploration plan to further assess potential.\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman, commented\n\"Since listing we have conducted an extensive review of all licences of asset potential to create a league table of opportunity aimed at today and the mid-term. That review led us to the conclusion that the nickel assets in Norway have immense potential in that they are sulphide and hold immediate opportunity for value add in the form of resource enhancement and mid-term mining. We are also conscious of the potential of PGE group metals and cobalt within the resource package. The Airijoki vanadium prospect is very exciting and extremely well located, with an unexpected bonus in the form of significant geochemical copper potential within and on the periphery of the licence. We intend to aggressively pursue the copper indication and have included these copper anomalies in our applications for further licences. The region is copper prolific, and I am excited about the potential of having two new age metals in the same licence. In Finland, we have confirmed previous vanadium work and are potentially pursuing a limited drilling programme, to test a VTEM geophysical anomaly generated between 2012-2014. This anomaly is barely tested and shows potential for nickel and vanadium.\nIn essence, our work has been directed to focus on short- and medium-term opportunities, whilst maintaining the overall integrity of the portfolio. Not unusually feet on the ground have identified new opportunities no\nt recognised during the early acquisition and financing stage. We are also strengthening our management team with the highly qualified and experienced individuals who will be able to advance the company in its Northern European endeavours\"\nNORWAY: Detailed Review\nThe company has carried out a detailed review of its Norwegian Nickel-Copper licenses, with a focus on the more advanced Espedalen license, where there has been a substantial amount of work carried out by previous license holders that includes 167 holes drilled leading to the delineation of ten targets.\nEspedalen - Relogging of Core and Discovery of Additional Mineralisation\nThe Company engaged an independent consultant to re-log the drill core from the advanced stage Stormyra deposit (55 shallow holes;\nEspedalen - Other Prospects\nIn addition to Stormyra, the Company has identified the Megrund prospect as a priority target for follow up with potential to host massive sulphides based on the Ni tenor being on par with Stormyra , together with the prospect having the highest PGE grades recorded at Espedalen.\nThe review also noted that several other prospects within the Espedalen Project area that had been tested with only ",

The historical Rare Earth values are higher than those generally reported in the industry and the high values of the magnetic elements are very encouraging since such elements are much sought after.\nThe licenses have areas which are drill ready and historically been well evaluated with geophysics and exploration fieldwork.\nWe intend to accelerate our due diligence and technical preparedness in order to release the high potential of the project area. We will keep shareholders advised as our evaluation phase develops.\"\nKey conditions of the Option Agreement\nThe period of the agreement is 120-days, concluding 19 May 2026, which can be extended by Bonya's sole election.\nKendrick may, at any time during the 120-day period, give notice to exercise the option and enter into a definitive agreement to be negotiated.\nShould Kendrick advise Bonya that it has no intention to exercise the option, neither party has any obligation towards the other party.\nThe parties agree that there can be no termination by either party during the option period, other than Kendrick advising Bonya it does not wish to continue for any reason.\nFor further information, please\ncontact:\nKendrick Resources Plc:\nChairman\nTel: +44 2039 616\n086\nColin\nBird\nAlbR Capital Limited\nFinancial Adviser and Joint Broker\nTel: +44 207 469 0930\nDavid Coffman / Dan Harris\nJon Bellis\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nJoint Broker\nTel: +44 207 186\n9952\nDamon Heath / Isabella\nPierre\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Certainly not expecting to recover anything like the +\u00a322k losses currently incurred. You can't help wondering if a  \"take it private\" stitch up will come in just prior to a stonking RNS, finally killing off any hopes LTHs may have had.

The Convertible Loan Facility is convertible, at the Convertible Conversion price save that if prior to repayment there is a 'Qualifying Financing', being any issue of new shares for cash at less than the Convertible Conversion Price the loan will convert at the price and on the same terms as the relevant 'Qualifying Financing'. The agreement includes customary terms and conditions for a facility of this nature.\nRelated Party Transaction - Convertible Loan Facility\nColin Bird is a director of the Company, so a related party for the purposes of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (\"DTRs\"), the participation by Colin Bird in the Convertible Loan Facility constitutes a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3 as it is for more than 5% of the aggregate amount of the Convertible Loan Facility and the Additional Loan Tranche (the \"\nRelated Party Transaction\n\"). Colin Bird's participation in the Convertible Loan Facility is on the same terms as the other Lenders and provides additional capital for the group's operations, accordingly the independent directors, being Marytn Churchouse, Alex Borrelli, Kjeld Thygesen and Evan Kirby, consider Colin Bird's participation in the Convertible Loan Facility to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nSanderson Facility\nThe terms of the\n\u00a3375,000 drawn down under the pre-existing Sanderson Facility remain the same save that the maturity date has been extended to 30 June 2027.\u00a0The Additional Loan Tranche terms are as follows:\nRepayment and Conversion\nRepayment\nUnless otherwise converted, the Company must repay the Additional Loan Tranche on 31 January 2027 (the\n\"Repayment Date\")\n. The Company may prepay the whole or part of the Facility on any day prior to the Repayment Date upon giving not less than 14 days' prior written notice to the Lender and paying in cash a prepayment fee of 5% of the amount which the Company prepays in cash before the Repayment Date. SCP can during the 14 days' notice period make an election for all or part of the loan subject to a prepayment notice to be repaid in new ordinary shares (\"\nShares\")\nin which case the 5% fee shall not apply to that proportion of the loan repaid in Shares.\nConversion of Loan Tranche by Lender\nSCP may at any time prior to the Repayment Date elect to convert all or part of any drawn down amount into such number of Shares equal to the amount of the Additional Loan Tranche that is to be repaid at the date of the election, divided by the Convertible Conversion price, If prior to repayment of the Additional Loan Tranche there is a 'Qualifying Financing', being any issue of Shares for cash at less than the Convertible Conversion Price, then the Additional Loan Tranche's conversion price will be at the price and on the same terms as the relevant 'Qualifying Financing'\nConversion of Loan by the Company\nThe Company may at any time prior to the Repayment Date elect to convert all or part of Additional Loan Tranche if the Share price exceeds 1.336 pence (\"\nTarget Conversion Price\n\") for a period of five or more business ",
