The Convertible Loan Facility is convertible, at the Convertible Conversion price save that if prior to repayment there is a 'Qualifying Financing', being any issue of new shares for cash at less than the Convertible Conversion Price the loan will convert at the price and on the same terms as the relevant 'Qualifying Financing'. The agreement includes customary terms and conditions for a facility of this nature.\nRelated Party Transaction - Convertible Loan Facility\nColin Bird is a director of the Company, so a related party for the purposes of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (\"DTRs\"), the participation by Colin Bird in the Convertible Loan Facility constitutes a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3 as it is for more than 5% of the aggregate amount of the Convertible Loan Facility and the Additional Loan Tranche (the \"\nRelated Party Transaction\n\"). Colin Bird's participation in the Convertible Loan Facility is on the same terms as the other Lenders and provides additional capital for the group's operations, accordingly the independent directors, being Marytn Churchouse, Alex Borrelli, Kjeld Thygesen and Evan Kirby, consider Colin Bird's participation in the Convertible Loan Facility to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nSanderson Facility\nThe terms of the\n\u00a3375,000 drawn down under the pre-existing Sanderson Facility remain the same save that the maturity date has been extended to 30 June 2027.\u00a0The Additional Loan Tranche terms are as follows:\nRepayment and Conversion\nRepayment\nUnless otherwise converted, the Company must repay the Additional Loan Tranche on 31 January 2027 (the\n\"Repayment Date\")\n. The Company may prepay the whole or part of the Facility on any day prior to the Repayment Date upon giving not less than 14 days' prior written notice to the Lender and paying in cash a prepayment fee of 5% of the amount which the Company prepays in cash before the Repayment Date. SCP can during the 14 days' notice period make an election for all or part of the loan subject to a prepayment notice to be repaid in new ordinary shares (\"\nShares\")\nin which case the 5% fee shall not apply to that proportion of the loan repaid in Shares.\nConversion of Loan Tranche by Lender\nSCP may at any time prior to the Repayment Date elect to convert all or part of any drawn down amount into such number of Shares equal to the amount of the Additional Loan Tranche that is to be repaid at the date of the election, divided by the Convertible Conversion price, If prior to repayment of the Additional Loan Tranche there is a 'Qualifying Financing', being any issue of Shares for cash at less than the Convertible Conversion Price, then the Additional Loan Tranche's conversion price will be at the price and on the same terms as the relevant 'Qualifying Financing'\nConversion of Loan by the Company\nThe Company may at any time prior to the Repayment Date elect to convert all or part of Additional Loan Tranche if the Share price exceeds 1.336 pence (\"\nTarget Conversion Price\n\") for a period of five or more business days.\nInterest and Fees\nThe Additional Loan Tranche is interest free.

The historical Rare Earth values are higher than those generally reported in the industry and the high values of the magnetic elements are very encouraging since such elements are much sought after.\nThe licenses have areas which are drill ready and historically been well evaluated with geophysics and exploration fieldwork.\nWe intend to accelerate our due diligence and technical preparedness in order to release the high potential of the project area. We will keep shareholders advised as our evaluation phase develops.\"\nKey conditions of the Option Agreement\nThe period of the agreement is 120-days, concluding 19 May 2026, which can be extended by Bonya's sole election.\nKendrick may, at any time during the 120-day period, give notice to exercise the option and enter into a definitive agreement to be negotiated.\nShould Kendrick advise Bonya that it has no intention to exercise the option, neither party has any obligation towards the other party.\nThe parties agree that there can be no termination by either party during the option period, other than Kendrick advising Bonya it does not wish to continue for any reason.\nFor further information, please\ncontact:\nKendrick Resources Plc:\nChairman\nTel: +44 2039 616\n086\nColin\nBird\nAlbR Capital Limited\nFinancial Adviser and Joint Broker\nTel: +44 207 469 0930\nDavid Coffman / Dan Harris\nJon Bellis\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nJoint Broker\nTel: +44 207 186\n9952\nDamon Heath / Isabella\nPierre\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
