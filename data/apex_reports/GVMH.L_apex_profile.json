The Company raised \u00a3769,500 before expenses.\nThe Company identified a potential target business to acquire, and due diligence on the target commenced in\nFebruary 2017\n.\nThe loss for the period was \u00a3277,000 [2016 : loss of \u00a3101,000], which was primarily as a result of the due diligence costs relating to the acquisition.\nCash in hand was \u00a3264,000 at the year end [2016 : \u00a360,000].\nOutlook\nThe Company is progressing the acquisition and hopes that this will conclude in the near term, at which point the newly enlarged Company\u2019s shares will resume trading on the Main Market.\nPrincipal activity and fair review of the business\nThe company was incorporated on\n26 February 2016\n.\nThe Company has been formed for the purpose of acquiring a company or business. The Company has identified a target acquisition and the Company expects that any funds not used in connection with the Acquisition will be used for future acquisitions, internal or external growth and expansion, and working capital in relation to the acquired company or business.\nThe Company is currently undertaking an acquisition that, if successful, will result in a reverse takeover (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d). Following completion of the Acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the acquisition.\nThe trading results for the period ended\n31 December 2017\n, and the financial position at the end of the period are shown in the audited financial statements. The profit and loss account for the period shows a loss before tax of \u00a3277,000.\nKey Performance indicators\nThere are no key performance indicators for this period as the company has not completed its investment activity.\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nBusiness Strategy\nThe company is a newly formed entity with no operating history and has not yet completed an acquisition.\nThe company may acquire either less than whole voting control of, or less than a controlling equity interest in, a target, which may limit its operational strategies.\nThe company may be unable to complete the Acquisition in a timely manner or at all or to fund the operations of the target business if it does not obtain additional funding following completion of the acquisition.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Directors have reviewed the working capital requirements and believe that there is sufficient working capital to fund the business.\nFinance\nThe Company continues with the Acquisition and has sufficient funds in hand to conclude the transaction. The Company is seeking to raise further finance at the time of completion to provide adequate funds to grow the target business post acquisition\n.\nFuture developments and acquisition strategy\nThe Company has a target acquisition under contemplation. The Company\u2019s efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, but the Directors intend to focus on the technology, media and telecommunications sectors primarily in\nEurope\nand\nAsia\n, but will also consider investments in other geographical regions, given their experience in these areas. The Directors believe that these sectors offer good growth opportunities currently, and there are various opportunities within these sectors that can enhance shareholder value in the long run. The Directors intend to focus on specific areas within these sectors that have a new technology and/or internet aspect to the business, which might differentiate the business and offer above average growth prospects.\nGoing Concern\nThe day to day working capital requirements and investment objectives are met by existing cash resources and the issue of equity. At\n31 December 2017\nthe company had a cash balance of \u00a3264,000. The company\u2019s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in the level of overhead costs, show that the company should be able to o"

The prospectus is available on the Company's current website,\nhttp://www.simianglobal.com\n, and from its registered address at Finsgate, 5-7 Cranwood Street,\nLondon\n, EC1V 9EE. A copy of the prospectus has also been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism.\nThe Company announced on\n17 February 2018\nthat it had conditionally agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of GVCHL, the consideration for which is an aggregate value of the Pound Sterling equivalent of approximately\n$16 million\nto be satisfied by the issue and allotment of Ordinary Shares in Simian. The acquisition is conditional, inter alia, upon Admission and should it complete, the enlarged group will become engaged in business that (a) provides 3D digital panels that do not require glasses to be installed within cinema complexes, offering advertisers access to the growing number of cinemagoers in\nChina\n, and (b) develops and manages out-of-home media networks and provides integrated marketing services.\nThe purpose of the prospectus, which has been posted to shareholders of Simian, is to explain the background to and reasons for the Acquisition, which is in line with the Company\u2019s strategy. The Acquisition, if completed, will constitute a Reverse Takeover under the Listing Rules because of the size of GVCHL in relation to that of the Company and the fact that it will give rise to a fundamental change to the business, board composition and voting control of the Company resulting in the Company becoming an operating company. The Company indicated in its Original Prospectus that it would seek shareholder approval for a Reverse Takeover despite this not being a specific requirement of the Listing Rules.\nShareholder approval is also required under the Takeover Code to approve a Waiver of Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (\u201cthe Code Waiver\u201d). This is explained in detail in the prospectus.\nAccordingly, a General Meeting of the Company is being convened at which resolutions will be proposed, inter alia, to approve the Acquisition, the issue and allotment of the consideration shares, the placing shares and success fee shares, the issue and allotment of option shares, the Code Waiver and the change of the Company\u2019s name. The Resolutions are set out in full in the notice of General Meeting which has been dispatched to all shareholders. An electronic copy of the notice is also available on the Company's website\nhttp://simianglobal.com/investor-relations/circular-to-shareholders/\n.\nThe General Meeting will be held at\n11.00 a.m.\non\n18 June 2018\nat Finsgate, 5-7 Cranwood Street,\nLondon\n, EC1V 9EE.\nFor more information:\nSimian Global Plc\nwww.simianglobal.com\nEdward Kwan-Mang Ng, Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7866 2145 or info@simianglobal.com\nAlfred Henry Corporate Finance Ltd\nJon Isaacs or Nick Michaels\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3772 0021 or jisaacs@alfredhenry.com"
