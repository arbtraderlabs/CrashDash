The anticipated recovery of tourism was below market expectations and adversely affected by the global political situation.\nLocal consumer expenditure was also impacted by the growing trend of\nHong Kong\nconsumers going to the\nGreater China\nregion with a lower cost and better variety of products.\nSummary of Trading Results\nTotal revenue for the year was\nHK$3,431K\n(2023:\nHK$5,962K\n), a decline of 42% compared to the prior year. The total comprehensive loss for the year was\nHK$6,201K\n(2023:\nHK$5,120K\n). Our focus remains tight cost control to minimise operational costs and generate the new business income stream wherever possible.\nCash in hand at the end of the year was\nHK$11K\n. The Group continues to manage its cash within its available resources and the continued support from shareholders from time to time.\nOutlook\nThe economy and market conditions are increasingly volatile.\nHowever, we intend to stay focus on our core strategy of providing solutions and services in marketing and cross border e-commerce. We also intend to explore new business areas including brokering and facilitating deals via our extensive international network. We intend to re-finance the Group through shareholder loans which provides adequate working capital and also provide funding for potential new business streams.\nSection 172 Statement\nThe Directors are well aware of their duty under s172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole and, in doing so, to have regard (amongst other matters) to:\n\u2022 the likely consequences of any decision in the long term;\n\u2022 the interests of the Group\u2019s employees;\n\u2022 the need to foster the Group\u2019s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;\n\u2022 the impact of the Group\u2019s operations on the community and the environment;\n\u2022 the desirability of the Group maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and\n\u2022 the need to act fairly between members of the Group.\nThe Board recognises that the long-term success of the Grand Vision Media Holdings Group requires positive interaction with its stakeholders. Positive engagement with stakeholders will enable our stakeholders to better understand the activities, needs and challenges of the business and enable the Board to better understand and address relevant stakeholder views which will assist the Board\u2019s in its decision making and to discharge its duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.\nIn the following section we identify our key stakeholders, how we engage with them and key activities we have undertaken during the period in question.\nOur Shareholders\nThe Company has been well-supported by its shareholders for many years, who have provided shareholder loans historically, and during 2020, some shareholders participated in the convertible loan note issue. The Company endeavours to keep shareholders updated on regulatory matters, and is committed to provide transparent information to them, both through the annual report and ad-hoc communications.\nOur Customers\nThe Company strives to maintain strong relationships with its customers, which will promote long term growth. The relationships with customers who advertise with the Company are maintained through regular contact and relationship management.\nOur Employees\nThe Company believes that good staff morale engenders increased efficiency and loyalty, and hence promotes staff welfare and well-being. Staff needs are constantly monitored and improved on an ongoing basis.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Directors consider the following risk factors to be of relevance to the Group\u2019s activities. It should be noted that the list is not exhaustive and that other risk factors not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may apply. The risk factors are summarised below:\nDevelopment Risk\nThe Group\u2019s development will be, in part, dependent on the ability of the Directors to continue to expand the current business and identify suitable investment opportunities and to implement the Group\u2019s strategy. There is no assurance that the Group will be successful in the expansion of the business, which is dependent on raising sufficient capital.\nSector Risk\nAs the Group operates in the media sector, it is more susceptible to economic downturns and times of uncertainty, as companies will cut marketing budgets before other expenses. Changing technologies and customer requirements means that the Group needs to be innovative with its media offerings, and adapt to market conditions rapidly.\nPolitical and Regulatory Risk\nThe\nGroup is subject to amendments to laws imposed by\nChina\nand by other jurisdictions where the Group does business, including laws that govern the time, place and manner of advertising, that may impair or even prevent the Group from conducting its business.\nFurthermore, prior to distributing advertisements for certain commodities, advertising distributors and advertisers are obligated to ensure compliance to relevant regulations.\nViolation of these regulations may result in penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements.\nIn circumstances involving serious violations, the SAIC or its local branches may revoke violators\u2019 licenses or permits for advertising business operations. In addition, advertisers, advertising operators or advertising distributors may be subject to civil liability if they infringe on the legal rights and interests of third parties in the course of their advertising business. The\nGroup has implemented procedures to ensure the content of our advertisement are properly reviewed and the advertisement would only be published upon the receipt of content approval from the relevant administrative authorities. However, the Group can provide no assurance that all the content of the advertisements is true and in full compliance with applicable laws.\nIn the event that the\nGroup was in violation of such regulations the business, financial condition, results of operations and the prospects of the\nGroup could be materially and adversely affected.\nEnvironmental Risks and Hazards\nAll phases of the Group\u2019s operations are subject to environmental regulation in the areas in which it operates. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees.\nThere is no assurance that existing or future environmental regulation will not materially adversely affect the Group\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties on which the Group holds interests that are unknown to the Group at present. The Board manages this risk by working with environmental consultants and by engaging with the relevant governmental departments and other concerned stakeholders.\nInternal Control and Financial Risk Management\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the Group\u2019s systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Group maintains systems which are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material loss and to manage rather than eliminate risk.\nThe key features of the Group\u2019s systems of internal control are as follows:\nManagement structure with clearly identified responsibilities;\nProduction of timely and comprehensive historical management information presented to the Board;\nDetailed budgeting and forecasting;\nDay to day hands on involvement of the Executive Directors and Senior Management; and\nRegular board and meetings and discussions with the Non-executive directors.\nThe Group\u2019s activities expose it to several financial risks including cash flow risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.\nEnvironmental Policy\nThe Group is aware of the potential impact that its subsidiary and associate companies may have on the environment. The Group ensures that it complies with all local regulatory requirements and seeks to implement a best practice approach to managing environmental aspects.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Group\u2019s aim is to achieve and maintain a high standard of workplace safety. In order to achieve this objective, the Group provides ongoing training and support to employees and sets demanding standards for workplace safety.\nFinancing Risk\nThe development of the Group\u2019s business will depend upon the Group\u2019s ability to obtain financing primarily through the raising of new equity capital or debt. The Group\u2019s ability to raise further funds may be affected by the success of existing and acquired investments. The Group may not be successful in procuring the requisite funds on terms which are acceptable to it (or at all) and, if such funding is unavailable, the Group may be required to reduce the scope of its investments or the anticipated expansion. Further, Shareholders\u2019 holdings of Ordinary Shares may be materially diluted if debt financing is not available.\nCredit Risk\nThe Group does not have bank loans or other borrowings except for shareholder loans.\nThe Group has benefitted from further shareholder loans, although there is no guarantee that these will continue in the future. We have reviewed the accounts receivable and have made adequate provisions as appropriate.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Directors have reviewed the working capital forecasts for the Group and believe that there is sufficient working capital with additional financing expected to be raised from the shareholders (as and when required) to fund the business as it progresses to break even. The group is reliant on raising new capital for expansion, which is not guaranteed.\nMarket Risk\nThe group\u2019s investments is in its subsidiary, GVC Holdings Ltd. The shares are not readily tradable.\nCapital Risk\nThe Group manages its capital resources to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, while maximising shareholder return.\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to shareholders, comprising issued share capital and reserves. The availability of new capital will depend on many factors including a positive operating environment, positive stock market conditions, the Group\u2019s track record, and the experience of management. There are no externally imposed capital requirements.\nThe Directors are confident that adequate cash resources will be made available to finance operations but controls over expenditure are carefully managed.\nEnvironmental, social and governance\nA review of the Group\u2019s approach to sustainability and societal impact during the year is set out below:\nClimate Change\nThe Group recognise the increasing importance of climate change triggered by greenhouse gases (GHG) from burning fossil fuels.\nWe plan to publish targets across 2024/2025. We have made progress in reducing emissions in our offices during 2024, the majority of our employees return as normal to work in office. Total GHG emissions associated with activities under direct control of management (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) remained at the same level in 2024 versus 2023. In terms of Energy efficiency, our energy usage was on the same level in 2024 compared with 2023.\nEnvironmental\nThe Group\u2019s operations are conducted in such a manner that compliance is maintained with legal requirements relating to the environment in areas where the Group conducts its business. During the period covered by this report, the Group has not incurred any fines or penalties or been investigated for any breach of environmental regulations.\nThe Directors consider that, due to the nature of the Group\u2019s operations. It does not have a significant impact on the environment. However, the Group seeks to minimise its carbon impact and recognises that its activities should be carried out in an environmentally friendly manner where practicable. The Group\u2019s environmental impact is under continual review and the Group considers related initiatives on an ongoing basis. In 2024, these included: continued reduction of waste and, where practicable, re-use and recycling of consumables; continued reduction of usage of energy, water and other resources; on-going upgrades to LED lighting; and reprogramming of certain air conditioning and air handling systems to increase efficiency and implement timed shutdowns when not required.\nFacilities and Office Environments\nManagement engages with its office provider and its facilities management provider to ensure a safe working environment for our employees.\nEnvironmental management is overseen by the Chief Executive Officer. Grand Vision Media Group complies with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013. We are also reporting in compliance with the Companies (Directors\u2019 Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 known as SECR (Streamlined Energy Carbon Reporting). Energy consumption and GHG emissions have been calculated in line with the UK Government\u2019s Environmental Reporting Guidelines; including streamlined energy and carbon reporting guidance (\nMarch 2019\n). There were no prosecutions or compliance notices for breaches of environmental legislation during 2024.\nThe Group\u2019s energy consumption within the UK has not exceeded 40,000 kilowatt-hours (kwh) of energy during the current year and hence exempt from reporting requirements under these regulations.\nSupply Chain\nWe are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. We maintain strong working relationships with our suppliers and partners, in order to enhance the efficiency of our business and create value, and make sure we treat suppliers in line with our values and ethical standards. We continually assess our supplier and partner network, and leverage both internal and external expertise to ensure appropriate relationships and fair economics.\nGovernance\nThe Board takes issues of governance seriously and seeks to ensure transparency and streamlined administration. The Directors bring a broad range of technical, commercial, business, accounting, audit and corporate finance expertise. Culturally, the Board demonstrates a high degree of integrity, fairness and non-discrimination and promotes these values through the organisation.\nGoing Concern\nThe Group incurred a loss of\nHKD6,638k\nfor the year ended\n31 December 2024\n(2023: loss of\nHKD3,982k\n) and was in a net liability position of\nHKD51,653k\nas at that date (2023:\nHKD45,452k\n). These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s and the Parent Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe day to day working capital requirements and investment objectives is met by cash from operations and shareholder loans. At\n31 December 2024\nthe Group had cash balance of\nHKD11k\n. The Group\u2019s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in the level of overhead costs, show that the company should be able to operate using cash from operations and with additional funding from its shareholders (as and when required). The directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, consider that the Group has adequate resources and, with the expected support of its shareholders, will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nOn behalf of the board\nJonathan Lo\nChief Executive Officer\n27 September 2025\nDIRECTORS' REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED\n31 DECEMBER 2024\nThe directors present their report together with the accounts of Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc (\u2018\u2019the Company\u2019\u2019, \u201cGVMH\u201d) and its subsidiary undertakings (together \u2018\nthe group\n\u2019, \u2018GVMH PLC\u2019) for the year ended\n31 December 2024\n.\nResults and dividends\nThe trading results for the Group are set out in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of financial position at the end\nof the year.\nThe directors have not recommended a dividend.\nDirectors\nThe following directors have held office during the period:\nAjay Kumar RAJPAL l\nJonathan Yat Pang LO\nFrederick Oon Kian CHUA\nDirectors\u2019 interests\nAt the date of this report the directors held the following beneficial interest in the ordinary share capital and share options of the company:\nDirector\nBeneficial Shareholding\nPercentage of the Company\u2019s ordinary Share Capital\nJonathan Yat Pang Lo\n22,438,842\n23.3%\nNone of directors held share options as at date of this report\nSubstantial Interests\nThe Company has been informed of the following shareholdings that represent 3% or more of the issued ordinary shares of the company as at\n31 December 2024\n.

A resolution for the reappointment Johnsons Financial Management Ltd as audit of the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.\nStatement of directors' responsibilities\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company and of the group\u2019s profit or loss for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\nmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\nstate whether they have been prepared in with accordance UK adopted International Accounting Standards\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and company will continue in business.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company\u2019s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company\u2019s website.\nCorporate Governance\nThe Board recognizes that good standards of corporate governance help the Company to achieve its strategic goals and is vital for the success of the Company.\nThe Company adopts proper standards of corporate governance and follows the principles of best practice set out in QCA Corporate Governance Code (2023), as far as is appropriate for the size and nature of the Company and the Group.\nThe QCA Code has ten principles of corporate governance that the Company has committed to apply within the foundations of the business. These principles are:\n1. Establish a strategy and business model which promote long-term value for shareholders;\n2. Seek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations;\n3. Take into account wider stakeholder and social responsibilities and their implications for long tern success;\n4. Embed effective risk management, considering both opportunities and threats, throughout the organisation;\n5. Maintain the board as a well-functioning balanced team led by the Chair;\n6. Ensure that between them the directors have the necessary up to date experience, skills and capabilities;\n7. Evaluate board performance based on clear and relevant objectives, seeking continuous improvement;\n8. Promote a corporate culture that is based on ethical values and behaviours;\n9. Maintain governance structures and processes that are fit for purpose and support good decision-making by the Board; and\n10. Communicate how the Company is governed and is performing by maintaining a dialogue with shareholders and other relevant stakeholders.\nThere follows a short explanation of how the Company applies each of the principles.\nPrinciple 1 \u2013 Business Model and Strategy\nGrand Vision Media Holdings Plc is a\nHong Kong\nbased out-of-home media (OOH) and digital marketing company. The Company completed a reverse takeover of GVC Holdings Limited in 2018. The OOH business focusses on innovative visual technologies in cinema spaces, with a view to broaden the technologies and locations. The partnerships with cinema groups across\nChina\nprovide a strong platform for the development and growth in business opportunities. The digital marketing business has well established clients and uses common digital platforms across the\nAsia\nregion. For further information on the market, the future strategy of the Company and the risks the Board consider to be the most significant for potential investors, Shareholders are referred to Strategic Report in the latest Annual Report and Accounts (which is available on our website).\nPrinciple 2 \u2013 Understanding Shareholders\u2018 Needs and Expectations\nCommunication with shareholders is co-ordinated and led between the CEO who is the Company\u2019s principal spokesperson with investors and other interested parties. The Company is in dialogue with, and holds meetings with, shareholders and brokers representing private shareholders as required, providing them with such information on the Company\u2019s progress as is permitted MAR and requirements of relevant legislation. The Company regularly updates its website and releases news flow and operational updates. Communications are also provided through the Company\u2019s Annual and Interim Reports. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting, which the Board believes is a good opportunity to communicate directly with shareholders. The Company discloses contact details on its website and on all announcements released via RNS, should shareholders wish to communicate with the Board.\nPrinciple 3 \u2013 Consider Wider Stakeholder and Social Responsibilities\nThe Board believes that its stakeholders (other than shareholders) are its employees, customers, suppliers and their funders. The Board recognises that the long-term success of the Company is reliant upon the efforts of the Company, advisers and these stakeholders. The Board makes every effort to communicate effectively with all stakeholders, to ensure that the Company complies with contractual terms.\nPrinciple 4 \u2013 Risk Management\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Company\u2019s risk management objectives and policies and recognises the need for an effective and well-defined risk management process. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Company\u2019s competitiveness and flexibility. The Board is responsible for the monitoring of financial performance against budget and forecast and the formulation of the Company\u2019s risk appetite including the identification, assessment and monitoring of the Company\u2019s principal risks. For further information on the risks the Board consider to be the most significant for potential investors, Shareholders are referred to the Strategic and Directors\u2019 Report contained in the latest Report and Accounts which are available on the Company\u2019s website.\nPrinciple 5 \u2013 A Well-functioning Board of Directors\nThe Board is responsible for the management of the business of the Company, setting the strategic direction of the Company and establishing the policies of the Company. It is the Board\u2019s responsibility to oversee the financial position of the Company and monitor the business and affairs of the Company on behalf of Shareholders, to whom the Directors are accountable. The primary duty of the Board is to act in the best interests of the Company at all times. The Board also addresses issues relating to internal control and the Company\u2019s approach to risk management. The Board consists of one Executive Director and two Non-Executive Directors, both of whom are considered to be independent.\nAll the Directors are expected to devote as much time to the affairs of the Company as may be necessary to fulfil their roles.\nJonathan Lo\nis CEO of the Board, and acts as Chairman for meetings. The CEO has industry and technical knowledge and financial expertise.\nThe Non-Executive Directors have accounting, fund management, technical, public market experience.\nAt formal meetings, the Board receives reports by the CEO on the overall performance since the previous Board meeting. He is supported by the subsidiary financial controller on financial detail. They are followed by reports on other matters, particularly progress with development projects. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board. This includes the setting of high-level targets, approval of budgets, strategy, funding, capital expenditure, license agreements and incentive schemes. Specific authority levels for expenditure are delegated to individual executives or management committees according to a schedule agreed by the Board.\nWhilst the bulk of the formulation of budgets and strategy is undertaken by senior management, this is done against a framework set by the whole Board, challenged by it in detail and finally approved by it. Financial information submitted regularly to the Board includes monthly balance sheets and profit & loss accounts; together with analyses of movements in cash, trade debtors and creditors, and fixed assets.\nCertain other high level decisions that cannot await the convening of a formal Board meeting may be agreed by way of written resolutions. In such cases supporting papers are submitted to the directors and they are given the opportunity to discuss the matter with other directors and executive management. Written resolutions are deemed passed only if all directors vote in favour.\nThe Board is conscious of the need to overcome the difficulties that can arise from the time differences and geographic separations that face directors; both between and within regions. It is not practical or cost-justified for the whole Board to meet face-to-face at every board meeting. So where one or more director is unable to be physically present, use is made of telephone conference calls.\nPrinciple 6 \u2013 Appropriate Skills and Experience of the Directors\nThe Company believes that the current balance of skills within the Board as a whole reflects a broad and appropriate range of commercial, technical and professional skills relevant to the business. Biographical details of each of the Directors and officers are set out below:\nJonathan Yat Pang Lo\nChief Executive Officer\nJonathan Yat Pang Lo\n, FCA, is the founder and CEO of GVC Holdings Ltd.

The Directors have access to the Company\u2019s external advisers e.g. lawyers and auditors as and when required and are able to obtain advice from other external advisers when necessary. All Directors have access to independent legal advice at the Company\u2019s expense. The Board will seek to take into account Board imbalances for future nominations, with areas to take into account including gender balance.\nPrinciple 7 \u2013 Evaluation of Board Performance\nEvaluation of the performance of the Company\u2019s Board has historically been implemented in an informal manner. The Board will formally review and consider the performance of each director at or around the time of publication of the company\u2019s annual report. On an ongoing basis, board members maintain a watching brief to identify relevant internal and external candidates who may be suitable additions to or backup for current board members. The Company undertakes annual monitoring of personal and corporate performance. Responsibility for assessing and monitoring the performance of the executive directors lies with the independent non-executive director. Agreed personal objectives and targets including financial and non-financial metrics are set each year for the executive directors and performance measured against these metrics. The Board as a whole is mindful of the need for considering succession planning.\nPrinciple 8 \u2013 Corporate Culture\nThe Board believes that the promotion a corporate culture based on sound ethical values and behaviours is essential to maximise shareholder value in the medium to long-term.\nThe Company recognises the importance of promoting an ethical corporate culture, interacting responsibly with all stakeholders and the communities in which the Company operates. The Company maintains and annually reviews a handbook that includes clear guidance on what is expected of every employee and officer of the company.\nAdherence of these standards is a key factor in the evaluation of performance within the company, including during annual performance reviews. Guided by the Group\u2019s core values of simplicity, empowerment, passion, innovation and authenticity, the Group seeks to promote a culture where its people can thrive. For GVMH, this means promoting strong business ethics and putting in place policies and programmes to build trust with employees. As a first priority, GVMH seeks to uphold individual human rights in its operations and expects the same from all partners. The Group\u2019s policies outline the behaviours expected from employees and suppliers at all times and set out the Group\u2019s zero tolerance approach towards any form of modern slavery, discrimination or unethical behaviour relating to bribery, corruption or business conduct. The GVMH diversity policy outlines the Group\u2019s commitment to building an inclusive culture, where people feel able to be their best at work, irrespective of age, race, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or gender.\nPrinciple 9 \u2013 Maintenance of Governance Structures and Processes\nThe Board provides strategic leadership for the Company and operates within the scope of a robust corporate governance framework. Its purpose is to ensure the delivery of long-term shareholder value, which involves setting the culture, values and practices that operate throughout the business, and defining the strategic goals that the Company implements in its business plans. The Board meets regularly to determine the policy and business strategy of the Group and has adopted a schedule of matters that are reserved as the responsibility of the Board. The CEO leads the development of business strategies within the Group\u2019s operations. The Board currently consists of one Executive Directors and two Non-executive Directors. The Board considers that there is an appropriate balance between the Executives and Non-executives and that no individual or small group dominates the Board\u2019s decision making.\nThe Board\u2019s members have a wide range of expertise and experience and it is felt that concerns may be addressed to the Non-executive Directors. The Board has considered mechanisms by which the business and the financial risks facing the Company are managed and reported to the Board. The principal business and financial risks have been identified and control procedures implemented. The Board acknowledges its responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the systems that are in place to manage risk and to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance with regard to the safeguarding of the Company\u2019s assets against misstatement or loss.\nInternal controls:\nThe Board has ultimate responsibility for the Company\u2019s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, any such system of internal control can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board considers that the internal controls in place are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the Group. The principal elements of the Group\u2019s internal control system include:\n\u2022 Close management of the day to day activities of the Group by the executive Directors;\n\u2022 An organisational structure with defined levels of responsibility, which promotes entrepreneurial decision making and rapid implementation whilst minimising risks;\n\u2022\nA comprehensive annual budgeting process producing a detailed integrated profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow, which is approved by the Board;\n\u2022\nDetailed monthly reporting of performance against budget; and\n\u2022 Central control over key areas such as capital expenditure authorisation and banking facilities.\nThe Company continues to review its system of internal control to ensure compliance with best practice, whilst also having regard to its size and the resources available. The Board considers that the introduction of an internal audit function is not appropriate at this juncture. The CEO has overall responsibility for corporate governance and in promoting high standards throughout the Company. He leads and chairs the Board, ensuring that that performance of individual Directors, the Board and its committees are reviewed on a regular basis, leads in the development of strategy and setting objectives, and oversees communication between the Company and its shareholders.\nThe Executive Director is responsible for implementing and delivering the strategy and operational decisions agreed by the Board, making operational and financial decisions required in the day-to-day operation of the Company, providing executive leadership to managers, championing the Company\u2019s core values and promoting talent management.\nThe Independent Non-Executive Directors contribute independent thinking and judgement through the application of their external experience and knowledge, scrutinise the performance of management, provide constructive challenge to the Executive Director and ensure that the Company is operating within the governance and risk framework approved by the Board.\nThe Board reviews annually the effectiveness of its corporate governance structures and processes. The primary duty of the Board is to act in the best interests of the Company at all times. The Board also addresses issues relating to internal control and the Company\u2019s approach to risk management.\nThe Company has also implemented a code for Directors\u00b4 and employees\u00b4 dealings in securities which is appropriate for a company whose securities are traded on the London Stock Exchange and is in accordance with the requirements of the Market Abuse Regulation which came into effect in 2016.\nPrinciple 10 \u2013 Shareholder Communication\nThe Board is committed to maintaining good communication with its shareholders and investors, providing them with such information on the Company\u2019s progress as is permitted by MAR and the requirements of the relevant legislation. The Board believes that the Company\u2019s Annual Report and Accounts, and its Interim Report published after the half year, play an important part in presenting all shareholders with an assessment of the Company\u2019s position and prospects.\nThe Annual General Meeting is the principal opportunity for private shareholders to meet and discuss the Company\u2019s business with the Directors.\nThere is an open question and answer session during which shareholders may ask questions both about the resolutions being proposed and the business in general.\nThe Directors are also available after the meeting for an informal discussion with shareholders. Results of shareholder meetings and details of votes cast will be publicly announced through RNS and displayed on the Company\u2019s website with suitable explanations of any actions undertaken as a result of any significant votes against resolutions.\nAll reports and press releases are published on the Group\u2019s website:\nwww.gvmh.co.uk\n, and the Company will continue to keep its website up to date, participate in investor presentations, attend conferences and release news flow and operational updates as appropriate.\nApplication of principles of good governance by the board of directors\nThe board currently comprises the three directors: Frederick Chua Oon Kian,\nAjay Kumar Rajpal\nand\nJonathan Yat Pang Lo\n. Only\nJonathan Yat Pang Lo\nis executive director \u2013 the others are non-executive directors.\nThere are regular board meetings each year and other meetings are held as required to direct the overall Company strategy and operations. Board meetings follow a formal agenda covering matters specifically reserved for decision by the board. These cover key areas of the Company\u2019s affairs including overall strategy, acquisition policy, approval of budgets, major capital expenditure and significant transactions and financing issues.\nThe board undertakes a formal annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors, through discussions and one-to-one reviews with the chairman and the senior independent director.\nStatement of disclosure to auditors\nEach person who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:\n\u2022\nSo far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company\u2019s auditors are unaware; and\n\u2022\nEach Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company\u2019s auditors are aware of that information.\n\u2022\nEach Director is aware of and concurs with the information included in the Strategic Report.\nPost Balance Sheet Events\nFurther information on events after the reporting date is set out in note 24.\nBranches Outside the UK\nThe Group head office is in\nHong Kong\nand the subsidiaries are located in\nHong Kong\nand\nChina\n.\nThe Directors\u2019 have chosen to produce a Strategic Report that discloses a fair review of the Group\u2019s business, the key performances metrics that the Directors review along with a review of the key risks to the business.\nIn accordance with Section 414C (1) of the Companies Act 2006, the group chooses to report the review of the business, the future outlook and the risks and uncertainties faced by the Company in The Strategic Report on page 4.\nDirectors\u2019 Remuneration Report\nThe remuneration committee consisted of\nAjay Rajpal\nand Frederick Chua Oon Kian. This committee's primary function is to review the performance of executive directors and senior employees and set their remuneration and other terms of employment.\nThe Company has one executive director.\nThe remuneration policy\nIt is the aim of the committee to remunerate executive directors competitively and to reward performance. The remuneration committee determines the company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the UK Corporate Governance Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration.\nService agreements and terms of appointment\nThe directors have service contracts with the company.\nDirectors' interests\nThe directors' interests in the share capital of the company are set out in the Directors\u2019 report.\nDirectors' emoluments\nSalaries and Fees\nGroup\nCompany\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nAjay Rajpal\n480\n480\n120\n120\nJonathan Lo\n1,080\n1,080\n480\n480\n1,560\n1,560\n600\n600\nNo pension contributions were made by the company on behalf of its directors apart for\nJonathan Lo\nof\nHKD18K\n(2023:\nHK$18k\n).\nApproval by shareholders\nAt the next annual general meeting of the company a resolution approving this report is to be proposed as an ordinary resolution.\nThis report was approved by the board on\n27 September 2025\n.\nOn behalf of the board\n__________________\nJonathan Lo\nDirector\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT\nto the Members of Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) and its subsidiaries (together the \u201cGroup\u201d) for the year ended\n31 December 2024\nwhich comprise the Consolidated and Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Cash Flows, and related notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group\u2019s financial statements is applicable law and UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (UK adopted IFRS).\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n\u2022\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the Group\u2019s and of the Parent Company\u2019s affairs as at\n31 December 2024\n, and of the Group\u2019s and the Parent Company\u2019s loss for the year then ended;\n\u2022\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted IFRS; and\n\u2022\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial Uncertainty over going concern\nWe draw your attention to note 2.4 of the financial statements which indicates the directors\u2019 consideration over going concern. The group\u2019s ability to generate funds to meet short term operating cash requirements and loan repayments is reliant on the group\u2019s ability to obtain alternative financing. The timing of sales is uncertain and as a result the group is currently reliant on additional funding from shareholders and a director. These events and conditions, along with other matters as set out in Note 2.4 indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements we have concluded that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors\u2019 assessment of the entity\u2019s ability to continue adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n-\nWe evaluated management\u2019s going concern assumptions which included assessing their business and strategic plans, liquidity and funding position for the group. We checked that the going concern assessment from management covered a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of financial statements.\n-\nWe challenged the appropriateness of judgements and assumptions considered by management in cashflow forecasts in determining the funds required from certain shareholders and a director during the going concern period.\n-\nWe performed sensitivity analysis on the cash flows based on applying more conservative assumptions to forecast revenues and operating costs.\n-\nWe checked the confirmations received from the majority shareholders and director and confirmed that the financial support is agreed to be provided for at least 12 months from the date of approval of financial statements.\n-\nWe checked the evidence of the financial position of the majority shareholders to confirm that they have financial means to be able to support the Group (when required).\n-\nWe checked confirmation form the convertible loan note holders confirming that they will not demand repayment of the outstanding loan for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of financial statements.\n-\nWe checked whether the disclosures in the financial statements were fairly stated, complete and accurate in all material respects.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nOur audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group\u2019s system of internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including assessing whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may have presented a risk of material misstatement. The scope of our audit was influenced by the level of materiality we determined.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account an understanding of their activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\nOur planned audit testing was directed accordingly and was focused on areas where we assessed there to be the highest risk of material misstatement.\nDuring the audit we reassessed and re-evaluated audit risks and tailored our approach accordingly. The audit testing included substantive testing on significant transactions, balances and disclosures, the extent of which was based on various factors such as our overall assessment of the control environment, the effectiveness of controls and the management of specific risks.\nWe communicated with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during the audit.\nOur involvement with component auditors\nWe designed an audit strategy to ensure that we obtained the required audit assurance for each component for the purposes of our Group audit opinion (in accordance with ISA 600 (Revised - UK)). Components were scoped based on the assessed risks at the entity level, with consideration given to aggregation risk, to ensure that sufficient coverage of group balances was obtained to support our audit opinion. For the work performed by component auditors in\nHong Kong\n, we determined the level of involvement needed in order to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. Our involvement with component auditors included the following:\nDetailed Group reporting instructions were sent, which included the significant areas to be covered by the audits (including areas that were considered to be key audit matters as detailed below), and set out the information required to be reported to the Group audit team.\nThe Group audit team performed procedures independently over certain key audit risk areas, as considered necessary, including the key audit matters below.\nRegular communication throughout the planning and execution phase of the audit.\nThe Group audit team was actively involved in risk assessment and the direction of the audits performed by the component auditors for Group reporting purposes, review of their working papers, consideration of findings and determination of conclusions drawn.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether due to fraud or error) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nExcept for the matter described in Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.\nOther matters\nThe financial statements of Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc for the year ended\n31 December 2024\nwere audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion with materiality uncertainty on going concern on those statements on\n29 March 2024\n.\nOur application of materiality\nOur definition of materiality considers the value of error or omission on the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, would change or influence the economic decision of a reasonably knowledgeable user of those financial statements. Misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of the identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole. Materiality is used in planning the scope of our work, executing that work and evaluating the results.\nGroup Financial statements\nCompany Financial statements\nOverall materiality\n2024: HK$34,000 (2023: HK$59,600)\n2024: HK$18,500 (2023: HK$3,104)\nBasis for determining overall materiality\nWe determined materiality based on 1% of the revenue (2023: 1% revenue).\nThe Group is incurring losses therefore its focus is towards increasing the revenue to achieve breakeven. The group is in growth stage; therefore, revenue provides a clearer picture of the group\u2019s ability to generate revenue and grow its market presence. Furthermore, Investors in growth stage companies often focus on revenue as an indicator of potential profitability in the future. Hence, we believe that revenue is the most appropriate benchmark for assessing the group materiality.\nWe determined materiality based on 1% of the expenses (2023: 5% total assets).\nThe company operates solely as a holding entity with no trading activities in the UK, its primary expenditures comprise regulatory and administrative costs. We believe that using total expenses as the basis of materiality is the most appropriate and representative approach. The investors focus would be on expenses of the company to maintain its profitability and operations.\nPerformance materiality\nHK$ 17,000 (2023: HK$41,720)\nWe set the performance materiality based on 50% (2023:70%) of overall materiality.\nHK$ 9,250 (2023: HK$2,172)\nWe set the performance materiality based on 50% (2023:70%) of overall materiality.\nPerformance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level, set at an amount to reduce, to an appropriately low level, the probability that the aggregate of the uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nIn determining performance materiality, we considered several factors including our understanding of the control environment of the Group and the Company.\nError reporting threshold\nWe agreed to report any corrected or uncorrected adjustments exceeding HK$ 1,700 (2023: HK$ 2,300) to the Board of directors as well as differences below this threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nWe agreed to report any corrected or uncorrected adjustments exceeding HK$ 925 to the Board of directors as well as differences below this threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nOther information\nOther information comprises the information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the audit:\n\u2022\nthe information given in the Strategic Review Report, Directors Report and Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u2022\nthe Strategic Review Report, Directors Report and Directors Remuneration Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained during the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the CEO\u2019s Report incorporating review of operations, strategic Review report, and Director\u2019s Report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\nadequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\nthe financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\ncertain disclosures of directors\u2019 remuneration specified by law are not made; or\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement set out on page 10, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken based on these financial statements.\nExtent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.\nThese audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting material misstatement due to a fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collision.\nIdentifying and assessing potential risks arising from irregularities, including fraud\nThe extent of the procedures undertaken to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, included the following:\nWe considered the nature of the industry and sector, the control environment, business performance including remuneration policies and the Group\u2019s own risk assessment that irregularities might occur as a result of fraud or error. From our sector experience and through discussions with the directors, we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group focusing on laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct material effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the Companies Act 2006, UK tax legislation, London Stock Exchange rules and regulations, Hong Kong Company Law and tax laws or those that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group.\nWe made enquiries of directors and management concerning the Group\u2019s policies and procedures relating to:\nIdentifying, evaluating, and complying with the laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\nDetecting and responding on the risks of fraud and whether they had any knowledge of actual or suspected fraud; and\nThe internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by evaluating management\u2019s incentives and opportunities for manipulation of the financial statements. This included utilising the spectrum of inherent risk and an evaluation of the risk of management override of controls. We determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries creating fictitious transactions to improve financial performance, and management bias in accounting estimates.\nAudit response to risks identified\nIn respect of the above procedures:\n\u2022\nwe corroborated the results of our enquiries through review of the minutes of the Board of directors meetings.\n\u2022\naudit procedures performed by the engagement team in connection with the risks identified included the following:\no\nreviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations expected to have a direct impact on the financial statements.\no\ntesting journal entries, including those processed late for financial statements preparation, those posted by infrequent or unexpected users, those posted to unusual account combinations.\no\nevaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for bias.\no\nenquiry of management around actual and potential litigation and claims.\no\nchallenging the assumptions and judgments made by management in relation to significant accounting estimates; and\no\nobtaining confirmations from third parties to confirm existence of certain balances.\n\u2022\nwe communicated relevant laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members and remained alert to any indication of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities\n. This description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\nOther requirements\nWe were appointed by the Group on\n13 February 2025\nto audit the financial statements of the Group for the year-ended\n31 December 2024\nand subsequent financial periods.

Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc\u2019s (GVMH) head office is in\nHong Kong\nfrom where it is managed. These consolidated financial statements comprise GVMH and its subsidiaries. GVMH and its subsidiaries are primarily involved in social media marketing.\nAccounting policies\n2.1.\nStatement of compliance\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards.\n2.2.\nBasis of preparation of the financial statements\nThe consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the \u201cGroup\u201d). The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the standalone financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with applicable UK law and UK adopted International Accounting Standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Directors consider that the financial information presented in these Financial Statements represents fairly the financial position, operations and cash flows for the year, in conformity with IFRS. As a result of UK endorsement of IFRS, there were no adjustments required.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All of the subsidiaries have the same reporting date of 31 December each year.\nChanges in accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended\n31 December 2023\n, except for the adoption of the new standards and policies applicable for the year ended\n31 December 2024\n. The significant accounting policies adopted during the year are set out below. They have been assessed as having minimal or no financial impact.\n2.3.\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments effective in the current financial year have not had a material impact on the consolidated Group financial statements.\nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning\n1 January 2024\n:\n\u2022 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\n\u2022 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\n\u2022 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)\n\u2022 Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7\nThe following new and revised IFRS Standards have been issued but are not yet effective and not early adopted by the Company are as follows:\n\u2022 Lack of Exchangeability (Amendment to IAS 2) - Effective\n1 January 2025\n\u2022 Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS7) - Effective\n1 January 2026\n\u2022 IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements - Effective\n1 January 2027\n\u2022 IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without public accountability- effective\n1 January 2027\nThe Directors have not early adopted the Standards listed above. The Directors have determined that they will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company in future periods if they are to early adopt.\n2.4.\nGoing concern\nThe Group incurred a loss of\nHKD6,638k\nfor the year ended\n31 December 2024\n(2023: loss of\nHKD3,982k\n) and was in a net liability position of\nHKD51,653k\nas at that date (2023:\nHKD45,452k\n). These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s and the Parent Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn considering the appropriateness of preparing the financial statements on a going concern basis, the directors have obtained written confirmations from certain shareholders, convertible loan note holders and a director that they will provide financial support to the Group and the Parent Company for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nThe Group finances its day-to-day working capital requirements through cash flow from operations and shareholder loans. In assessing going concern, the Directors have taken into account the written confirmations of support, reviewed internal budgets, cash flow forecasts and financial performance, and are satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Parent Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required if the Group and the Parent Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\n2.5.\nSubsidiaries and non-controlling interests and GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries reorganisation accounting\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\nIn\nJune 2018\n, Grand Vision Media Holdings Plc (\u201cCompany\u201d) acquired the entire issued share capital of GVC Holdings Limited (\u201clegal subsidiary\u201d) in exchange of issuance of shares to GVC Holdings Limited.\nAs the legal subsidiary is reversed into the Company (the legal parent), which originally was a publicly listed cash shell company, this transaction cannot be considered a business combination, as the Company, the accounting acquiree does not meet the definition of a business, under IFRS 3 \u2018Business Combinations\u2019.\nHowever, the accounting for such capital transaction should be treated as a share- based payment transaction and therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 \u2018Share-based payment\u2019. Any difference in the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by the GVC Holdings Limited (accounting acquirer) and the fair value of Grand Vision Media Holdings PLC\u2019s (the accounting acquiree) identifiable net assets represents a service received by the accounting acquirer.\nAlthough the consolidated financial information has been issued in the name of Grand Vision Media Holdings PLC, the legal parent, it represents in substance continuation of the financial information of the legal subsidiary.\nThe assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary are recognized and measured in the Group financial statements at the pre-combination carrying amounts and not re-stated at fair value.\nThe retained earnings and other reserves balances recognized in the Group financial statements reflect the retained earnings and other reserves balances of the legal subsidiary immediately before the business combination and the results of the period from\nJune 2018\nto the date of the business combination are those of the legal subsidiary only.\n2.6.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and are recognised in profit or loss on the date of retirement or disposal.\nDepreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment, less their estimated residual value, if any, using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nDisplay panels and CMS\n30% - 33.33%\nComputer equipment\n30% - 33.33%\nFurniture\u2019s and fixtures\n30% - 33.33%\nLeasehold improvements\n30% - 50%\nBoth the useful life of an asset and its residual value, if any, are reviewed annually.\nThe carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is compared to the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. If the carrying value exceeds the higher of the value in use and fair value less the costs to sell the asset, then the asset is impaired and its value reduced by recognising an impairment provision.\n2.7.\nImpairment of non-financial assets, other than inventories\nAt the end of each reporting period, property, plant and equipment and investments in a subsidiary are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset (or GVC Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries of related assets) is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If an estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nIf an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or GVC Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries of related assets) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (GVC Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries of related assets) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n2.8.\nTrade and other receivables\nThe Group classifies all its financial assets as trade and other receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.\nTrade receivables and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables financial assets. Loans and receivables financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment loss.\nThe Group\u2019s loans and receivables financial assets comprise other receivables (excluding prepayments) and cash and cash equivalents included in the Statement of Financial Position.\n2.9.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balance. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of GVMH PLC\u2019s cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement.\n2.10.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the effect of discounting would be immaterial, in which case they are stated at cost.\n2.11.\nShareholders loan\nShareholders loans are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the fair value and the carrying amortised cost (i.e. the effective interest portion) is first recognized in equity as capital contribution reserve.\n2.12.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term benefits\nWages, salaries, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.\n2.13.\nTaxation\n(i) Current tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from \u2018profit before tax\u2019 as reported in the statement of profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and items that are never taxable or deductible. Grand Vision Media Holding Plc\u2019s current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted during the reporting period.\n(ii) Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:\n\u2022\nthe initial recognition of goodwill;\n\u2022\nthe initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and\n\u2022\ninvestments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.\nThe amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are settled or recovered. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.\n2.14.\nProvision and contingent liabilities\nProvisions are recognised for other liabilities of uncertain timing or amount when the Group or the Company has a legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expenditure expected to settle the obligation.\nWhere it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n2.15.\nRevenue recognition\nThe company recognise revenue from contracts with customers when (or as) the company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (i.e., an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. When (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, the company recognises as revenue the amount of the transaction price (which includes estimates of variable consideration that are constrained in accordance with IFRS 15) that is allocated to that performance obligation. Further details of the company\u2019s revenue and other income recognition policies are as follows:\n(i)\nService income is recognised as income on a straight-line based over the term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user\u2019s benefit.\n(ii)\nBarter revenue is recognised only when the goods or services being exchanged are of a dissimilar nature. Barter revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services rendered, adjusted by the amount of cash or cash equivalents received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services rendered cannot be reliably measured, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, again adjusted by the amount of cash or cash equivalents received\n(iii)\nInterest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognised using the original effective interest rate.\n2.16.\nTranslation of foreign currencies\nForeign currency transactions during the year are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the end of the reporting period. Exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates.\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was measured.\nThe results of foreign operations are translated into\nHong Kong\ndollars at the exchange rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Statement of financial position items, including goodwill arising on consolidation of foreign operations, are translated into\nHong Kong\ndollars at the closing foreign exchange rates at the end of the reporting period. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated separately in equity as exchange reserve.\nOn disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the profit or loss on disposal is recognised.\nExchange rates used in these accounts :\nGBP/HKD : 9.73\nRMB/HKD : 1.08\nThe functional currency of the Group is Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), its subsidiaries are also in HKD. The functional currency of the Company is British Pound (GBP).\nThe presentational currency of the Group and the Company is HKD because a significant amount of its transactions is in HKD.\nTransactions entered by the Group\u2019s entities in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transaction occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the statement of financial position date. Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of outstanding monetary assets and liabilities are also recognised in the income statement.\n2.17.\nFinancial instruments\nIFRS 9 requires an entity to address the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities.\nFinancial Assets\na) Classification\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\u2022\nthose to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss); and\n\u2022\nthose to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the Group\u2019s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded either in profit or loss or in OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\nThe Group classifies financial assets as at amortised costs only if both of the following criteria are met:\n\u2022\nthe asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\u2022\nthe contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest.\nb) Recognition\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date (that is, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset). Financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\nc) Measurement\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\nTransaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\nd) Impairment\nThe Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with any debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\nFinancial liabilities\nA financial liability is recognised when the Group becomes a party to contractual promises of a financial instrument. Financial liabilities are initially measured at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs (where applicable). In subsequent periods, financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities as trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nConvertible loan note\nConvertible loan notes are accounted for as compound financial instruments, comprising a liability component and an equity component. On initial recognition, the fair value of the liability component is determined using a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument without a conversion feature. The difference between the gross proceeds of the issue and the fair value of the liability component is recognized in equity as the equity component of the convertible instrument, net of transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component is not remeasured after initial recognition. Interest expense is recognized in profit or loss on the liability component using the effective interest rate method.\n2.18.\nSegmental analysis\nIn the opinion of the directors, the group has one class of business being social media advertising. The groups primary reporting format is determined by geographical segment. There is currently only one geographical reporting segment which is People\u2019s\nRepublic of China\n.\n2.19.\nLeases\nDefinition of a lease\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nFor contracts entered into or modified or arising from business combinations on or after the date of initial application, the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition under IFRS 16 at inception, modification date or acquisition date, as appropriate. Such contract will not be reassessed unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently changed.\nThe Group as a lessee\nAllocation of consideration to components of a contract.\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components and the aggregate stand-alone price of non-lease components.\nNon-lease components are separated from lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\nAs a practical expedient, leases with similar characteristics are accounted on a portfolio basis when the Group reasonably expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements would not differ materially from individual leases within the portfolio.\nShort-term leases\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis over the lease term.\nRight-of-use assets\nThe cost of right-of-use asset includes:\n\uf09f\nthe amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n\uf09f\nany lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;\n\uf09f\nany initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and\n\uf09f\nan estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying assets, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\nRight-of-use assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term are depreciated from commencement date to the end of the useful life. Otherwise, right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.\nRefundable rental deposits\nRefundable rental deposits paid are accounted under IFRS 9 and initially measured at fair value. Adjustments to fair value at initial recognition are considered as additional lease payments and included in the cost of right-of-use assets.\nLease liabilities\nWhen recognising the lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases, the Group has applied incremental borrowing rates of the relevant group entities at the date of initial application. The incremental borrowing rates applied by the relevant group entities.\nThe lease payments include:\n\uf09f\nfixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;\n\uf09f\nvariable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n\uf09f\namounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; \u2022 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and\n\uf09f\npayments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.\nThe Group presents lease liabilities as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies which are detailed above. These judgements are continually evaluated by the Directors and management and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe key estimates and underlying assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe estimates and judgements which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, as well as the recognition of revenue, within the next financial year are discussed below:\n\u2022 Provision for impairment on trade receivables\nThe Group determines the provision for impairment on trade receivables. This estimate is based on the credit history of the customers and the current market condition. Management reassesses the adequacy of provision on a regular basis by reviewing the individual account based on past credit history and any prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk which might not be easily accessible public information and market volatility might bear a significant impact which might not be easily ascertained.\n\u2022 Recognising appropriate revenue in line with performance obligations\nManagement identifies the performance obligations associated with each contract and then exercises judgement to establish an appropriate percentage of the total transaction price to recognise once each identified performance obligation is successfully completed.\nRevenue and other income\nDetails of GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries\u2019 revenue and other income is as follows:\nGroup\n2024\nGroup\n2023\nCompany 2024\nCompany 2023\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nRevenue\nAdvertising fee income\n-\n780\n-\n-\nDigital marketing income\n3,431\n5,149\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n33\n-\n-\n3,431\n5,962\n-\n-\nOther income\nSundry income\n7\n6\n-\n-\n7\n6\n-\n-\nAll revenue is earned outside the UK.\nFinance costs\nGroup\n2024\nGroup\n2023\nCompany 2024\nCompany\n2023\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nFinance costs\nInterest expense on lease liabilities\n6\n18\n-\n-\n6\n18\n-\n-\nAdministrative expenses\nGroup\n2024\nGroup\n2023\nCompany 2024\nCompany\n2023\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\n(Restated)\n(Restated)\nAudit fees\n843\n322\n719\n198\nBusiness development and marketing\n-\n11\n-\n-\nDepreciation and amortisation\n536\n585\n-\n-\nLegal and professional fee\n546\n496\n519\n462\nOffice rental\n94\n39\n-\n-\nOverseas travelling\n71\n17\n-\n-\nOther\n896\n801\n27\n1\nDirector\u2019s fees and emoluments\n1,202\n1,202\n599\n583\n583\n585\nWages and Salaries\n2,106\n2,236\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6,294\n5,709\n1,864\n1,244\n,202\n1,432\nEmployee numbers\nNo.\nNo.\nNo.\nNo.\nManagement\n3\n3\n2\n2\nOperations\n8\n12\n-\n-\n11\n15\n2\n2\nIncome tax expense\nNo tax provision made in the accounts as GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries do not have any taxable profits for the year (2023: nil).\nReconciliation between tax expenses and accounting profit at applicable tax rates of 16.5% in\nHong Kong\nand 19% in the UK and 25% in PRC.\nGroup\n2024\nGroup\n2023\nCompany\n2024\nCompany 2023\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\n(Restated)\n(Restated)\nLoss before tax\n(6,638)\n(3,982)\n(1,826)\n(487)\nNotional tax on loss before taxation, calculated at the rates applicable to loss in the countries concerned\n(1,141)\n(669)\n(347)\n(93)\nTax effect on unrecognised tax loss\n1,141\n669\n347\n93\nActual tax expenses\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGVMH PLC and its subsidiaries has not recognised deferred tax assets of\nHK$4,201,127\n(2023:\nHK$3,610,224\n) in respect of accelerated depreciation over capital allowances.

Any amount received in excess of par value is considered as the share premium in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n(b)\nCapital management\nThe Group objective when managing capital are to safeguard the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefit for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to shareholders.\nThe Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. No changes were made in the objectives, policies and processes during the year of 2024 and 2023.\nThe Group monitors\u2019 capital using a gearing ratio, which are calculated by dividing consolidated debts by consolidated total shareholder's equity plus consolidated deb\nt. The gearing ratio is currently high, indicating that the Group is highly leveraged. To maintain financial stability, the management of the Group will aim to manage the gearing ratio at a more reasonable level.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Group has classified its financial assets and financial liabilities in the following categories:\nGroup\n2024\nGroup\n2023\nCompany\n2024\nCompany\n2023\nFinancial Assets\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nTrade receivables\n213\n1,399\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents\n11\n291\n4\n5\nTotal\n224\n1,690\n4\n5\nGroup\n2024\nGroup\n2023\nCompany\n2024\nCompany\n2023\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nTrade and other payables\n10,910\n14,768\n1,240\n3,605\nShareholders' loan\n22,340\n22,361\n953\n974\nLease liability\n-\n533\n-\n-\nConvertible loans\n5,232\n5,335\n5,232\n5,335\nAmount due to a director\n13,525\n4,926\n4,035\n-\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost\n52,007\n47,923\n11,460\n9,914\nThe Group are exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising in the normal course of its business and financial instruments. The Group and the Company\u2019s risk management objectives, policies and processes mainly focus on minimising the potential adverse effects of these risks on its financial performance and position by closely monitoring the individual exposure.\n(a)\nCredit risk\nGVMH PLC and its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk on financial assets, mainly attributable to trade receivables. It sets credit limits on each individual customer and prior approval is required for any transaction exceeding that limit. The customer with sound payment history would accumulate a higher credit limit. In addition, the overseas customers would normally be required to transact with GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries\u2019 and GVMH PLC by letter of credit in order to minimise GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries\u2019 credit risk exposure.\nAt\n31 December 2024\n, GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries has no concentration of risk and the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.\n(b)\nLiquidity risk\nGVMH PLC and its subsidiaries is exposed to liquidity risk on financial liabilities. It manages its funds conservatively by maintaining a comfortable level of cash and cash equivalents in order to meet continuous operational need. The financial support from shareholder have been arranged in order to fund any emergency liquidity requirements.\nThe Group\nWithin 12 months\nLater than 1 year but not 5 years\nCarrying amount\nAs at 31 December 2024\nTrade and other payables\n10,910\n-\n14,039\nShareholders' loan \u2013 current\n21,387\n-\n21,387\nConvertible bonds\n-\n5,232\n5,232\nShareholders\u2019 loan \u2013 non-current\n-\n953\n953\nAmount due to Director\n13,525\n-\n10,396\n45,822\n6,185\n52,007\nAs at 31 December 2023 (Restated)\nTrade and other payables\n14,768\n-\n14,768\nShareholders' loan \u2013 current\n21,387\n-\n21,387\nConvertible bonds\n-\n5,335\n5,335\nShareholders\u2019 loan \u2013 non-current\n-\n974\n974\nLease liabilities\n533\n-\n533\nAmount due to Director\n4,926\n-\n4,926\n41,614\n6,309\n47,923\nThe Company\nAs at 31 December 2024\nTrade and other payables\n1,240\n-\n1,240\nConvertible bonds\n-\n5,232\n5,232\nShareholders' loan \u2013 non-current\n-\n953\n953\nAmount due to Director\n4,035\n-\n4,035\n5,275\n6,185\n11,460\nAs at 31 December 2023 (Restated)\nTrade and other payables\n3,605\n-\n3,605\nConvertible bonds\n-\n5,335\n5,335\nShareholders' loan \u2013 non current\n-\n974\n974\n3,605\n6,309\n9,914\n(c)\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group has no exposure on fair value interest rate risk. It also has exposure on cash flow interest rate risk which is mainly arising from its deposits with banks.\nNo material exposure on fair value interest rate risk is expected. Even that, GVMH PLC closely monitors the fair value fluctuation of the investments.\n(d)\nCurrency risk\nGVMH PLC and its subsidiaries purchases and sells in various foreign currencies, mainly RMB and GBP that expose it to currency risk arising from such purchases and sales and the resulting receivables and the payables.\nGVMH PLC and its subsidiaries closely and continuously monitors the exposure on currency risk. Since HK dollars are pegged to US dollars, there is no significant exposure expected on US dollars transactions and balances.\nIn respect of purchases and payables, GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries controls its volume of purchase orders to a tolerable level and avoids concentrating the purchases in a single foreign currency by diversifying such foreign currency risk exposure.\nIn respect of sales and receivables, GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries sets a prudent credit limit to individual customers who transact with it in other foreign currencies. The directors\u2019 approval is required on the exposure to an individual customer or transaction that exceeds the limit.\nLeases liabilities\nThe Group has lease contracts for leasehold land and building used in its operations. Lease of leasehold land and building generally have lease terms between 2 to 3 years. The Group's obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor's title to the lease asset. Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and subleasing the leased assets.\nThe Group also has certain leases of land and building with lease terms of 12 months or less. The Company applies the \u2018short-term lease\u2019 recognition exemptions for these leases.\nSet out below are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities and the movements during the year:\nLease liabilities\nHK$\u2019000\nAt 31 December 2022\n1,104\nAccretion of interest recognised during the year\n18\nPayments\n(589)\nAt 31 December 2023\n533\nAccretion of interest recognised during the year\n6\nPayments\n(539)\nAt 31 December 2024\n-\nThe following are the amounts recognised in profit or loss:\n2024\n2023\nHK$\u2019000\nHK$\u2019000\nInterest on lease liabilities\n6\n18\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets\n527\n576\nExpenses relating to short-term leases\n45\n39\nTotal amount recognised in profit or loss\n578\n633\nThe Group had total cash outflows for leases of HK$539K (2023: HK$589k) and no additions to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the year (2023: HK$nil).\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\nContingent liabilities\nAt 31 December 2024, GVMH PLC and its subsidiaries did not have any contingent liabilities.\nMaterial related party transactions\nKey management personnel compensation\nKey management are considered to be the directors of the Company. Details of their remuneration and equity holdings are disclosed in the page 17 and page 9 of the Directors Report.\nTransactions with subsidiarie\ns\nTransactions between the Group and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation. The balance due from subsidiaries at the year-end was nil due to fully impaired (2023: HK$Nil).\nTransactions with director and shareholder\nNo interest recognised by the Group and the Company on outstanding balances during the year (2023: HK$Nil).

Mr. Stephen Nai Wai Lo is the father of Mr. Jonathan Yat Pang Lo.\n-\nThe gross balance due to Win Network International Limited including convertible loan at the year end is HK$5,217k (2023: HK$5,315k).\nThe ultimate shareholder of Win Network Limited is\nMr. Stephen Nai Wai Lo.\n-\nThe gross balance due to shareholder, Pentawood Limited including convertible loan at the year end is HK$5,231k (2023: HK$5,253k).\nTransactions of convertible bonds\nNo interest recognised by the Company during the year (2023: HK$Nil).

Financial support a from shareholder and director, Mr. Jonathan Yat Pang Lo has been arranged in order to fund any emergency liquidity requirements.\nComparatives figures\nIn 2024, the Company identified errors in its previously issued financial statements for prior fiscal years. The restatement primarily relates to adjustments to the group reorganisation reserve, share capital, share premium, and exchange reserves. Additionally, corrections were made to administrative expenses, affecting accruals, payables, prepayments, and amounts due to directors.\nWhile the restatement does not impact reported revenue, it results in adjustments to operating expenses due to the revised treatment of certain costs. Consequently, these corrections also affect cash flows for the relevant periods. The restatement further impacts the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity, and related disclosures.
