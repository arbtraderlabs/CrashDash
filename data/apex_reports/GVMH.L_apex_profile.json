These two companies were non-trading holding companies, and therefore this change has no effect on the group\u2019s operations.\nAs part of this exercise, the two external minority shareholders of Grand Vision Communications Ltd have decided to divest their respective holdings, and have agreed to sell their shareholdings to the group for a nominal consideration of\nUS$1\neach, following a decision by them to concentrate on their other respective business interests. This has the result of removing the minority interests in this part of the group only.\nThe Directors accept responsibility for this announcement.\nFor more information:\nGrand Vision Media Holdings plc\nhttp://gvmh.co.uk/\nJonathan Lo, Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7866 2145 or info@gvmh.co.uk\nAlfred Henry Corporate Finance Ltd\nNick Michaels / Jon Isaacs\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3772 0021 or enquiries@alfredhenry.com\n- ENDS -"

Whilst the core business has suffered badly from the ongoing business disruption and uncertainty caused by the pandemic in the region, the Group has been focussing on generating new revenue streams to bolster revenues. It is hoped that these new revenue streams will come to fruition in 2022 onwards.\nSummary of Trading Results\nRevenue in the period was\nHKD1,742K\n[1H2019 :\nHKD6,045K\n], which represents a significant decline as compared to the prior year period. The Group had a loss after tax of\nHKD3,335K\n[1H2019 :\nHKD664K\nloss]. This was primarily as a result of the reduced turnover resulting from the ongoing business disruption. To mitigate against this, the Group has managed to achieve cost savings as a result of space consolidation and headcount reductions, and has taken advantage of Government fiscal support aimed at helping businesses through the pandemic whenever this was available. However, this did not prevent the overall poor Group performance as reported.\nCash in hand at the period end was\nHK$490K\n. The Group continues to manage its cash within its available resources.\nOutlook\nThe Group has suffered enormously from the business disruption and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, and particularly more so as\nHong Kong/China\nhave been following a strict zero COVID policy. The full year results for 2021 are expected to be well below historic levels again, but the Group remains committed to sourcing new revenue streams to mitigate against the decline in traditional revenues.\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na. the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \u2018Interim Financial Reporting\u2019;\nb. the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six\nmonths of the year; and,\nc. the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties\u2019 transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to\nassess the Company\u2019s strategies and the potential for those strategies to succeed.

The prospectus is available on the Company's current website,\nhttp://www.simianglobal.com\n, and from its registered address at Finsgate, 5-7 Cranwood Street,\nLondon\n, EC1V 9EE. A copy of the prospectus has also been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism.\nThe Company announced on\n17 February 2018\nthat it had conditionally agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of GVCHL, the consideration for which is an aggregate value of the Pound Sterling equivalent of approximately\n$16 million\nto be satisfied by the issue and allotment of Ordinary Shares in Simian. The acquisition is conditional, inter alia, upon Admission and should it complete, the enlarged group will become engaged in business that (a) provides 3D digital panels that do not require glasses to be installed within cinema complexes, offering advertisers access to the growing number of cinemagoers in\nChina\n, and (b) develops and manages out-of-home media networks and provides integrated marketing services.\nThe purpose of the prospectus, which has been posted to shareholders of Simian, is to explain the background to and reasons for the Acquisition, which is in line with the Company\u2019s strategy. The Acquisition, if completed, will constitute a Reverse Takeover under the Listing Rules because of the size of GVCHL in relation to that of the Company and the fact that it will give rise to a fundamental change to the business, board composition and voting control of the Company resulting in the Company becoming an operating company. The Company indicated in its Original Prospectus that it would seek shareholder approval for a Reverse Takeover despite this not being a specific requirement of the Listing Rules.\nShareholder approval is also required under the Takeover Code to approve a Waiver of Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (\u201cthe Code Waiver\u201d). This is explained in detail in the prospectus.\nAccordingly, a General Meeting of the Company is being convened at which resolutions will be proposed, inter alia, to approve the Acquisition, the issue and allotment of the consideration shares, the placing shares and success fee shares, the issue and allotment of option shares, the Code Waiver and the change of the Company\u2019s name. The Resolutions are set out in full in the notice of General Meeting which has been dispatched to all shareholders. An electronic copy of the notice is also available on the Company's website\nhttp://simianglobal.com/investor-relations/circular-to-shareholders/\n.\nThe General Meeting will be held at\n11.00 a.m.\non\n18 June 2018\nat Finsgate, 5-7 Cranwood Street,\nLondon\n, EC1V 9EE.\nFor more information:\nSimian Global Plc\nwww.simianglobal.com\nEdward Kwan-Mang Ng, Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7866 2145 or info@simianglobal.com\nAlfred Henry Corporate Finance Ltd\nJon Isaacs or Nick Michaels\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3772 0021 or jisaacs@alfredhenry.com"
