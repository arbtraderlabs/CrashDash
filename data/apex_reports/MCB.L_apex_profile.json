B Shares carry no rights to attend, speak or vote at Company meetings, except on a resolution relating to the winding up of the Company.\nOnce the Ordinary Shares are cancelled, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 177,281,920. This figure may be used by shareholders of the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest, or a change to their interest, in the Company pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (the \"\nDTRs\n\").\nThe Company confirms that, in accordance with DTR 5.5.1R, following the Purchases the percentage of voting rights attributable to the Ordinary Shares held in treasury is 0.02 per cent.\nThe tables below contain detailed information about the Purchases.\nSchedule of Purchases:\nIssuer name: McBride plc\nISIN:

B Shares carry no rights to attend, speak or vote at Company meetings, except on a resolution relating to the winding up of the Company.\nOnce the Ordinary Shares are cancelled, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 177,324,904. This figure may be used by shareholders of the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest, or a change to their interest, in the Company pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (the \"\nDTRs\n\").\nThe Company confirms that, in accordance with DTR 5.5.1R, following the Purchases the percentage of voting rights attributable to the Ordinary Shares held in treasury is 0.02 per cent.\nThe tables below contain detailed information about the Purchases.\nSchedule of Purchases:\nIssuer name: McBride plc\nISIN:
