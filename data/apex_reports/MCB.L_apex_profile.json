Overall demand for private label products remains strong with Private Label Household share of the top 5 markets remaining at recent highs.\nProfitability levels have been maintained through a combination of product engineering, operational improvements and overhead cost control.\nNet debt closed the period at \u00a3120.6m (\u00a3105.2m at 30 June 2025) and on a 12-month trailing EBITDA basis, net debt cover was circa 1.4x (30 June 2025: 1.2x). During the period a total of \u00a312.9m was spent on shareholder returns, comprising dividend payments of \u00a35.2m, a share buy-back programme of \u00a31.3m together with \u00a36.4m share purchases by the Employee Benefit Trust to prevent future equity dilution on incentive awards.\nThe Group's half-year results will be announced on 24 February 2026.\n* Current analysts' expectations refer to a Group compiled consensus for adjusted operating profit for FY26 of \u00a364.0m\nFor further information, please contact:\nMcBride plc\nVia TEAM LEWIS\nChris Smith, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Strickland, Chief Financial Officer\nTEAM LEWIS\nHannah Scott\n+44 20 7802 2634\nGalyna Kulachek\n+44 20 7802 2664\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
