Overall demand for private label products remains strong with Private Label Household share of the top 5 markets remaining at recent highs.\nProfitability levels have been maintained through a combination of product engineering, operational improvements and overhead cost control.\nNet debt closed the period at \u00a3120.6m (\u00a3105.2m at 30 June 2025) and on a 12-month trailing EBITDA basis, net debt cover was circa 1.4x (30 June 2025: 1.2x). During the period a total of \u00a312.9m was spent on shareholder returns, comprising dividend payments of \u00a35.2m, a share buy-back programme of \u00a31.3m together with \u00a36.4m share purchases by the Employee Benefit Trust to prevent future equity dilution on incentive awards.\nThe Group's half-year results will be announced on 24 February 2026.\n* Current analysts' expectations refer to a Group compiled consensus for adjusted operating profit for FY26 of \u00a364.0m\nFor further information, please contact:\nMcBride plc\nVia TEAM LEWIS\nChris Smith, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Strickland, Chief Financial Officer\nTEAM LEWIS\nHannah Scott\n+44 20 7802 2634\nGalyna Kulachek\n+44 20 7802 2664\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The First Tranche is structured in two phases. In respect of the first phase, the Company has entered into a non-discretionary agreement with Investec Bank plc (\"\nInvestec\n\") to act as riskless principal in relation to the purchase of Ordinary Shares for up to \u00a35 million, and the subsequent sale of such Ordinary Shares to the Company. The second phase will be undertaken by Peel Hunt LLP (\"\nPeel Hunt\n\", together with Investec, the \"\nBrokers\n\"). The Company has entered into a non-discretionary agreement with Peel Hunt to act as riskless principal in relation to the purchase of Ordinary Shares for up to \u00a35 million, and the subsequent sale of such Ordinary Shares to the Company.\nPurchases of Ordinary Shares under the First Tranche are expected to commence on 1 December 2025 and to be completed by no later than 30 April 2026. The maximum number of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased by the Company under the First Tranche is 8,700,764.\nThe Brokers will each make trading decisions in relation to the Programme independently of the Company. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares by the Brokers contemplated by this announcement will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange. Any purchases of Ordinary Shares by the Company under the Programme will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe purpose of the Programme is to reduce the share capital of the Company by returning surplus capital to shareholders. Ordinary Shares purchased under the First Tranche will be cancelled. These arrangements are in accordance with the Company's general authority to repurchase shares. The First Tranche will also be conducted within certain pre-set parameters, in accordance with Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules and within the parameters prescribed by the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (both as incorporated into UK domestic law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018).\nFrom time to time, the Board will assess the progress of this Programme in light of the financial situation of the Company and its capital allocation needs. The Company's interim results in February 2026 will include a strategy update which will outline the Company's likely capital needs in the coming years and a view on its future capital allocation.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMcBride plc\nVia Instinctif\nChris Smith, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Strickland, Chief Financial Officer\nInstinctif Partners\n020 7457 2020\nHannah Scott\nGalyna Kulachek\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This will result in a third consecutive year of stable profitability at these levels. The overall market for Private Label Household for the top 5 markets has remained at recent highs, with the most recent quarterly data showing market share at these levels for the 7th consecutive quarter.\nWave 1 of the SAP S\\4 Hana ERP implementation successfully went live at the Middleton production site and Manchester head office on 3 November 2025. The programme focus now moves to Europe, with the next wave of implementations expected later in 2026.\nThe Group has recently exercised the option to extend by one-year to November 2029 its \u20ac175 million multi-currency, sustainability-linked, revolving credit facility agreement. This facility ensures that the Group continues to have significant levels of liquidity headroom.\nShare Buyback and Shareholder Returns\nThe Board continues to have confidence in the Group's strategy, leading market position, and financial prospects, and will continue to assess future investment opportunities in that light. However, the Board believes the current market capitalisation fundamentally undervalues the Group to a significant degree and therefore views the Company's current share price as presenting a compelling opportunity to create substantial shareholder value through capital returns.\nThe Board will therefore commence a \u00a320m share buyback programme shortly, utilising the maximum allowance of approximately 10% of outstanding ordinary shares, using the relevant 2025 AGM resolution being passed as expected later today.\nThe Board intends to pursue buybacks as one of the key priority uses of available capital until the Company's market capitalisation more appropriately reflects the fundamental value of the business. Recognising that the scale of undervaluation warrants a more material response - and as long as the current significant undervaluation persists - the Board will therefore seek shareholder approval to materially expand, up to 25%, the buyback authorisation from the standard 10% of shares outstanding once the current authority is close to being exhausted.\nIn addition, the Company has loaned the Employee Benefit Trust \u00a37.5 million in October and November 2025 in aggregate to purchase shares to meet certain future employee share award obligations, thereby offsetting potential future dilution. The proposed dividend of 3 pence per ordinary share, to be approved later today, provides an additional \u00a35.2 million return to shareholders.\nThe Group's FY26 interim results will be announced on 24 February 2026.\n* Current analysts' expectations refer to a Group compiled consensus for adjusted operating profit for FY26 of \u00a364.3m\nFor further information, please contact:\nMcBride plc\nVia Instinctif\nChris Smith, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Strickland, Chief Financial Officer\nInstinctif Partners\n020 7457 2020\nHannah Scott\nGalyna Kulachek\nNote: This announcement contains inside information which is disclosed in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation which came into effect on 3 July 2016.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The New Ordinary Shares are expected to be admitted to trading on the LSE from 8:00am on 23 October 2025.\nThe New Ordinary Shares are being issued to satisfy the vesting of certain employee share awards, which were granted in 2022. The New Ordinary Shares will rank pari passu with the Company's existing issued ordinary shares.\nThe Company confirms that the New Ordinary Shares being issued fall within the scope of its existing share issuance authorities and have been included in the calculation of potential dilution under the Investment Association's guidelines and the relevant plan rules.\nThe Company intends to make a loan available to Apex Group Fiduciary Services Limited (in its capacity as trustee of The McBride plc Employee Benefit Trust 2012) (the 'Trustee') to purchase the majority, if not all, of the New Ordinary Shares that are sold by employees to cover their tax liabilities which arise as a result of the vesting of the aforementioned share awards. These purchased shares will then be available to the Trustee for the satisfaction of future share awards.\nFollowing admission of the New Ordinary Shares, the Company will have 178,559,903 ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 each in issue (including 42,041 ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 each held in treasury).

The Group continues to make progress in its strategic markets and geographies, driven by strengthening customer partnerships. Total volumes were\nup 4.3% relative to the prior year period with private label volumes up 1.4% and\ncontract manufacturing volumes up 48.9%, driven by the full-year impacts of significant new long-term contracts.\nWhilst demand for private label products remains strong, there are signs that private label market share has stabilised at current levels. In light of continuing inflationary pressures, many retailers are seeking value to support their consumer proposition with an increased requirement for cost out actions to support lower market pricing.\nThe Group continued its focus on net debt reduction resulting in net debt closing at \u00a3105.2m, a \u00a326.3m reduction\nversus the prior year end (30 June 2024: \u00a3131.5m), representing a net debt cover level of 1.2x.\nOn 17 January 2025, the Group announced that it intends to reinstate annual dividends in relation to the current financial year. Details will be announced at the same time as the Group's full-year results on 17 September 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMcBride plc\nChris Smith, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Strickland, Chief Financial Officer\nInstinctif Partners\n020 7457 2020\nHannah Scott\nAugustine Chipungu\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "congratulations mallard on a truly comprehensive analysis. i am concerned that we are not able to see the wood for the trees. the issue here is that we have a business on a p/e of 5.4 which has barriers to entry and which is stable albeit operating  on a margin of only 3%. the macro economic threat is often mentioned but i think this is a red herring because economic pressures will stimulate economy brand sales. over the last eight years growth has been almost exactly the same as inflation. any switch to dosage packaging has not improved margins. there are however other prospects: 1) ultimately the pension scheme will end as will top-ups (\u00a34m) and actuarial losses (\u00a34m). over eight years there has been no improvement here; the deficit remains the same ~\u00a330m. there is an additional threat here from virgin media versus ntl which will impact 2016 obligations of \u00a3150m. there is no estimate of this so say 5%? whilst the pension situation is at best unchanged the turnover is up by a third. 2) the debt shows no obvious trend at around \u00a3130m. the outstanding position here is that in y/e 2022 there was a massive hit to profits because the energy crisis was not covered by provisions to increase prices. long term finance costs of about \u00a36m shot up to around \u00a320m. the problem looking forward is that finance costs will be impacted by rising interest rates. (interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.  I think that the P/E should be at least 10 indicating a share price of 230p.",

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts?

You have not discussed whether the Board's record of making low risk shareholder value accretive small infill type acquisitions (either for new product or for new geography).  I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same. The only other things I can think of are the unpredictable unknowns - will WW3 start in the Middle East and cause the Suez canal to be closed and energy costs to go through the roof, destroying MCB's margins?  No idea on that. Stockopedia gives us a speculative risk rating.  That needs to change soon to the lower one of \"adventurous\".  I think your post has changed sentiment here!  ATB.",

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%. Yet despite rallying c.30% since November the stock is still trading on only 5.7x cal 2026 PER and we see scope for a significant rerating towards our 235p Fair Value (equivalent to a c.6% cal 26 FCF yield).",

That translates, on huge sales, into a decent ROCE on such a small asset base.  Sure, you can't expect big OMs selling to financially more powerful customers, but as the net debt and the pension deficit fall (payments into the latter to rise sharply from October?), the net assets should rise considerably, and falling interest rates too should help.  Forward PE of nearly 5, admittedly with a  flat to small volume growth profile, seems cheap unless you are expecting closure of the Suez Canal and WWIII to start. Indeed, Yahoo Finance shows a consensus analysts' price target of about \u00a31.04.  In about a year's time, the share price should be past that.  JMV. No advice intended. P.S. Once the debt falls and the net assets rise decently, Paul Scott and Graham Neary of Stockopedia will adjust the risk rating back to adventurous - they were asleep on the job increasing the risk rating to \"speculative\", so don't expect them to do the reverse in a timely fashion.",

However, after nearly two and a half years of rapidly rising prices, it could take a bit longer for shoppers to unwind the habits they have learnt to help them manage the cost of living crisis.  Own-label lines are proving resilient, for example, and they are still growing faster than brands, making up over half (52%) of total spending.  Sales of premium own label ranges continue to increase too, up by 9.9% compared with a year ago.\"",

          "content": "congratulations mallard on a truly comprehensive analysis. i am concerned that we are not able to see the wood for the trees. the issue here is that we have a business on a p/e of 5.4 which has barriers to entry and which is stable albeit operating  on a margin of only 3%. the macro economic threat is often mentioned but i think this is a red herring because economic pressures will stimulate economy brand sales. over the last eight years growth has been almost exactly the same as inflation. any switch to dosage packaging has not improved margins. there are however other prospects: 1) ultimately the pension scheme will end as will top-ups (\u00a34m) and actuarial losses (\u00a34m). over eight years there has been no improvement here; the deficit remains the same ~\u00a330m. there is an additional threat here from virgin media versus ntl which will impact 2016 obligations of \u00a3150m. there is no estimate of this so say 5%? whilst the pension situation is at best unchanged the turnover is up by a third. 2) the debt shows no obvious trend at around \u00a3130m. the outstanding position here is that in y/e 2022 there was a massive hit to profits because the energy crisis was not covered by provisions to increase prices. long term finance costs of about \u00a36m shot up to around \u00a320m. the problem looking forward is that finance costs will be impacted by rising interest rates. (interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

          "content": "The trading update was essentially steady ahead as she goes. A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.  I think that the P/E should be at least 10 indicating a share price of 230p.",

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts? Are we missing something?",

MarketScreener shows the eps forecasts have been trimmed a bit (1p off the 2025 and 2027 forecasts, and I cannot see if the 2026 forecast has been trimmed: the graph showing the change to the 2027 forecast obscures any possible change to the 2026 forecast.  On my source of Factset Research consensus forecasts (from a different web site, the forecasts have remained unchanged or have not yet been updated. Have you missed anything?  You have not discussed whether the Board's record of making low risk shareholder value accretive small infill type acquisitions (either for new product or for new geography).  I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same. The only other things I can think of are the unpredictable unknowns - will WW3 start in the Middle East and cause the Suez canal to be closed and energy costs to go through the roof, destroying MCB's margins?  No idea on that. Stockopedia gives us a speculative risk rating.  That needs to change soon to the lower one of \"adventurous\".  I think your post has changed sentiment here!  ATB.",

          "content": "Could not post this on ADVFN as sometimes I get the \"contact support message if the problem persists\" My  takeaways on yesterday\u2019s presentation to private investors  (not perfect, I cannot remember everything so help from others would be appreciated) are: Operating margin matters, and our directors will make sure it is maintained (although it is complex what with changes in mix of sales causing switches, say, to lower value products, etc.) but they point out there are product engineering solutions to deal with margin preservation, and their \"partners\" value what McBride do.  There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.  The listing rules around buybacks  seem to me to be designed not to cause a false market in the shares, so buybacks are not always the magic thing to stop a share price falling if there is say an earnings downgrade, I wonder?",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

(Good to know he won't do them at any old price, as some people get bamboozled by the accounting treatment of buybacks making buybacks look like a shareholder-value neutral operation (like dividends leaving the company) when of course buybacks are not, even if the accounting treatment makes them look like they are.  Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.  The listing rules around buybacks  seem to me to be designed not to cause a false market in the shares, so buybacks are not always the magic thing to stop a share price falling if there is say an earnings downgrade, I wonder?",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

That translates, on huge sales, into a decent ROCE on such a small asset base.  Sure, you can't expect big OMs selling to financially more powerful customers, but as the net debt and the pension deficit fall (payments into the latter to rise sharply from October?), the net assets should rise considerably, and falling interest rates too should help.  Forward PE of nearly 5, admittedly with a  flat to small volume growth profile, seems cheap unless you are expecting closure of the Suez Canal and WWIII to start. Indeed, Yahoo Finance shows a consensus analysts' price target of about \u00a31.04.  In about a year's time, the share price should be past that.  JMV. No advice intended. P.S. Once the debt falls and the net assets rise decently, Paul Scott and Graham Neary of Stockopedia will adjust the risk rating back to adventurous - they were asleep on the job increasing the risk rating to \"speculative\", so don't expect them to do the reverse in a timely fashion.",

If the company can maintain its performance of July-December 2023 then we have a fabulous deleverage story over the next 3 years. This stock has been held back by low profit margins, high debt levels and pension deficit concerns for too long. All 3 of these factors seem to have been addressed and the near future looks bright. Strong arguments can be made for the share price being nearer \u00a32 than \u00a31 within 18-24 months if management continues to deliver. We doubled our stake this morning. DYOR.",

However, after nearly two and a half years of rapidly rising prices, it could take a bit longer for shoppers to unwind the habits they have learnt to help them manage the cost of living crisis.  Own-label lines are proving resilient, for example, and they are still growing faster than brands, making up over half (52%) of total spending.  Sales of premium own label ranges continue to increase too, up by 9.9% compared with a year ago.\"",

          "content": "congratulations mallard on a truly comprehensive analysis. i am concerned that we are not able to see the wood for the trees. the issue here is that we have a business on a p/e of 5.4 which has barriers to entry and which is stable albeit operating  on a margin of only 3%. the macro economic threat is often mentioned but i think this is a red herring because economic pressures will stimulate economy brand sales. over the last eight years growth has been almost exactly the same as inflation. any switch to dosage packaging has not improved margins. there are however other prospects: 1) ultimately the pension scheme will end as will top-ups (\u00a34m) and actuarial losses (\u00a34m). over eight years there has been no improvement here; the deficit remains the same ~\u00a330m. there is an additional threat here from virgin media versus ntl which will impact 2016 obligations of \u00a3150m. there is no estimate of this so say 5%? whilst the pension situation is at best unchanged the turnover is up by a third. 2) the debt shows no obvious trend at around \u00a3130m. the outstanding position here is that in y/e 2022 there was a massive hit to profits because the energy crisis was not covered by provisions to increase prices. long term finance costs of about \u00a36m shot up to around \u00a320m. the problem looking forward is that finance costs will be impacted by rising interest rates. (interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.  I think that the P/E should be at least 10 indicating a share price of 230p.",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%. Yet despite rallying c.30% since November the stock is still trading on only 5.7x cal 2026 PER and we see scope for a significant rerating towards our 235p Fair Value (equivalent to a c.6% cal 26 FCF yield).",

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

(Good to know he won't do them at any old price, as some people get bamboozled by the accounting treatment of buybacks making buybacks look like a shareholder-value neutral operation (like dividends leaving the company) when of course buybacks are not, even if the accounting treatment makes them look like they are.  Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.  The listing rules around buybacks  seem to me to be designed not to cause a false market in the shares, so buybacks are not always the magic thing to stop a share price falling if there is say an earnings downgrade, I wonder?",

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

On my source of Factset Research consensus forecasts (from a different web site, the forecasts have remained unchanged or have not yet been updated. Have you missed anything?  You have not discussed whether the Board's record of making low risk shareholder value accretive small infill type acquisitions (either for new product or for new geography).  I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same. The only other things I can think of are the unpredictable unknowns - will WW3 start in the Middle East and cause the Suez canal to be closed and energy costs to go through the roof, destroying MCB's margins?  No idea on that. Stockopedia gives us a speculative risk rating.  That needs to change soon to the lower one of \"adventurous\".  I think your post has changed sentiment here!  ATB.",

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts? Are we missing something?",

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.

(interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%.

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

If that wansnt low enough to commence a buyback then what share price is in the Cfos opinion ?

(Good to know he won't do them at any old price, as some people get bamboozled by the accounting treatment of buybacks making buybacks look like a shareholder-value neutral operation (like dividends leaving the company) when of course buybacks are not, even if the accounting treatment makes them look like they are.  Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.  The listing rules around buybacks  seem to me to be designed not to cause a false market in the shares, so buybacks are not always the magic thing to stop a share price falling if there is say an earnings downgrade, I wonder?",

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

You have not discussed whether the Board's record of making low risk shareholder value accretive small infill type acquisitions (either for new product or for new geography).  I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same. The only other things I can think of are the unpredictable unknowns - will WW3 start in the Middle East and cause the Suez canal to be closed and energy costs to go through the roof, destroying MCB's margins?  No idea on that. Stockopedia gives us a speculative risk rating.  That needs to change soon to the lower one of \"adventurous\".  I think your post has changed sentiment here!  ATB.",

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts? Are we missing something?",

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.

(interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%.

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

If that wansnt low enough to commence a buyback then what share price is in the Cfos opinion ? It seems a little inefficient putting 5m of capital into a divi then a share buyback which would put multiples of 3p on the company Feels a little wlly  dilly the reasoning given the divi and they\u2019ve just issued themselves a nice 1.2 millions shares tbis Morning Since may 2024 there has been negative performance in the share price from the mid 140s so even patient holders have not been really rewarded",

(Good to know he won't do them at any old price, as some people get bamboozled by the accounting treatment of buybacks making buybacks look like a shareholder-value neutral operation (like dividends leaving the company) when of course buybacks are not, even if the accounting treatment makes them look like they are.  Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.  The listing rules around buybacks  seem to me to be designed not to cause a false market in the shares, so buybacks are not always the magic thing to stop a share price falling if there is say an earnings downgrade, I wonder?",

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts? Are we missing something?",

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.  I think that the P/E should be at least 10 indicating a share price of 230p.",

          "content": "congratulations mallard on a truly comprehensive analysis. i am concerned that we are not able to see the wood for the trees. the issue here is that we have a business on a p/e of 5.4 which has barriers to entry and which is stable albeit operating  on a margin of only 3%. the macro economic threat is often mentioned but i think this is a red herring because economic pressures will stimulate economy brand sales. over the last eight years growth has been almost exactly the same as inflation. any switch to dosage packaging has not improved margins. there are however other prospects: 1) ultimately the pension scheme will end as will top-ups (\u00a34m) and actuarial losses (\u00a34m). over eight years there has been no improvement here; the deficit remains the same ~\u00a330m. there is an additional threat here from virgin media versus ntl which will impact 2016 obligations of \u00a3150m. there is no estimate of this so say 5%? whilst the pension situation is at best unchanged the turnover is up by a third. 2) the debt shows no obvious trend at around \u00a3130m. the outstanding position here is that in y/e 2022 there was a massive hit to profits because the energy crisis was not covered by provisions to increase prices. long term finance costs of about \u00a36m shot up to around \u00a320m. the problem looking forward is that finance costs will be impacted by rising interest rates. (interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%. Yet despite rallying c.30% since November the stock is still trading on only 5.7x cal 2026 PER and we see scope for a significant rerating towards our 235p Fair Value (equivalent to a c.6% cal 26 FCF yield).",

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same.

Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts?

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased?

          "content": "congratulations mallard on a truly comprehensive analysis. i am concerned that we are not able to see the wood for the trees. the issue here is that we have a business on a p/e of 5.4 which has barriers to entry and which is stable albeit operating  on a margin of only 3%. the macro economic threat is often mentioned but i think this is a red herring because economic pressures will stimulate economy brand sales. over the last eight years growth has been almost exactly the same as inflation. any switch to dosage packaging has not improved margins. there are however other prospects: 1) ultimately the pension scheme will end as will top-ups (\u00a34m) and actuarial losses (\u00a34m). over eight years there has been no improvement here; the deficit remains the same ~\u00a330m. there is an additional threat here from virgin media versus ntl which will impact 2016 obligations of \u00a3150m. there is no estimate of this so say 5%? whilst the pension situation is at best unchanged the turnover is up by a third. 2) the debt shows no obvious trend at around \u00a3130m. the outstanding position here is that in y/e 2022 there was a massive hit to profits because the energy crisis was not covered by provisions to increase prices. long term finance costs of about \u00a36m shot up to around \u00a320m. the problem looking forward is that finance costs will be impacted by rising interest rates. (interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

          "content": "\"Sustained private label momentum\" - research freely accessible here: https://www.equitydevelopment.co.uk/research/sustained-private-label-momentum McBride\u2019s H126 trading update confirms that demand for private label cleaning products remains at high levels, with volume growth of 0.4% and total sales growth of 0.8%. Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%. Yet despite rallying c.30% since November the stock is still trading on only 5.7x cal 2026 PER and we see scope for a significant rerating towards our 235p Fair Value (equivalent to a c.6% cal 26 FCF yield).",

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.

Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

On my source of Factset Research consensus forecasts (from a different web site, the forecasts have remained unchanged or have not yet been updated. Have you missed anything?  You have not discussed whether the Board's record of making low risk shareholder value accretive small infill type acquisitions (either for new product or for new geography).  I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same. The only other things I can think of are the unpredictable unknowns - will WW3 start in the Middle East and cause the Suez canal to be closed and energy costs to go through the roof, destroying MCB's margins?  No idea on that. Stockopedia gives us a speculative risk rating.  That needs to change soon to the lower one of \"adventurous\".  I think your post has changed sentiment here!  ATB.",

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts?

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.

(interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj.

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",

If that wansnt low enough to commence a buyback then what share price is in the Cfos opinion ?

(Good to know he won't do them at any old price, as some people get bamboozled by the accounting treatment of buybacks making buybacks look like a shareholder-value neutral operation (like dividends leaving the company) when of course buybacks are not, even if the accounting treatment makes them look like they are.  Sorry for the lecture: I have a bee in my bonnet about this topic.  The listing rules around buybacks  seem to me to be designed not to cause a false market in the shares, so buybacks are not always the magic thing to stop a share price falling if there is say an earnings downgrade, I wonder?",

There are now quarterly review procedures on contracts to amend them (by mutual consent?) to take account of cost headwinds.  Partners have differing requirements all the time: one minute it is more perfume additives, another it is packaging changes, etc. and it just happens that cost-outs are flavour of the month for now. Debt paydown is no longer such a pressing priority, so similar falls of \u00a326.3m to that in the period just reported on will, in the current accounting period, be a bit unlikely to be repeated: they are looking for growth investment opportunities with a payback period of 2 years or less (sounds shareholder value accretive to me).  Our CFO comes from a private equity background, which to me seems important in making the right acquisitions.  Buying existing businesses is maybe less risky than building a whole new factory from scratch, I wonder? The risk of hackers disrupting our business, the way M&S has suffered, is being managed appropriately. Chris Smith outlined a strategy they are concentrating on.  I could go into detail but it is maybe unwise to if the company doesn't publish yesterday's chat. The company has not built up a maintenance capex backlog in paying down debt as quickly as it has.  They said it was difficult to separate growth and maintenance capex because replacing a machine with a new one often involved a bit of both. Liquids are expensive to transport, so the factories that make these need to be close to where their partners are.  It is different with dishwasher tablets, etc. Contract manufacturing for the branders is important: it covers the (fixed cost?) overheads. The remaining \u00a345m of Transformation benefits still to come will be weighted to the 2028 accounting period (\u00a320m in that one).  The rest will come in the other accounting periods before then, \u00a35m in the current one. The accordion facility will help finance acquisitions, I wonder? The company is quite different from before: the new operating model seems to be responsible for a change in the previous falling sales trend and the \u201coperating margins all over the place\u201d problem.  CS believes the business is much more stable now, and the top line is more stable now.  The new operating model seems to have many advantages over the one before.  JMV.

On my source of Factset Research consensus forecasts (from a different web site, the forecasts have remained unchanged or have not yet been updated. Have you missed anything?  You have not discussed whether the Board's record of making low risk shareholder value accretive small infill type acquisitions (either for new product or for new geography).  I do not know the company well enough to know its record on that, and I have never discussed what WACC they use to decide on whether a possible acquisition would be shareholder value accretive or not, something I should ask about at the next AGM. I think it is right that one analyst has reduced their turnover forecast slightly in response to the trading update, while keeping eps the same. The only other things I can think of are the unpredictable unknowns - will WW3 start in the Middle East and cause the Suez canal to be closed and energy costs to go through the roof, destroying MCB's margins?  No idea on that. Stockopedia gives us a speculative risk rating.  That needs to change soon to the lower one of \"adventurous\".  I think your post has changed sentiment here!  ATB.",

Clearly the market doesn't like the flat-lining top line (sales up less than 1% on a constant currency basis 2024-2025). But: 1. Good cash flow generation. Net debt down \u00a326m over the past 12 months, so presumably net debt could be paid down to zero in 4 years if management prioritised this (over dividends, capex, M&A etc). 2. Net debt of \u00a3105m isn't ridiculous when adjusted EBITDA is \u00a387m. 3. PE ratio of 5.5x seems like bargain basement. 4. Ditto EV:EBITDA around 3.6x. Not much else in the sector available at these multiples. 5. Pension deficit seems manageable. 6. Clear transformation of this company over the past few years. 7. Possible recommencement of dividends in the near future (though we'd rather net debt was paid down). 8. Contract manufacturing growth strong. Should help admittedly low net profit margin. We're tempted to buy this one and file it away in the proverbial locked drawer. Bank future modest dividends and watch on as EBITDA nudges up to \u00a3100m in 3-5 years and net debt declines steadily. Should be a rerating of multiples at some point and maybe a 2x. Thoughts? Are we missing something?",

On a flat run rate of 21p eps, the company should be able to pay off \u00a330m of debt each year and still keep the company the same size (i.e. keep capex equal to depreciation charge), where \u00a330m of debt pay down adds, say, 18p per share p.a. assuming enterprise value remains about the same.  The lower debt servicing costs will help keep eps the same while revenue drops a bit due to supermarkets demanding cost-outs. With an earnings yield of 18% in prospect at the current share price, what is not to like about that? Buffet probably only does about 20% consistently year in year out. Okay, so the two Pauls (Hill and Scott of Vox Markets) don't like anything with operating margins less than 30%, ROCEs less than 30% and FCF growth rates in excess of 30% p.a. so they are never going to like MCB, but if MCB can compound earnings at 18%, I will not grumble. As to complaining about the high price to book, the author maybe does not get it that when you nearly wipe out almost all the equity and then have a strong eps recovery that the price to book rises a lot initially (mega share price rise to reflect sudden return to profitability while net assets remain low): a few more years of 21p eps will soon see the price to book come down as equity replaces the debt component of EV to give a more 'attractive' price to book, an 'attractive' price to book when you have missed out on the massive share price rise.",

A very forthright update with the only qualification being around the question \"What were internal expectations?\" I was expecting profits to be slightly down. What strikes me about this business is that it is now amazingly stable. The energy shock was a once off occurring because there were no price hike clauses. There are however some negatives in the trading update: It demonstrates that contract manufacturing serves only to cover admin and depreciation charges and presumably generates trivial profit. This leaves us with growth of 2.4% which is by no means trivial for brands. However has the pack size increased? So the story with this is slow but steady growth combined with significant improvements in financing and pension liabilities.

(interest rate increases hit highly geared businesses such as this.) overall the finance situation is positive because expectations are worse than the likely worst outcome. 3) y/e 2024 showed a massive rise in gross profit which had been steady at around \u00a3240m but which shot up to \u00a3347.9m. the probable main cause of this was that energy costs fell back again not offset by contract prices. on the other hand the 2024 report was very bullish in its prospects and this indicates that there is also a long term improvement. the november trading update had y/e 2025 expectations of adjusted operating profit down by 7.4m presumably it is possible to predict the figure so accurately because all contracts run six months in advance. this would suggest an earnings figure of \u00a325m giving a forward p/e of 7.2. so the 2024 jump in profits of \u00a321m might be say: \u00a310 energy cost fallback + \u00a37m finance improvement + \u00a34m operational growth. overall this is positive. the question remains: why is such a good business so cheap? why is the share price falling? what are the possible threats? the risks and uncertainties listed in the annual report look pretty bull****ty to me! do you have any other ideas?",

Moreover, McBride continues to win new contracts leading to management\u2019s confidence in achieving FY26E expectations of Adj. EBIT of c. \u00a364m. High levels of private label penetration were sustained across Europe\u2019s largest markets in McBride\u2019s H126 and despite some pressure on average selling prices, profitability has been sustained through product engineering and excellent cost control and service. New contract wins across divisions underpin the positive outlook for H226 (and beyond) and management is confident in meeting consensus expectations for FY26E of c.\u00a364m Adj. EBIT. ROCE has sustained a jump to 32%-33% and net debt is only 1.4x EBITDA. Dividends were reinstated in FY25 and having announced a \u00a320m share buyback last November, we raise our Adj. EPS forecasts by 7%-8%.

The covenant gearing (ratio of Net debt to EBITDA?) on MCG is 3x but is expected to drop to 2.5x by year end (receipt of NASB sale proceeds after H1 end).  The same leverage covenant on MCB at its worst was not to surpass 3x if I recall correctly (it is in that RNS, a few years back, about MCB's new financing agreement after its input costs rocketed).  What we want on MCG is some organic deleveraging, not more asset sales.  I don't think we are going to see any further improvement in MCG's covenant gearing until about 2028, but if it does fall from 2.5x due to organic deleveraging, then the share price rise on MCG could be pretty decent.  I don't know what the outcome will be on MCG - I suppose if I am honest it could go either way.  I think your point about the euro denominated profits turning into more pounds from Alsa is an excellent point (a reason to buy as Labour will screw up the UK economy - they are not listening to Dr Laffer).  I take no notice of Firepower - he has confused share price outcome on a single stock with quality of investment decision making - some of the best posters on MCG (and best takers of investment decisions on MCG) may well have large losses at present on that stock (I do!). I look at a poster's understanding of the business model and the accounts, not whether they have a profit or a loss to date.  Rob295, as do others, seem to have a good understanding of it.  Transport is a new sector for me.  Fingers crossed MCG comes good.",

They deny having a maintenance capex backlog, yet the eps growth forecast is not great (4%?), the payout ratio is low, and they also seem content with current debt levels, although net debt is forecast to drop from \u00a3105m to \u00a360m by June 2028, so what is the growth capex doing? Nothing, it seems. But all this is already discounted in the low forward PE, so if they did announce a shareholder-value-accretive acquisition, the share price ought to get closer to that broker target of about \u00a31.90. Agreed the award of so many shares is not great, but as Charlie Munger said \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\".  This is a great opportunity for them to buy back Teleios' shares for cancellation to undo those massive share awards. Another company with flat growth prospects, low payout ratio on a low forward PE, just like MCB, is FUTR, a content publishing business.",

Adj. EBITDA margins have risen above 9%, and been sustained, driving excellent 30%+ ROCE and cash generation. In this detailed report we review the attractive investment thesis for McBride and conclude its current low valuation is an anomaly. We initiate coverage with a 235p Fair Value equating to 10x PER, 6x EV/EBITDA and a c.6% FCF yield (cal 2026). As a result of the group\u2019s improved profitability, ROCE has jumped to 32%-33% and net debt has fallen to just 1.2x EBITDA. In addition, dividends have been reinstated, starting at 3p for FY25. Yet despite this, McBride is trading on only c.5x PER. This is at odds with the wider consumer sector where we see stocks with similar metrics trading on at least 10x PER. Hence we believe that as confidence in the sustainability of McBride\u2019s profits grows, its shares will re-rate significantly.",

It may sharpen up what you want to hear in a presentation, and then maybe such presentations will be less of a drag \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The only problem with the book in recommending stocks with persistently high ROCEs (a sign of efficient capital allocation), persistently high operating margins (a sign of pricing power), persistently high FCF growth (a business model that allows growth without requiring huge capex to grow) is that shares in such companies are likely to be priced accordingly so no point in buying them.  The answer maybe is to buy them at a time of crisis but that will be hard to do because the newspaper headlines will be warning about the end of the world, the problem of doing the opposite of what the herd are doing, and then there is the problem of having the cash pile just at the right time to exploit the situation to your advantage.  Still the book is worth reading.  Hope this helps.",
