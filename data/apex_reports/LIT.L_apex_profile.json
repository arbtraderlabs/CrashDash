Furthermore, the debt covenant waiver from Northleaf that was due to expire at the end of January 2026 has been extended to 1 March 2026.

There is no additional one-time waiver fee in relation to this extension.\nThe Strategic Review that was first announced on 15 September 2025 continues to progress and this waiver extension is reflective of Northleaf's ongoing support while LCM works towards a long-term resolution of its capital position.

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest.\nPoland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026.\nLCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern (Corporate Broking)\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Judgment also required the claimant to meet the costs of Stanwell Corporation Ltd and CS Energy Ltd incurred in defending the QLD Electricity Claim. These costs have now been quantified as follows:\n1. A$16.2 million payable to Stanwell Corporation Ltd; and\n2. A$16.2 million payable to CS Energy Ltd.\nLCM has a policy of ATE insurance available to cover adverse costs for this case. After full use of this insurance policy there is an uninsured component of A$19.9 million which exposes LCM to a payment of A$12.9 million with the remainder to be paid by Fund 1 investors.\nAs announced on 28 February 2025, an appeal has been filed against the Judgment. That appeal has been set down for hearing for two weeks commencing on 2 March 2026. LCM is also giving consideration to the claimant bringing a separate appeal against the quantification of these costs.\nLCM continues to be in proactive conversations with its principal lender. The Strategic Review that was first announced on 15 September 2025 remains ongoing and management will provide an update on its progress in the new year.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM commented\n:\n\"This is a very expensive and complicated piece of litigation which has resulted in large cost orders in favour of the respondents. This quantification was of ordinary and not indemnity costs orders and so are not a reflection of the conduct of the claimant or LCM or of the strength of the claim.\"\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern (Corporate Broking)\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
