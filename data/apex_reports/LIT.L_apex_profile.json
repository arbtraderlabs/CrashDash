Furthermore, the debt covenant waiver from Northleaf that was due to expire at the end of January 2026 has been extended to 1 March 2026. During the extended waiver period the interest on the loan remains increased by 2.00% per annum consistent with the initial waiver. There is no additional one-time waiver fee in relation to this extension.\nThe Strategic Review that was first announced on 15 September 2025 continues to progress and this waiver extension is reflective of Northleaf's ongoing support while LCM works towards a long-term resolution of its capital position.

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest.\nPoland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026.\nLCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern (Corporate Broking)\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Judgment also required the claimant to meet the costs of Stanwell Corporation Ltd and CS Energy Ltd incurred in defending the QLD Electricity Claim. These costs have now been quantified as follows:\n1. A$16.2 million payable to Stanwell Corporation Ltd; and\n2. A$16.2 million payable to CS Energy Ltd.\nLCM has a policy of ATE insurance available to cover adverse costs for this case. After full use of this insurance policy there is an uninsured component of A$19.9 million which exposes LCM to a payment of A$12.9 million with the remainder to be paid by Fund 1 investors.\nAs announced on 28 February 2025, an appeal has been filed against the Judgment. That appeal has been set down for hearing for two weeks commencing on 2 March 2026. LCM is also giving consideration to the claimant bringing a separate appeal against the quantification of these costs.\nLCM continues to be in proactive conversations with its principal lender. The Strategic Review that was first announced on 15 September 2025 remains ongoing and management will provide an update on its progress in the new year.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM commented\n:\n\"This is a very expensive and complicated piece of litigation which has resulted in large cost orders in favour of the respondents. This quantification was of ordinary and not indemnity costs orders and so are not a reflection of the conduct of the claimant or LCM or of the strength of the claim.\"\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern (Corporate Broking)\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest.\nPoland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026.\nLCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern (Corporate Broking)\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Judgment also required the claimant to meet the costs of Stanwell Corporation Ltd and CS Energy Ltd incurred in defending the QLD Electricity Claim. These costs have now been quantified as follows:\n1. A$16.2 million payable to Stanwell Corporation Ltd; and\n2. A$16.2 million payable to CS Energy Ltd.\nLCM has a policy of ATE insurance available to cover adverse costs for this case. After full use of this insurance policy there is an uninsured component of A$19.9 million which exposes LCM to a payment of A$12.9 million with the remainder to be paid by Fund 1 investors.\nAs announced on 28 February 2025, an appeal has been filed against the Judgment. That appeal has been set down for hearing for two weeks commencing on 2 March 2026. LCM is also giving consideration to the claimant bringing a separate appeal against the quantification of these costs.\nLCM continues to be in proactive conversations with its principal lender. The Strategic Review that was first announced on 15 September 2025 remains ongoing and management will provide an update on its progress in the new year.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM commented\n:\n\"This is a very expensive and complicated piece of litigation which has resulted in large cost orders in favour of the respondents.

The first is direct investments made from LCM's permanent balance sheet capital and the second is third party fund management. Under those two business models, LCM currently pursues three investment strategies: Single-case funding, Portfolio funding and Acquisitions of claims.

Currently headquartered in Sydney, with offices in London and Singapore, LCM listed on AIM in December 2018, trading under the ticker LIT.\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nCEO Report\nThis year has been the most challenging in LCM's history. Despite our established long-term track record of successful outcomes and consistent returns on invested capital, an unprecedented number of adverse case results have negatively impacted our performance over the past 12 months. We recorded 6 wins against 6 losses in FY25, with a further 3 cases losing at trial during the period and now being under appeal. Disappointingly, several of the adverse outcomes were for cases where we had invested significant shareholder capital. While these results are reflective of the inherent binary risk in our asset class, they have fallen well short of our expectations and historical benchmarks.\nPost-year-end, we announced the termination of our investment in the Gladstone class action in Australia, which was initiated in 2018. In our view, the expert evidence was insufficient to support the case theory and we therefore took the difficult decision to terminate rather than incur significant further trial-related costs. The settlement includes payment of costs, fully covered by After-the-Event Insurance, and we are pursuing potential recoveries through a costs assessment and a negligence claim against the initial solicitors.\nWhile these setbacks have tested our resilience, they have also provided valuable insights. We are committed to applying the lessons learned to strengthen our operations, refine our strategy, and reposition LCM for long-term recovery.\nLessons Learned\nAs LCM has grown, expanded internationally, and transitioned into a funds management business, my role as CEO has evolved to meet the demands of this transformation. Previously centred on managing legal investments through daily engagement with solicitors, barristers, and independent experts, my foc",

This decision to terminate this investment comes as a result of LCM's review of its portfolio of investments following recent adverse case outcomes with a focus on balance sheet discipline and efficient deployment of capital.\nThe effect of LCM's termination of this investment is that the class action has been settled on the basis of a full release between the parties of all claims and a payment to Gladstone Ports Corporation relating to a portion of its costs. The settlement is subject to Court approval which will be heard in the week of 27 October 2025. The payment to Gladstone Ports Corporation will be fully covered by a policy of After the Event Insurance.\nThe investment was held on LCM's balance sheet at an amount of A$30.8 million (\u00a315.0 million), which is equal to the cash invested into the case, and will now be written off.\nThe review of this investment has identified two avenues for potential recovery of a material part of LCM's capital invested. Firstly, we believe that the firm of solicitors, who initially acted for the claimants in this claim, overcharged for legal services supplied to the claimants and we have commenced a costs assessment seeking reimbursement of a portion of the legal costs paid by LCM. Secondly, we are investigating a claim against those same solicitors for breach of contract and negligence in association with the legal services provided for the claim.\nStrategic Review\nFor some time, LCM has been actively evaluating its strategic options and this process has now progressed into a formal strategic review. To support this effort, LCM has appointed Luminis Partners, a leading financial and corporate advisory firm, to provide independent expertise and guide the review.\nFurther Case Updates\nLCM is awaiting the outcome of a trial in relation to a separate investment in UK commercial litigation, co-funded alongside Fund I, into which LCM has invested A$20.6 million (\u00a39.9 million) of its own capital. The judgment is expected within the next three weeks and LCM will provide an update as soon as it is available.\nFurthermore, having previously sought permission to appeal the commercial arbitration loss that we announced on 1 April 2025, we expect to hear if permission has been granted in the near term and will update the market accordingly.\nFull Year Results\nManagement will present the 2025 financial year results to the market on 1 October 2025. As noted in a prior RNS released on 19 June 2025, management will provide a strategic and financial update reflecting on recent developments and outlining the Company's forward priorities.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM commented\n:\n\"The termination of the Gladstone class action investment was a challenging but necessary decision, as ultimately the way in which the claim was prepared and aspects of the expert evidence were insufficient to support the case theory. This action, alongside recent cost reduction efforts that we have taken and the formal strategic review, reflects our proactive approach to navigating recent challenges.\"\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nc/o Tavistock PR\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7523 8000\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern and Jamie Anderson (Corporate Broking)\nCanaccord Genuity\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7597 5970\nBobbie Hilliam\nTavistock PR\nTel:\u00a0020 7920 3150\nKatie Hopkins\nSimon Hudson\nlcm@tavistock.co.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nLitigation Capital Management (LCM) is an alternative asset manager specialising in disputes financing solutions internationally, which operates two business models.

This announcement also includes a trading update for the financial year ending 30 June 2025.\nFunded Case Judgment\nThe Judgment found against LCM's funded party. The investment was co-funded alongside Fund I. LCM contributed \u00a33.4m (A$7.2m) of its own capital with a further \u00a38.2m (A$17.2m) invested from Fund I.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the investment was recorded at a fair value of \u00a35.0m (A$10.1m) on LCM's balance sheet. Adverse costs risk is covered by ATE insurance. LCM is currently reviewing the judgment and assessing potential next steps alongside the funded party and legal representatives.\nTrading Update\nIn the second half of the financial year, the number of realisations has been modest with two successful investments and two unsuccessful investments in the period. These realisations in the second half exclude the Judgment noted above and the previously announced Queensland Electricity, Quintis and the commercial arbitration claim; all of which are either subject to appeal processes or considering appeal options.\nPeriod\nRealisations (A$m)\nInvested Capital\u00a0(A$m)\nMOIC multiple\nH1 25\n52\n14\n3.7x\nH2 25\n3\n5\n0.6x\nFY25\n55\n19\n2.9x\nNote: Invested Capital\u00a0reflects LCM's investment into the 13 concluded investments. It excludes Queensland Electricity, Quintis, the commercial arbitration and the UK litigation matter referenced above.\nNet debt is expected to be approximately A$73m at 30 June 2025 (FY24: A$8.9m), reflecting continued deployment into active cases and modest cash inflows during the period.\nLCM has received strong interest in Fund III from both existing and new investors. In light of uncertainty surrounding potential tax changes in the US litigation finance market, as well as political developments affecting certain institutional investors, notably US university endowments, LCM considers it prudent to temporarily pause active marketing of Fund III. While LCM has no direct exposure to US tax proposals, maintaining optionality in how we respond to further developments allows us to position the business advantageously as the external environment becomes clearer. We anticipate resuming marketing for Fund III in late 2025 or early 2026 and we remain flexible.\nIn light of this pause, and reflecting the Board's focus on balance sheet discipline following the recently announced trial losses, new commitments for FY25 are expected to be approximately A$80 million (FY24: A$270 million).\nManagement will provide a strategic update with the full year results in September, reflecting on recent developments and outlining the Company's forward priorities. This will include an assessment of the current portfolio, which contains a range of investments at different stages, including several larger matters that have the potential to positively impact future financial performance in a meaningful way.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM commented:\n\"\nThis has been a challenging period for LCM, marked by a small number of adverse case outcomes. While the recent trial losses are clearly disappointing, we are actively applying the lessons learned to further strengthen our investment and risk processes. As shareholders would expect, we analyse in detail the reasons for any adverse judgment LCM receives. I look forward to sharing those insights with our investors at our full year results presentation. Fund III marketing has been temporarily paused for the reasons noted but we retain flexibility to recommence that process. We are very pleased with the interest and enthusiasm shown to date by key investors. Our long-term confidence in the fundamentals of the dispute finance sector, and in LCM's differentiated model, remains intact.\"\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7523 8000\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern and Jamie Anderson (Corporate Broking)\nCanaccord Genuity (Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7597 5970\nBobbie Hilliam\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nLitigation Capital Management (LCM) is an alternative asset manager specialising in disputes financing solutions internationally, which operates two business models.

The subject matter, findings and funding terms remain confidential. As is typical in commercial arbitration, the avenues for appeal are limited. LCM is currently assessing potential next steps in collaboration with the funded party and legal representatives.\nThis investment was co-funded by Fund I. LCM has invested \u00a32.5m (A$5.1m) of its own capital into the case alongside \u00a37.5m (A$15.2m) of investment from Fund I. As of 31 December 2024, the investment was recorded at a fair value of \u00a317.0m (A$34.4m) from LCM's perspective inclusive of anticipated performance fees. This fair value was based among other factors on the advice of an independent Kings Counsel immediately before the hearing confirming both prospects of success and quantum. Importantly, LCM has no exposure to adverse costs, and Fund I's performance remains robust, with the Net Realised IRR standing at 35% post this unsuccessful investment.\nFair value accounting in legal finance reflects both the risk and potential rewards inherent in high-value commercial disputes. As cases progress towards resolution, fair value assessments may reflect significant multiples of invested capital. LCM continues to refine and enhance its valuation methodology to ensure a disciplined and consistent approach to the assessment of ongoing investments.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM commented\n:\n\"While this outcome is disappointing, we remain steadfast in our confidence in the strength of our broader portfolio. Legal finance inherently involves binary outcomes, and while this case did not deliver the expected result, our long-term track record demonstrates our ability to generate strong returns. We continue to believe in the substantial value embedded in our portfolio and remain focused on delivering successful outcomes for our investors.\"\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7523 8000\nJonny Franklin-Adams, Isaac Hooper and Rory Sale (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern and Jamie Anderson (Corporate Broking)\nCanaccord Genuity\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7597 5970\nBobbie Hilliam\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nLitigation Capital Management (LCM) is an alternative asset manager specialising in disputes financing solutions internationally, which operates two business models.

On the positive side, we secured significant wins in two investment treaty arbitration cases, where US$15 million of capital-deployed from both LCM's balance sheet and Fund I-generated awards exceeding US$400 million. LCM's share of these awards, across both capital sources, is approaching US$90 million, underscoring the exceptional returns we can deliver for our clients, fund investors, and shareholders. However, we also experienced setbacks, with two Australian class action investments losing at trial (both will be appealed). LCM has invested A$38m of its own capital into these cases to date and we expect any further investment to take these cases to appeal will be relatively modest.\nOur business is at an inflection point. Since embarking on our transition to a fund management model in 2020, we have made significant progress. Fund I (US$150 million) recently marked its fifth anniversary, delivering excellent performance. A comparison against the US private equity asset class, based on Cambridge Associates' extensive research, places Fund I in the top 5% of 2020 vintage funds across all key metrics. Fund II (US$291 million) has now closed to new commitments, with several cases in due diligence expected to bring it to 75-85% commitment.\nMarketing for Fund III is progressing strongly. We have received excellent engagement from both existing and ",

On a fair value basis, these realisations are expected to contribute A$4m to Total Income in the period as these cases collectively were held at a fair value of approximately A$48m prior to conclusion.\nFair value movements on ongoing cases are expected to contribute positively in the period to the value of A$1m. This is inclusive of a A$7m write-down of the fair value of the Queensland Electricity case following the trial loss announced on 4 December 2024.\nAfter accounting for operating expenses, finance costs, foreign exchange and tax in the first half we anticipate reporting a modest Loss After Tax of approximately A$8m (H1 FY24: Profit After Tax of A$7.3m).\nNet debt as of 31 December stood at A$40.1m (FY24: A$8.9m) primarily reflecting increased investment into ongoing cases. As announced by the Company on 2 December 2024, LCM entered into a new US$75m credit facility to support future growth.\nNew Commitments\nNew commitments in the first half of FY25 were A$25m (H1 FY24: A$90m). While the period saw fewer quality opportunities meeting our rigorous investment criteria, this ebb and flow of opportunities is not unusual, and we remain confident in future capital deployment prospects.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM , commented:\n\"While the first half of FY25 has been a period of mixed results, we are pleased with the strong realisations achieved and the ongoing progress of our portfolio. The high multiple on invested capital reflects the value we continue to generate from our disciplined approach to dispute financing. We remain confident in our ability to deploy capital effectively and to deliver attractive returns for our stakeholders as we move into the second half of the financial year.\"\nNotes\nThe figures in this RNS are all on an LCM-only basis.\nNotice of Results\nWe expect to report our interim results on 18 March 2025.\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nc/o Tavistock PR\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams, Isaac Hooper and Rory Sale (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern, Jamie Anderson (Corporate Broking)\nCanaccord (Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nLitigation Capital Management (LCM) is an alternative asset manager specialising in disputes financing solutions internationally, which operates two business models.

The new Credit Facility provides access to US$75 million in initial credit with the potential to upsize by a further US$75 million (up to US$150m in total).\nThe Credit Facility offers significant flexibility to drive LCM's growth strategy, supporting both direct investments and LCM's co-investments into cases funded alongside its managed funds business. It is secured against LCM's assets, is available for general corporate purposes, and has an overall term of four years.\nKey features of the Credit Facility include:\nMulti-currency availability\n: Available in USD, GBP, and AUD, the facility supports LCM's global financing needs.\nCost structure\n: Interest is set at the relevant central bank rate plus 5.25% (compared to central bank rate plus 8% for the prior facility) and is charged on the amount of the facility that has been drawn. Based on current central bank rates, this implies an interest rate below 10%. Unlike the prior facility, there is no profit participation in LCM's direct investments for the lender.\nDrawdown period and term\n: The Credit Facility has a four-year term, with the ability to draw down funds during the initial two years. It includes the usual financial covenants and reporting requirements typical of facilities of this nature.\nPatrick Moloney, CEO of LCM, commented\n:\n\"Securing this expanded Credit Facility is a significant step in LCM's growth journey. With this increased capital flexibility, we are well-positioned to scale our investment portfolio, capture new opportunities, and drive sustainable long-term growth.

Why bother doing the wind down work for faceless public shareholders, when you can do it out of the public spotlight, in private and aimed at solely feeding your own face. 3. The Chairman, CEO and other board members have proven themselves to be incompetent and wholly untrustworthy. They simply do not care a jot about anything other than their own pockets. We\u2019d have been better off keeping Nick Rowles Davies, the former alleged expenses thief who was previously on the board. At least he had the decency to get caught stealing! I say \u201cwe\u201d.

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

The management expressed surprise at the string of bad news,  caused either by their poor professional judgement (bad), or just statistical clustering in results (good). As there are over fifty cases, the statistical clustering is very unlikely. If the nature of the business is \"binary\" as they say and they win three times as many times as they lose, it is like drawing balls out of a bag, where there are three times as many winning balls as losing. Drawing a long string of losers is possible, but very unlikely. What is more likely is the usual story - management, drunk on early success, goes partying with the investment bankers and investors, while losing sight of the boring nitty-gritty of case work. And gets slapped on the nose. The million-dollar question is - the result of the damage. I can't answer this question, not even roughly.",

          "content": "If one were to pick the winners and losers in legal actions, using the pin method, one might expect to pick the winners 50% of the time, as there will be equal numbers of winners and losers.  Picking the winners 75% of the time, which is what the claim of winning three times as many cases as are lost means, would be impressive, if it were true.  This, however, is not the whole story, as there are no reliable statistics to show the percentage of plaintiffs who \"succeed\" or what \"success\" actually means.  All one can say is that given the risk of losing and the costs that would accrue therefrom, a plaintiff would need to be pretty confident of success to take the risk of suing a third party.  This would tend to skew the chances of winning, as far as any backer is concerned, toward the plaintiff.. The other issue is costs of losing versus the rewards from winning.  If, say, one were to invest $1m into each case, and win $2m on each success, a 50% success rate would mean that the winnings would be double the losses and, excluding company overheads, the company should be profitable.  LIT has, traditionally, claimed to win about three times its outlay on each case.  On this basis, with a 3:1 win to loss rate and a 3:1 fee to funding loss rate, the result should be akin to shooting fish in a barrel, generating a 9 to 1 return (assuming that cases have investment, which clearly they do not). A run of three bad cases is not statistically significant.  Think of picking red versus black at a roulette table: one can easily get it \"wrong\" three times in a row.  On that basis, provided the situation here is no more than a run of bad luck, there is no need to panic.  The matter of concern is the legal judgment that has been exercised, namely whether it has been competent.  If, as has been suggested, past successes have gone to the head and poor legal advice has been swallowed in a desire to fund an increasing number of cases, the future is not bright and one must hope that the promised review of cases results in a rapid and ruthless weeding out of all cases that are going \"pear shaped\". Time will tell how successful that will be but any news about abandoned cases might give us an idea of where the problem rests, ie luck versus hubris.",

If they run just one or two cases, then the results will swing wildly. The large diversification of cases can be likened to a large number of investments (frowned upon by Munger and Buffett, famously called \"diworsification\" by Peter Lynch) - keeping quality high and keeping track of all of them - is it even possible for a dynamic environment such as active law practice? \"Robust risk management\" and \"highly experienced team\" should ensure that the returns on capital endure. What we have here is an admitted fault of risk management, hence the \"strategic review\". To what extent the rot has spread they do not tell you. Prior statistics do not apply to the future, because the nature of cases changed, from hand-picked and hand-managed to a rag bag of who-knows-what. It could well be that the bad results will be just a blip, things are not that bad, and the company, having learned a painful lesson, will be stronger than ever. Or, large amounts of capital have been committed to losing bets, and it will take only a small bias to the lower quality of cases picked to wipe out the remaining equity. The risk may be acceptable for a punter with a few hundred bucks, but not to someone who is trying to \"ensure safety of the principal and an adequate return\" as per Benjamin Graham.",

          "content": "FROM THE ANNUAL RESULTS Going Concern - Material Uncertainty Given the number of adverse case outcomes in recent months, which have impacted cash inflows and increased indebtedness, the Directors have considered a range of scenarios, including plausible downside scenarios, and note that in certain circumstances, further case losses could lead to a breach of LCM's debt covenants. LCM's lender has granted a debt covenant waiver through to 30 December 2025 and as part of this arrangement the interest rate on the loan increases by 2.00% per annum during the waiver period, and a one-time waiver fee equal to 1.50% of the principal amount outstanding will be payable. While LCM's lender has been responsive in providing near-term covenant waivers to date, any further amendments, should they be required, will be subject to negotiation. This assessment is linked to a robust evaluation of the principal risks facing LCM and the potential impact of these risks being realised. After considering LCM's forecasts, stress testing and available mitigating actions, and having regard to the inherent risks associated with the binary nature of LCM's investment model, the Directors have concluded that a material uncertainty exists which may cast significant doubt on LCM's ability to continue as a going concern. The material uncertainty relates to LCM's ability to comply with its debt covenants in the event of certain adverse case outcomes. The Directors have a reasonable expectation, based on current discussions, that LCM will continue to receive the necessary support from its lender to allow it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, whilst noting the material uncertainty above.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed.

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage.

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award.

We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026.

LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

My guess is that company will get an offer sometime this month.

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Why bother doing the wind down work for faceless public shareholders, when you can do it out of the public spotlight, in private and aimed at solely feeding your own face. 3. The Chairman, CEO and other board members have proven themselves to be incompetent and wholly untrustworthy. They simply do not care a jot about anything other than their own pockets.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The company is already undergoing a strategic review, and a one month extension to the loan suggests to me that an offer is in an advanced state and that the lender is willing to grant just enough leeway to get an orderly sale. My guess is that company will get an offer sometime this month. What the price will be we can only guess, but given the distressed state that the company is, I think long-term shareholders are going to be disappointed.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims.

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

My rule was that if debt covenants did not get swiftly extended by mid Jan following the GRX update, or there was no communication on the strategic review then I had to get out. The poor return on GRX was the nail in the coffin for me and even future returns for next year or 2 may be hampered by the same performance clause and limit LCM's ability to get out of this situation. It's now the last trading day in Jan, covenants expire tomorrow, and LCM haven't assured the market, or provided an update on strategy. I think things are clearly very much on a tight rope here and one more bit of bad news is probably the end.",

Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

Furthermore, the debt covenant waiver from Northleaf that was due to expire at the end of January 2026 has been extended to 1 March 2026. During the extended waiver period the interest on the loan remains increased by 2.00% per annum consistent with the initial waiver. There is no additional one-time waiver fee in relation to this extension.\nThe Strategic Review that was first announced on 15 September 2025 continues to progress and this waiver extension is reflective of Northleaf's ongoing support while LCM works towards a long-term resolution of its capital position. LCM management will provide an update on the progress of the Strategic Review in due course.\nEnquiries\nLitigation Capital Management\nPatrick Moloney, Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Collins, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams and Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern (Corporate Broking)\nwww.lcmfinance.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

Looks like it is going to be a tense wait until the start of each month as to whether covenants have been waived.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

If the management and the lenders are aware and cool-headed enough to know this, they will keep their cool and continue with the business as usual. The stock price, however, will yo-yo wildly, as the stockmarket is famously short-sighted. Yes, having a ton of liquidity and/or very understanding lenders/funders is a must for a business like LIT. And very strong stomach for wild stock price fluctuations. The litigation industry is forecast to grow, the management and the company have a very strong track record, if the lenders don't panic, LIT will recover, and then some.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Why bother doing the wind down work for faceless public shareholders, when you can do it out of the public spotlight, in private and aimed at solely feeding your own face. 3. The Chairman, CEO and other board members have proven themselves to be incompetent and wholly untrustworthy. They simply do not care a jot about anything other than their own pockets.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The company is already undergoing a strategic review, and a one month extension to the loan suggests to me that an offer is in an advanced state and that the lender is willing to grant just enough leeway to get an orderly sale. My guess is that company will get an offer sometime this month. What the price will be we can only guess, but given the distressed state that the company is, I think long-term shareholders are going to be disappointed.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims.

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

Will their banker be gracious and continue to extend financing at the current extremely generous terms (2% interest), or will they impose heavier penalties, or even force a sale of the company at a fire sale price to secure their interests?

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor.

After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Why bother doing the wind down work for faceless public shareholders, when you can do it out of the public spotlight, in private and aimed at solely feeding your own face. 3. The Chairman, CEO and other board members have proven themselves to be incompetent and wholly untrustworthy. They simply do not care a jot about anything other than their own pockets.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Why bother doing the wind down work for faceless public shareholders, when you can do it out of the public spotlight, in private and aimed at solely feeding your own face. 3. The Chairman, CEO and other board members have proven themselves to be incompetent and wholly untrustworthy. They simply do not care a jot about anything other than their own pockets. We\u2019d have been better off keeping Nick Rowles Davies, the former alleged expenses thief who was previously on the board. At least he had the decency to get caught stealing! I say \u201cwe\u201d.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

My rule was that if debt covenants did not get swiftly extended by mid Jan following the GRX update, or there was no communication on the strategic review then I had to get out. The poor return on GRX was the nail in the coffin for me and even future returns for next year or 2 may be hampered by the same performance clause and limit LCM's ability to get out of this situation. It's now the last trading day in Jan, covenants expire tomorrow, and LCM haven't assured the market, or provided an update on strategy. I think things are clearly very much on a tight rope here and one more bit of bad news is probably the end.",

My rule was that if debt covenants did not get swiftly extended by mid Jan following the GRX update, or there was no communication on the strategic review then I had to get out. The poor return on GRX was the nail in the coffin for me and even future returns for next year or 2 may be hampered by the same performance clause and limit LCM's ability to get out of this situation. It's now the last trading day in Jan, covenants expire tomorrow, and LCM haven't assured the market, or provided an update on strategy. I think things are clearly very much on a tight rope here and one more bit of bad news is probably the end.",

Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

If the management and the lenders are aware and cool-headed enough to know this, they will keep their cool and continue with the business as usual. The stock price, however, will yo-yo wildly, as the stockmarket is famously short-sighted. Yes, having a ton of liquidity and/or very understanding lenders/funders is a must for a business like LIT. And very strong stomach for wild stock price fluctuations. The litigation industry is forecast to grow, the management and the company have a very strong track record, if the lenders don't panic, LIT will recover, and then some.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

Why bother doing the wind down work for faceless public shareholders, when you can do it out of the public spotlight, in private and aimed at solely feeding your own face. 3. The Chairman, CEO and other board members have proven themselves to be incompetent and wholly untrustworthy. They simply do not care a jot about anything other than their own pockets.

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

The company is already undergoing a strategic review, and a one month extension to the loan suggests to me that an offer is in an advanced state and that the lender is willing to grant just enough leeway to get an orderly sale. My guess is that company will get an offer sometime this month. What the price will be we can only guess, but given the distressed state that the company is, I think long-term shareholders are going to be disappointed.",

I think much attention will be spent on asserting the quality of the existing case portfolio, if it is up to the usual high standard, all there is to do is wait. Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims.

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

          "content": "Litigation Capital Management Limited (\"LCM\"), an alternative asset manager specialising in dispute financing solutions internationally, announces a positive development in the international arbitration claim against the Republic of Poland (Poland) that it funded. As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",

Growth, however, is tricky, and there is a risk that the management have lowered the standards in order to grow, allowing a flood of poorer quality work to be signed on. Also, the experienced management attention and involvement in selecting cases could have been diluted, or completely diverted away for the new case selection, in that case LIT is doomed. However, the current losses come from cases that are many years old, and are no indication of the quality slippage. There is a lot of money at stake, and quality assurance is mentioned as their prime focus in every release. I have faith that LIT will pull through.",

They are a passive financier of other people\u2019s claims. It is unlawful to sell litigation claims. The single exception to this in Common Law is legal claims within an insolvent estate. Only under the Insolvency Act 1986 is there a specific override to enable liquidators and. administrators to sell legal claims. There is one listed company that does Insolvency claims only and that is MANO. BUR and LIT do a few claims in the specialist insolvency sector but I believe they predominantly fund those as well. So the only option for LCM would be to sell itself. Not its underlying funded claims. Maybe get could put the fund business into a separate entity but I think that would be pointless hairsplitting at this stage because the Fund track is obviously broken beyond repair now.",

Now this is delayed and the negative reaction was rather minor. Sure they needed to post an update before the AGM as they pushed the AGM and made clear that there will probably some result of the review already at the new AGM time but it seems they need more time for possible due diligence or other stuff. After analyzing back and forth with AI I\u2019m slightly more bullish on this update. The language around \u201ccredible counterparties,\u201d \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d and the lender providing covenant relief suggests the process is genuinely active and not just a formality. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a deal, but it signals that real options are on the table and that the lender sees a path forward. Still cautious overall, but the tone leans more positive than negative.",

The review continues to progress well, with constructive engagement underway with a number of credible counterparties. The Company is continuing to evaluate a range of potential strategic options, each considered against the status quo of a transition to a run-off model. Based on the progress made to date, the Board notes that the strategic review has the potential to deliver a transaction that could represent a viable alternative for the Company and its shareholders relative to the status quo. The Company is in regular contact with its secured lender regarding the strategic review, and the secured lender has provided support to date for the progress of the strategic review in the form of covenant relief. However, shareholders are advised that there is no certainty that any transaction will materialise. The Board will only recommend a transaction if it considers it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company will provide a further update in due course and as appropriate, in accordance with its disclosure obligations. \"",

The GRX news was initially a company saver in that it gave them a way to pay off all their debt, and it was just a waiting game for payment which will come. A major re-rate was potentially on the cards. However, with news yesterday that due to appalling recent performance shareholders are only in line to receive a relatively small portion of the overall award, then it is not the good news I understood it to be. It will go some way to paying down debt, but by the time they have received it (could be another 2 years maybe? and even then it could receive a haircut), it won't really touch the sides and debt will be piling up further in the meantime. There are no other major cases coming up which could materially help the balance sheet, so I have decided to reluctantly call it a day. I suspect creditors will extend debt covenants again, but I think the business will go into run-off now, and shareholders only get the crumbs - if any - at the end. Alternatively they will sell some cases but again I don not se material upside from here in the near term if this is the approach. I hope I am wrong for any long term holders choosing to hold on.",

As previously announced on 8 October 2024, the funded party achieved a successful outcome, securing two separate awards - one under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) of \u00a3252 million plus interest; and one under the Australia-Poland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of \u00a3183 million plus interest. There is no double compensation meaning that total damages cannot exceed \u00a3252 million plus interest. Poland commenced set-aside proceedings in Singapore (ECT) and London (BIT) to attempt to annul the original awards. The Singapore proceedings recently concluded and the Singapore court rejected in its entirety Poland's application to set-aside the ECT award. Poland has a right to an appeal and such an appeal must be filed by 6 February 2026. We anticipate an appeal will be filed and expect the Singapore court to resolve such an appeal in the second half of 2026. LCM has invested into this case alongside Fund I investors with the total investment being US$11.3m with US$2.8 million coming from LCM's own balance sheet and US$8.5 million from Fund I. LCM's returns are calculated as a rising multiple of invested capital over time plus interest. LCM's contractual entitlement on this case currently stands at approximately US$71.9 million with US$18.0 million of that flowing to LCM shareholders and US$53.9 million flowing to Fund I investors. LCM does not anticipate earning a performance fee from Fund I investors on this case as a result of previously announced adverse case results impacting Fund I.",
