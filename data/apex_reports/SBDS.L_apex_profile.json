From video to display, mobile, and connected TV, it enables advertisers to manage and optimise digital campaigns across a variety of formats and devices and has been a significant driver in the shift towards programmatic advertising, where ads are bought and sold in real time using automated processes rather than through traditional manual negotiations.\nGlobal programmatic advertising market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8% from 2024 to 2030*\n,\nwith the contextual advertising market expected to reach $468.17 billion by 2030*, and this integration feeds into that marketplace addressing the escalating demand for privacy-first, AI-driven solutions in an era where cookies and third-party data signals are diminishing.\n4D AI data will be made available within the partner DSP as simple to use unique contextual segments (clusters of similar consumers) to allow programmatic buyers to tap into its proprietary AI computer-vision based video classification and advanced AI semantic display classification to accurately deliver advertisements in the most relevant context across premium Connected TV (CTV), Online Video (OLV) and Display inventory. 4D AI will receive a percentage of revenue in respect of every advertiser dollar spent using its unique segments. Additionally, these pre-bid targeting segments are seamlessly integrated with the\n4D\nAI Insights Platform\n,\nproviding advertisers with actionable insights, optimisations and measurement to enhance campaign performance during and post the advertising campaign.\nThis milestone underscores 4D AI's commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions that help advertisers achieve greater precision, efficiency, and success in their digital campaigns.\nThe partnership demonstrates strong demand for 4D AI's data and will ensure seamless integration for customers. This development marks a major step toward positioning 4D AI as a more relevant player and an established part of the advertising ecosystem.\nIan James, Silver Bullet Data Services Group Chief Executive, commented\n:\n\"Integrating our 4D AI Advanced Contextual pre-bid targeting into a leading global demand-side\nplatform is the culmination of three years hard work, marking a significant milestone for our business and underscoring the strength of our product offerings. This collaboration enables advertisers to leverage our proprietary AI-driven solutions, enhancing precision in ad placements across premium channels like Connected TV, Online Video and Display inventory. By simplifying the buying process, we will further empower our clients to navigate the evolving digital landscape effectively, unlocking substantial opportunities in a future dominated by AI driven privacy-first solutions.\"\n*\nGrand View Research\nFor further information please contact:\nSilverbullet\nvia IFC\nIan James (CEO) / Chris Ellis (CFO)\nStrand Hanson Limited - Financial and Nominated Adviser\n0207 409 3494\nJames Spinney / James Bellman / Robert Collins\nZeus Capital Limited - Joint Broker\n0203 829 5000\nSimon Johnson / Jake Walker\nCMC Markets - Joint Broker\n0203 003 8632\nDouglas Crippen\nIFC Advisory\n020 3934 6630\nGraham Herring / Tim Metcalfe / Florence Chandler\n07793 839 024\nAbout Silverbullet\nSilverbullet's proprietary 4D AI advertising solution is designed to help advertisers target consumers in a \"privacy-first world\".\nHeadquartered in London,\u00a0the Group employs 85+ data specialists across five regions across the globe, including, the UK, Italy, Australia, USA and Latin America.
