Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nPress Release\n30 September 2024\nAshington Innovation plc\n(\"Ashington\" or \"the Company\")\nInterim results\nAshington Innovation plc (LSE: ASHI; FSE: 6FW), a special purpose acquisition company (\"SPAC\"), announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2024.\nInterim Management Report:\nDuring the period, the Board of Directors continued to assess potential acquisition targets across the financial technology (\"fintech\") and deep technology sectors, with the purpose of creating a combined business which will generate increased value for the Company's shareholders.\nThe sector opportunity for a value-generating acquisition remains strong. The global market for fintech is expected to reach $645 billion by 2029\n(source: Market Data Forecast, 2024),\nand more than $7.2 billion has been invested into deep tech in 2024 alone\n(source: Sifted, 2024).\nIn January 2024, the Company terminated discussions with Cell Therapy Ltd. (\"Cell Therapy\") and Calon Cardio-Technology Ltd. (\"Calon\"). The Company had been in discussions to acquire 100% of the total issued equity of Cell Therapy and Calon in an all-share transaction (the \"Transaction\"). Due to prevailing market conditions, Ashington's Directors decided that the Transaction was no longer in the best interests of shareholders.\nThe Company is in early stage discussions with a number of potential targets and will provide an update to the market if and when negotiations become suitably advanced.\nIn the post-period, Ashington raised \u00a3200,000 by way of a share subscription of 10 million new ordinary shares at a price per share of \u00a30.02, which was at a 150% premium to the Company's share price of \u00a30.008. The significant premium is a validation of the Board's existing strategy to facilitate a value-creating acquisition.\nNo revenue was generated during the period and the Company incurred a loss before tax of \u00a3202,036, reflecting the increased ongoing operating costs of being a listed company. However,\nbased on the Directors' assessment of the Company's cash needs and the availability of financing, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources or access to further capital to continue to operate for the foreseeable future and as such have maintained the Company's going concern basis.\nThe interim financial report is available for download from the Company's website (\nwww.ashingtoninnovation.com\n).\nFor further information please contact:\nAshington Innovation plc\nJason Smart\nNon-Executive Director\nvia Tancredi +44 207 887 7633\nTancredi Intelligent Communication\nMedia Relations\nHelen Humphrey\nCharlie Hobbs\nNeha Dhakal\nashington@tancredigroup.com\n+\n44 7449 226 720\n+44 7897 557 112\n+44 7915 035 294\nAbout\nAshington Innovation plc\nAshington Innovation plc is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), formed with the intention of acquiring businesses operating in the technology sector, in particular the financial services technology and deep technology sectors.\nThe Company believes that in the increasingly fast-changing global environment there will be an abundance of opportunities to acquire existing businesses in the technology sector, and in particular businesses that possess and utilise proprietary technologies and own applicable intellectual property.\nThe Company is not limited to any specific geographic region in identifying its target companies.\nwww.ashingtoninnovation.com\n.\nForward-looking statements:\nThis announcement may contain \"forward-looking\" statements and information relating to the Company.

The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial information in this interim report are consistent with those adopted in the annual statutory financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2023.\nIn preparing the interim financial report, management made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Company accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
