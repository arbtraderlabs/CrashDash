    "hidden_patterns": [
      "The simultaneous presence of massive retail interest and zero volatility suggests a potential manipulation window or an impending regulatory suspension.",

The mismatch between hype and lack of trading activity points to potential manipulation or regulatory suspension, making the investment highly risky. Nonetheless, if the company resolves its issues or is re\u2011listed, the existing retail FOMO could drive a sharp rebound, offering a contrarian upside for those willing to accept extreme risk."
