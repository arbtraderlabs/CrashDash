    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "The simultaneous presence of a deep crash bottom and a retail\u2011fomo peak is rare; it implies a potential \u2018price\u2011fixing\u2019 event where institutional players may be buying at the bottom before a rebound.",
      "The absence of any RNS or catalyst, combined with zero volatility metrics, hints at a possible data feed outage or a pending regulatory filing that has not yet been reflected in the market."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [

      "0.00p entry price likely represents a data error or a share price that has collapsed to zero, indicating potential bankruptcy or delisting.",
      "Zero volatility figures (ATR & StdDev) mean the price history is incomplete; relying on technical analysis is risky.",

    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If the company files a positive RNS (e.g., new funding round, asset sale) the stock could rebound sharply from a near\u2011zero base.",

Traders should monitor for a sudden RNS that could unlock a steep upside, but must be prepared for a zero\u2011price collapse or delisting."
