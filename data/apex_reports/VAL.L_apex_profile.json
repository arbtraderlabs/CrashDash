This stark contradiction indicates the company is likely suspended or delisted, yet hype is building for a possible relisting or price reset.",
      "A deep crash bottom (87.1% drawdown) coupled with a base score of 12/21 signals extreme downside risk, but the absence of any RNS or catalysts means no fundamental driver exists to justify the crash. The lack of social posts and sentiment data further confirms the stock\u2019s \u201cdead\u2011market\u201d status.",
      "The entry price of 0.00p is a red flag for potential fraud, liquidation, or a reverse\u2011split event. In AIM markets, a 0.00p price often precedes a relisting where shares are re\u2011priced at a nominal value (e.g., 1p) to re\u2011activate trading."

    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Zero price + zero volatility + no social chatter + high Google Trends = a classic \u2018paper\u2011stock\u2019 scenario where speculation outpaces any real trading activity.",

      "Fraud / manipulation risk: zero price and no corporate updates raise the possibility of a pump\u2011and\u2011dump scheme or a fraudulent listing.",
