    "hidden_patterns": [
      "The temporal mismatch \u2013 a sharp surge in search interest coinciding with a complete absence of trading activity \u2013 points to a possible coordinated marketing push or a data error.",
      "The combination of a deep crash bottom, zero price, and zero volatility is a rare pattern that often precedes a corporate restructuring or a re\u2011listing attempt, but it can also be a red flag for a \u201cdead\u2011stock\u201d scenario."
