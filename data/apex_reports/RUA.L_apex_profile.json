The longer reporting period results from the Company's decision to change its year-end from March to September, providing additional time to integrate the Abiss acquisition and to align our reporting cycle with that of a major customer to support improved planning. The financial results for the period to 30 September 2025 are presented below together with the strategic and organisational progress achieved by the Company. Throughout the Report and Accounts, reported revenues and expense items relate to an 18-month period, whilst prior period comparatives are for the 12 months to 31 March 2024.\nBackground\nI concluded my statement last year by observing that RUA had recently switched from a business with funding required to finance the needs of R&D projects to a financially strong business focussed on growth, cash generation and profitability. It is against this background that we set out this report.\nTrading for Year\nThe headline trading results demonstrate that RUA has made exceptional progress towards its objectives of growth and profitability. Revenue grew over threefold from \u00a32.19 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a36.69 million in the 18 month period to September 2025. Losses before tax reduced from \u00a32.02 million to \u00a30.24 million a reduction of 86%.\nThe Abiss acquisition added customers, capability and momentum and, on completion, generated a non-recurring bargain-purchase gain of \u00a30.9m. While that item lifts the reported result, the direction of travel is clear, a larger, better-balanced business moving toward sustainable profitability.\nAs set out in the Strategic Report below, the improved trading is a result of growth in Contract Manufacture and the acquisition of Abiss together with tight cost control and the elimination of certain roles within the Group.\nNet cash outflow excluding proceeds from share issues was much reduced from the \u00a31.49 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a30.66 million for the 18-month period to September 2025. It is pleasing that in the final six months of the period, there was a net cash inflow from operating activities meeting the objective of reaching a position of cash generation from trading.\nCash balances at 30 September 2025 remained strong at \u00a33.25 million after having repaid a mortgage of \u00a30.11 million on the Drummond Crescent factory unit.\nIndustry Drivers\nIn the last interim report, I discussed the long-term nature of the medical device industry. The industry in many areas is dominated by large corporations which tend to be risk averse and often leave true innovation to smaller, entrepreneurial organisations but later acquire that innovation once proven.\nThe regulatory environment is also highly structured, both for demonstrating the necessary safety and efficacy to obtain an initial marketing authority, and also for the additional submissions required if there is a change to a device. Against this background, progress in the industry is typically slow; however, when it does occur, it can generate high value, attractive margins and strong barriers to entry, reflecting the substantial investment required to bring a product to market and sustain it.\nAchieving growth as a contract manufacturer of devices or licensor of technology is long-term in nature, as it follows the market penetration of the device.\nThe focus on commerciality over the past two years has not only positioned RUA well to grow alongside its partners but has brought a number of early-stage contract development opportunities that engage the R&D team and have set the foundations for future manufacturing revenues.\nFuture Drivers\nAs the business has come through the transition from being R&D to commercially focussed, revenue growth will be driven by an integrated contract development and manufacturing business working closely with partners at all stages of their product lifecycles. In addition, the business owns a substantial IP portfolio in polymers, composite materials and manufacturing processes that will drive licensing and component supply opportunities.\nConclusion\nThe two year objectives set at the time of the 2023 Strategy Review, of doubling revenues, reducing cash burn and focussing on profitability have been achieved ahead of time through strong trading and the purchase of the Abiss subsidiary in France. We look forward to building upon this success through broadening both services for current customers and expanding the customer base further.\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nG\nroup Performance\nThe Group entered the financial period with an emphasis towards growth, profitability and cash generation. This short term commercial focus represented a significant change from previous, longer term ambitions of growing infrastructure to support R&D activities to having a short term commercial focus. At the point of this transition, a number of senior roles were eliminated from the business with total annualised payroll savings of over \u00a30.6 million. The executive leadership team was restructured and empowered to deliver on the Group objectives. Reflecting upon the objectives set for the business, they were ambitious and stretching and the progress made over the past 18 months is a significant achievement by the team.\nThe financial performance over the period of this report has seen a substantial improvement in the position of the Group, driven by growth in customer engagement, cost control and strategic acquisitions.\nAs the shape and focus of the business has changed it is an opportune time to summarise what the key activities of the Group are:\n\u00b7\nWe develop components and finished devices under contract for customers.\n\u00b7\nWe manufacture devices and components for customers under long term contracts.\n\u00b7\nWe manufacture, market and distribute our own medical devices through Abiss.\n\u00b7\nWe develop medical device and component IP in house using our talented and experienced team of engineers.\n\u00b7\nWe license our IP to industry partners to enable their devices.\nAs mentioned in the Chairman's Statement, product development in the medical device industry can be slow but there are a number of attractions in becoming established and embedded in these development projects:\n\u00b7\nHigh barriers to entry, both technical and regulatory.\n\u00b7\nHigh margin potential from both device and component supply.\n\u00b7\nLong product lifecycles: 10-20 years providing long term revenue visibility.\nRUA operates in a long term industry with high value outcomes on success. Developing a new medical device or implant is a structured, multi-year process. Each phase of development is designed to ensure product safety, reliability and regulatory compliance and can typically take from five to eight years for a device to be approved. The key stages and activities in this process are:\n\u00b7\nPhase 1 - Research and Feasibility\nEarly scientific research is undertaken and prototypes are developed. This can involve up to 2 years work.\n\u00b7\nPhase 2 - Design and Development\nEngineering work is undertaken to turn prototypes into finished devices and testing of those devices is performed. Again this is typically a 2 year period.\n\u00b7\nPhase 3 - Clinical studies\nStudies to ensure device safety and performance with timescales determined by the study design but typically over a one to two year period.\n\u00b7\nPhase 4 - Regulatory dossier submission\nReview and clearance activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals.\nOnce approved, the device will be launched onto the market and volume manufacture is required. A succesful device can have a lifespan of 10-20 years. Any change to the device or manufacturing process can require parts of these steps to be undertaken again.\nRUA is a Contract Developer and Manufacturer of medical devices and components and we need to be engaged with customers at the appropiate stage of their device lifecycle. Our marketing approach has been to partner with customers at the Design and Development stage of their projects, becoming a key part of their R&D process (and budget) and partnering to become the manufacturer of either components or finished devices once Regulatory Approval has been achieved. Additionally, we recognised that during the product marketing phase, supply chain risks appear and customers may be let down by other external suppliers. RUA is becoming recognised as a problem solver, working succesfuly with customers to avoid product shortages.\nThe spectacular growth we have enjoyed in our contracting business, termed Medical Devices and Components, over the past 18 months has been a result of our reputation for quality, innovation and agility, drawing customers to RUA when they have a problem that needs to be solved. The new material project announced in July 2024 and the acquisition of Abiss in September 2024 were examples of our ability to support these needs..\nImportantly, RUA is now contracted on several earlier stage projects at or beyond the Design and Development stage of device lifecycles. This will ensure additional revenue from engineering services and future device or component supply.\nIP Exploitation\nRUA has developed a substantial IP portfolio in house with potential and opportunities to further exploit.\nThe areas of IP are:\n\u00b7\nThe world leading, long term implantable polyurethane - Elast-EonTM.\n\u00b7\nPolymer processing technology to convert textile into an Elast-Eon composite - AurTexTM.\n\u00b7\nMechanical testing data suite on AurTex with indications for use in multiple areas.\n\u00b7\nPolymer heart valve technology and data including AurTex and Elast-Eon as leaflet material.\n\u00b7\nA fully designed and developed polymer coated vascular graft together with agreed FDA protocol for clinical studies.\n\u00b7\nA technical file ready for approval on a next generation single incision mini-sling for treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI).\n\u00b7\nRegulatory approved mesh devices for pelvic floor disorders.\n\u00b7\nNext generation material as alternative to mesh/tape in SUI.\nElast-Eon\nThe reporting period has seen a growth in our IP related revenue from \u00a30.49 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a30.91 million in the current 18 month period. On a like for like basis this is a 24% increase year on year. This is all related to Biomaterials and the licensing of Elast-Eon. There are growth indicators within this area with good performance from established devices in the market together with customer products currently at Design/Development/Regulatory stages that can lead to growth in licence and royalty fees.\nStructural Heart\nOver the past 18 months, we have continued selective investment in our AurTex material and its application for heart valve leaflets. This work has been in support of a serious interest in AurTex for a specific heart valve need. The development work is showing promise, and we hope to make further progress during the current period. The Board's objective is to move future activities in this area off book whilst being able to recognise value created to date.\nVascular\nNo further investment is being made in this area. Some of the technology developed has enabled early stage revenues for our Contract Design and Development business with contracts for supply of crimping services and coated grafts supplied as components for further processing. It has been a disapointment that we have to date not succeeded in finding a partner to take on the regulatory burden of bringing the graft range to market.\nAbiss\nThis business was purchased to ensure that the supply of a range of products to a major customer remained secure. Future product strategy is being discussed with the customer, and the results of those discussions will drive how certain IP within Abiss will be exploited in the future. We have been encouraged by the depth of product IP within Abiss and are seeking to build upon it for the benefit of both the Abiss business and the wider Group.\nWithin the IP of the Group, there are at least four product ranges or even potential businesses that can be developed. Our strategy is to find partners willing to support each project with RUA providing Contract Development and Manufacturing services for a financial return through royalties or otherwise on the provision of the initial IP.\nOutlook\nLast year, we set the expectation of growing Biomaterials licence income as well as engaging with customers to double the scale of our Contract Manufacturing business. We were succesful in meeting those expectations and intend to grow each of those areas further during the current year. In addition, a key focus of management will be to exploit further the considerable IP portfolio within the business.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe focus of the period has been to grow the established businesses of Biomaterials and Contract Manufacture, which enjoy strong contractual revenue streams and generate attractive net margins. Ambitious targets were set for the Group at the start of the period, and it is positive that we have been able to perform in line with these expectations. The period under review is an extended 18 months to 30 September 2025 as a result of the change in year-end. The corresponding results for last year represent the 12 months to 31 March 2024 and, as such, are not directly comparable.\nRevenue\nGroup revenue for the 18-month period ended 30 September 2025 was \u00a36.7 million compared to the 12 months to 31 March 2024 of \u00a32.2 million. The period benefited from strong organic growth together with the first-time contribution from the acquisition of Abiss..\nRevenue by segment\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and ComponentsUK Operations: \u00a33.6 million (53% of Group revenue). On a like for like basis this represents 41 % growth from higher volumes and demand together with new business from new and existing customers.\nEU Operations: (Abiss Group): \u00a32.2 million (33% of Group revenue). New contribution in the period, broadening the Group's revenue base and adding complementary manufacturing income.\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials: \u00a30.9 million (14% of Group revenue). This area grew from the \u00a30.5 million reported last year representing annualised growth of 20%.Performance remained resilient, despite the stronger Sterling versus US Dollar exchange rate during parts of the period.\nOverall, the revenue profile is now more diversified, with\nMedical Devices and Components (UK and Abiss combined) representing c.86% of Group revenue and Biomaterials c.14%, positioning the Group for more balanced growth going into the next period.\nAcquisition of Abiss\nOn 6th September 2024, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Abiss France SAS, a France-based medical device group, for cash consideration of \u00a368k.\nThe acquisition provides the Group with an established manufacturing and development platform in continental Europe, broadens its medical device product offering and customer base, and is expected to generate operational and commercial synergies across the Group.\nA fair value adjustment to align the identified assets and liabilities of Abiss to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, including adjustments to inventory, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and provisions has resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of \u00a30.9 million being recognised.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nFor the 18 months to 30 September 2025, general and administrative (G&A) expenses were \u00a36.5 million (12 months to 31 March 2024: \u00a33.8 million, not directly comparable due to the extended reporting period and business mix). The 2025 figure includes 13 months of the Abiss Group.\nDepreciation & amortisation: \u00a30.7 million (c.10.2% of G&A) vs \u00a30.4 million in 2024 (c.9.6%).\nCost control remains a management focus. Throughout 2025, we tightened budgeting and approval processes, enhanced spend visibility, and strengthened financial controls across the Group (including Abiss). These actions improved oversight of operating costs and are intended to support a more efficient run-rate going forward.\nResearch and development costs\nAs first outlined in November 2023, the Group continued to re-prioritise resources away from pre-commercial R&D toward near-term profitability and customer delivery.For the 18 months to 30 September 2025, the Group expensed \u00a30.4 million of Research & Development costs (12 months to 31 March 2024: \u00a30.9 million). The lower spend is a consequence of our strategy to redeploy expenditure away from long term development projects.\nNo development costs were capitalised in the period; all amounts were expensed to the income statement as they relate primarily to early-stage development activities, where the technical feasibility, commercial viability and timing of future revenues are not yet sufficiently certain to meet the criteria for capitalisation.\nConsistent with commitments made at the 2023 fundraise, we intend to reduce R&D expenditure further over the next 12 months, concentrating only on projects that demonstrably support profitable growth or are directly funded by third parties.\nShare-based payment charges\nThe business operates share option plans for key personnel, which incurred a charge for share-based payment expenses of \u00a3171,000 for the period compared to a credit of \u00a335,000 in 2024. The non-cash credit in 2024 is attributed to a writeback related to the cancellation of share option awarded to two executives who left the Group during the year to 31 March 2024.\nNet finance costs\nFor the 18 months to 30 September 2025, the Group recorded net finance income of \u00a321,000 (12 months to 31 March 2024: net finance costs \u00a383,000)\nThe improvement reflects interest earned on surplus cash held in a low-risk liquidity fund during the period and the repayment of borrowings.\nThis figure is net of unrealised foreign exchange losses of \u00a331,000 (2024: \u00a328,000).\nLosses before taxation\nIn the year to 31 March 2024, the Group incurred a pre tax loss of \u00a32.0m, The trading improvements and Abiss acquisition referred to above contributed to a much reduced loss of \u00a30.2m in the 18 month period to 30 September 2025. This loss includes the effect of a \u00a30.9 million non-cash gain on bargain purchase from the Abiss acquisition. Excluding this item, the underlying loss before tax was \u00a31.1 million. The periods are not directly comparable due to the move from a 12-month to an 18-month reporting period and the acquisition of Abiss during the period.\nLoss per share\nBasic and diluted loss per share for the period was 0.35 pence (2024: 4.29 pence).\nTaxation\nThe Group claims research and development tax credits each year and, since it is currently loss making, elects to surrender these tax credits for a cash rebate. The amount is included within the taxation line of the consolidated income statement in respect of amounts receivable for the surrender of research and development expenditure amounting to \u00a30.4m (2024: \u00a30.9m). The Group has not recognised any tax assets in respect of trading losses arising in the current financial year or accumulated losses in previous financial years.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA, which includes non-cash share-based payment expenses, improved \u00a32.0million to a positive \u00a30.4 million in the period (FY24: loss \u00a31.6 million) as a result of the improvement in revenue volumes and gross margin and gain on bargain purchase from the acquisition of the Abiss Group.\nCashflow\nClosing cash at 30 September was \u00a33.2 million (2024: \u00a33.9 million)\nCash preservation remains a strategic objective. Throughout the year, operating cash outflows from operations amounted to \u00a30.2 million (2024: \u00a31.3 million), reflecting the financial activities and commitments required to sustain business operations and growth initiatives.\nThe business invested \u00a3161,000 in capital expenditure during the year (2024: \u00a355,000), Spend remained tightly controlled and focused on essential replacement and maintenance, with no significant new capital projects undertaken, reflecting our ongoing cash preservation and cost discipline strategy.\nFinancial position\nDuring the year, the Group completed the acquisition of Abiss, a French medical device business, marking a significant strategic step in expanding our capabilities and market reach. Our financial position remains robust, with net assets at 30 September 2025 of \u00a37.1 million (2024: \u00a37.2 million).\nIntangible assets (not including Goodwill) reduced to \u00a30.3 million (2024: \u00a30.4 million), reflecting an amortisation charge of \u00a382,000, partially offset by \u00a311,000 of intangibles acquired with the Abiss Group.\nDividends\nNo dividends have been proposed for the period ended 30 September 2025 (2024: \u00a3nil).\nSTRATEGY\nThe mission of the Group is to be a long-term trusted partner to the medical device industry through specialisation in implantable textiles and biostable polymers and related technology. This is being undertaken through:\n\u00b7\nInternational growth via licensing Elast-Eon to third parties through RUA Biomaterials;\n\u00b7\nInternational growth through Medical Devices and Components businesses exploiting implantable textiles expertise;\n\u00b7\nPartnering with other parties to exploit and monetise the substantial Intellectual Property developed within the Group.\nRUA Life Sciences will seek to maximise shareholder value by growing each business to achieve attractive levels of profitability or disposing of business areas if the valuations are attractive.\nSummarised

incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The registered head office is 2 Drummond Crescent, Riverside Business Park, Irvine, Ayrshire, KA11 5AN.\nThe Company (together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\") was under the control of the directors throughout the period covered in the financial statements. The list of the subsidiaries consolidated in the financial statements is shown in Note xx.\nThe principal activity of the Group is exploiting the value of its IP & know-how, medical device contract manufacturing and development of cardiovascular devices.\n1.\nBasis of preparation and status of financial information\nThe financial information set out in this preliminary announcement does not constitute statutory accounts as defined by section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information for the period ended 30 September 2025 and the year ended 31 March 2024 does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for those years. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The statutory accounts for the period ended 30 September 2025 were approved by the Board on 10 November 2025 and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course. The statutory accounts for the period ended 30 September 2025 will be posted to shareholders at least 21 days before the Annual General Meeting and made available on the Group's website.\nThe Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2025, from which the financial information presented in this announcement has been extracted, were prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards (\"IFRS\"). The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of certain items, which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the principal accounting policies set out in the Group's Annual Report. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event, or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nThe auditor's reports on the accounts for 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2024 were unqualified and did not contain a statement under 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\n2.\nSignificant accounting policies - Going concern\nAt 30 September 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a33.25 million. As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the Group's cash and cash equivalents were approximately \u00a32.8 million\nThe Directors have prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows looking beyond 12 months from the date of the approval of these financial statements. In developing these forecasts, the Directors have made assumptions based upon their view of the current and future economic conditions that will prevail over the forecast period.\nThe cash flow predictions are based on a period of closely controlled cash flows to maintain ongoing development at a level commensurate with our means. Third party sources of funding are being explored to accelerate the development of our vascular graft portfolio and structural heart technology, in line with our corporate objectives.\nThe Directors estimate that the cash held by the Group together with known receivables will be sufficient to support the planned level of activities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (being a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report), and for this reason, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n3. Revenue\nGroup revenue for the period was \u00a36.7 million (2024: \u00a32.2 million). The current period covers an 18-month reporting period, compared with a 12-month comparative period, and therefore, the results are not directly comparable. In addition, the increase in revenue reflects the inclusion of revenue from businesses acquired during the period. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the extended reporting period and acquisitions, underlying revenue performance was broadly in line with management expectations.\nRevenue analysed by class of business\nPeriod ended\nYear ended\n30 September 2025\n31 March 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContract Design & Manufacture of Medical Devices\n5,775\n1,695\nRoyalty revenue\n914\n496\nTotal\n6,689\n2,191\nRevenue analysed by geographical market\nPeriod ended\nYear ended\n30 September 2025\n31 March 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nEurope\n1,173\n196\nNorth America\n5,396\n1,945\nMiddle East\n81\n50\nAsia Pacific\n37\n-\nAfrica\n2\n-\nTotal\n6,689\n2,191\n4. Other income\nOther income for the period includes a gain on bargain purchase arising on the acquisition of Abiss France SAS, reflecting the excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired over the consideration transferred. The gain arose due to the distressed circumstances of the vendor following the insolvency of its ultimate parent company.\nPeriod ended\nYear ended\n30 September 2025\n31 March 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nGovernment Grants\n44\n63\nRental Income\n28\n13\nGain On Bargain Purchase\n895\n-\nMiscellaneous Income\n47\n3\nTotal\n1,014\n79\n5. Acquisitions\nOn 6 September 2024, the Group acquired 100% of Abiss France SAS for cash consideration of \u00a368k and, through this acquisition, obtained indirect control of Abiss Poland sp. z o.o., in which Abiss France holds a 60% interest. A non-controlling interest was recognised in respect of the remaining 40% held by minority shareholders.\nThe acquisition resulted in a gain on bargain purchase, reflecting the distressed circumstances of the vendor following the insolvency of Abiss France's ultimate parent company. The transaction price was further influenced by the business's reliance on a single major customer and the limited pool of potential acquirers. The Group's existing technical capability, regulatory expertise and established customer relationship enabled it to complete the acquisition at a price below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nFrom the acquisition date to 30 September 2025, Abiss contributed revenue of \u00a32.2m and a loss before tax of \u00a30.2m to the Group. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2024, Group revenue for the 18-month period would have been \u00a37.6m with a loss before tax of \u00a30.6m. Fair value adjustments reflect the alignment of acquired assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.\n6.\nPreliminary announcement\nThe summary accounts set out above do not constitute statutory accounts as defined by section 434 of the UK Companies Act 2006. The summarised consolidated statement of financial position at\u00a030 September 2025, the summarised consolidated income statement, the summarised consolidated cash flow statement and the summarised consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended have been extracted from the Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended\u00a030 September 2025\u00a0upon which the auditor's opinion is unqualified and did not contain a statement under either sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. The audit report for the year ended\u00a030 September 2025\u00a0did not contain statements under sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory financial statements for the year ended\u00a031 March 2024\u00a0have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The\u00a030 September 2025 accounts were approved by the Directors on\n29 January 2026, but have not yet been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\n7.\nEarnings per share\nThe basic and diluted loss per ordinary share of\u00a00.35 pence\u00a0(2024: loss of\u00a04.29 pence) is calculated on the loss of the Group of\u00a0\u00a3218,000\u00a0(2024: loss of\u00a0\u00a31,440,000\u00a0) and on\n62,060,272\n(2024:\n33,546,577\n)\u00a0ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.\n8.

This extended reporting period is a result of the previously reported decision to extend the Company's financial year end from 31 March to 30 September.\nTrading update\nOver the period, the Group has made substantial progress in growing from a Research and Development-focused business to a mature revenue-generating business, as demonstrated by the very encouraging results below.\nRevenue\nThe Group expects to report revenues for the 18-month period of \u00a36.6 million compared to the \u00a32.2 million reported for 12 months to March 2024. Adjusting for the extended reporting period, revenues were \u00a34.4 million on a pro-rata basis and \u00a35.1 million for the final 12 months of the period.\nThis strong increase in revenue has been driven by a switch in focus from R&D activities to commercial activity. The key contributors were:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties - increased from \u00a30.5 million for the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a30.9 million for the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 80%.\n\u00b7\nUK-based Contract Manufacturing business grew revenues from \u00a31.7 million in the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a33.5 million in the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 105%.\n\u00b7\nAbiss group, the French based medical device manufacturer acquired by the Group in September 2024 generated revenues of \u00a32.2 million in the 12 months to September 2025.\nCustomer Concentration\nThe UK based Contract Manufacture business (UKCM) historically generated around 95% of its revenue from one major customer. Substantial efforts have been made to seek to grow and diversify the customer base by numbers and value. In the final six months of the reporting period, customer concentration was reduced with 54% from the largest customer, 33% from the new supply contract announced in January this year and 13% from business development activity that if projects are successful could drive the revenue growth of the future.\nPath to profitability\nIn 12 months to March 2024, the group sustained an operating loss of \u00a31.9 million and EBITDA loss of \u00a31.6m (adjusted for non-cash share based payments). An objective of management at the start of the period was to get the Group to breakeven and through to profitability in as short a period as possible.\nAt the second Interim period for the 12 months to March 2025, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5 million profit was reported after benefiting from the \u00a30.9 million bargain purchase gain on the Abiss acquisition. It is anticipated that when taken for the full 18 month period to September 2025 the Group will continue to be EBITDA positive.\nCash control\nIn the year to March 2024, cash utilisation within the Group amounted to \u00a31.5 million, reflecting the EBITDA loss for that period. As previously reported, cash utilisation for the 12 months to March 2025 was substantially reduced to around \u00a3400k with period end cash balances of \u00a33.5 million. The Group expects to report cash at 30 September 2025 of \u00a33.2 million however the net cash reduction is expected to be represented by increased working capital requirements as a result of the growth in scale of the Group.\nReporting timetable\nFollowing the change of accounting reference date announced on\u00a030 October 2024, publication of full audited accounts for the 18-month period ending\u00a030 September 2025 is expected\u00a0by end of\u00a0January 2026.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated:\n\"The growth achieved by RUA over the past 18 months has been exceptional demonstrated both by the revenues reported and by the ever growing opportunities with existing and new customers. This has been a true team effort and I am very grateful to everyone within the RUA Group for their contribution.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the\u00a0UK\u00a0version of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (2014/596), which is part of\u00a0UK\u00a0law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chief Executive Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nLachlan Smith, Group\u00a0Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nGiles Balleny/Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nHarriet Ward (Broking)\nNigel Birks (Healthcare Specialist Sales)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nAbout RUA Life Sciences\nRUA Life Sciences plc\u00a0is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose principal activities comprise exploiting the value\nof its IP & know-how, medical device contract manufacturing and development of medical devices.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As previously announced to shareholders, the Company extended its reporting period to 30 September 2025, and the full 18 month period report and accounts will be published during January 2026. These interim accounts do, however, cover a year's trading at RUA and, compared to the previous year-end results, demonstrate the substantial progress made during the year.\nThe focus of the business over the past twelve months has been to increase the size and scale of our medical device and component manufacturing business whilst keeping a tight control over costs. Growing a medical device business in the short term is not straightforward as customer decisions and timelines are driven by strict regulatory considerations rather than shorter term financial objectives. Although frustrating compared to other industries, the compensation tends to be the attractive margins achievable and the longer term nature of supply contracts.\nAgainst this general industry background, the results are encouraging.\nRevenue\nIn the year to 31 March 2025, Group revenues grew by 88% from \u00a32,191k to \u00a34,113k, achieving much of our 2-3 year objective to double revenues within the period. All of the revenue-generating business units have contributed to this growth, with Biomaterials growing 18% from \u00a3496k to \u00a3587k, the Medical Device and Components business increasing 110% from \u00a31,679k to \u00a33,526k. Of this growth, \u00a3550k (33%) was contributed by the UK Contract Manufacture business. On 6 September 2024, the Group acquired the business of ABISS France, and in the period from the acquisition to 31 March 2025, contributed further revenue of \u00a31,296k.\nGross Profit\nOver the period, gross profits increased by 79% from \u00a31,776k to \u00a33,172k. The Gross Margin, however, fell from 81% to 77% over the period. This reduction is partly due to the Biomaterials business, on which gross margins remain at over 94%, being diluted by the faster-growing contract manufacturing business. The margins were also depressed by the integration of ABISS Group. The underlying margin in both the Biomaterials and UK Contract manufacture business increased during the period, but the Gross Margin recognised at ABISS during the period was a lower 68% reflecting on consolidation the fair value of work in progress held on the date of acquisition. The normal gross margin at ABISS has historically been around 75% and is expected to return to those levels in the medium term.\nOther Income\nOther income is represented in the main by the bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of ABISS. Having concluded the fair value calculation of the assets and liabilities of ABISS, the gain amounts to \u00a3917k. Of this gain \u00a3322k reflects the recognition of the work in progress, the attributed value of which had the resultant depressing impact on gross margin recognised on consolidation.\nCosts\nA key objective is to control the costs within the business. Over the period, administration costs increased by 10% to \u00a34,161. This increase is represented by the overheads within the acquired ABISS business of \u00a3757k and savings made within the UK business as a result of an organisational restructure enabling higher levels of activity and efficiency.\nBreak-even for the period\nAs a result of tight cost control, growth in revenues and the initial benefits of the ABISS acquisition, a small post-tax profit of \u00a31k was achieved compared to a loss of \u00a31,440k in the comparative 12 month period.\nCash\nOver the 12 months to March, the business saw consolidated cash balances reduce from \u00a33.9m to \u00a33.6m, representing cash consumption of \u00a30.3m. This reduced level of cash burn demonstrates improved cost control, and management is committed to further reducing cash burn over the remaining six months of the financial period to September 2025.\nAcquisition of ABISS\nOn acquisition, RUA paid \u00a368k for the entire issued share capital of ABISS (France), together with a 60% interest in ABISS (Poland), a distributor of ABISS-manufactured medical devices. The (preliminary) fair value of the identified net assets on acquisition has been adjusted to \u00a3985k, resulting in a bargain purchase gain of \u00a3917k.\nABISS is the legal manufacturer of pelvic floor repair devices under CE Mark and a subcontract manufacturer of the same devices for a US manufacturer. ABISS was purchased with a short-term order backlog, which was fulfilled in the period. However overall, inventory levels at ABISS's customer had been increased to levels higher than required due to the supply chain risk as a result of the status of the former parent of ABISS. There will be a period of reduced orders as this excess inventory is worked through the system. However, ABISS is not anticipated to be a drag on the Group during this period.\nThere are\nstructural changes in the competitive landscape\nwithin the\nEuropean pelvic floor device\nmarket, driven by two of the market's major players. One has withdrawn entirely from the European market, while another has transferred its product portfolio to a business with no current European presence. The structural impact is believed to affect around 70% of an estimated market of more than \u20ac25 million. These products will still require to be sourced by hospitals. ABISS 's customers should benefit from this opportunity, but ABISS is also seeking to expand its distribution networks for its own product range. ABISS has manufacturing capacity to supply a significantly larger market share, and as an indication of the operational gearing within the business, it has historically achieved a 30% net margin on revenues of over \u20ac3 million.\nBusiness review\nSince the equity fund raise in December 2023, significant progress has been made by the business in its objectives of growing the contract manufacturing business and controlling costs. The progress and potential have been accelerated through the purchase of ABISS and deepening relationships with major customers allowing a shorter pathway to profitability. Over the same period, little of the progress made by the Company has been reflected in the share price, and indeed it has not progressed from the heavily discounted price of the fund raise.\nThe business had previously been pursuing a strategy of developing its own devices to bring to market, however, the ability to exploit these business areas was prohibited by the quantity of capital and the cost of that capital. The strategy was therefore switched to focus on the biomaterials and contract manufacturing part of the business.\nWe believe that the historical investment in both grafts and heart valve material will result in revenues to the group through a combination of licensing income and device/component manufacturing revenues. It is however counterproductive to have market expectations based on the potential to exploit IP at a time when the Company is marketing and negotiating potential contracts. Rather than provide a commentary of developments, we will focus on reporting the outcomes of deals once completed.\nFocus for growth\nRUA has been profitable on an occasional monthly basis over the period and is much closer to our objectives of being profitable on a sustainable basis. The opportunities for growth identified and being actively pursued are:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials\no\nContinuation of organic growth from existing licensees.\no\nAdditional growth opportunities from signing new license agreements in new fields of use.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components\no\nIncrease the customer base for Contract Manufacture development projects, leading to long-term supply contracts.\no\nDeepen the relationship with existing customers by supplying more of their supply chain needs for current products.\no\nIntroduce existing customers to RUA IP and technology to help develop next-generation devices.\no\nIncrease market penetration of ABISS-manufactured devices through both existing and new sales channels.\n\u00b7\nStructural Heart and Vascular\no\nIncrease IP and royalty revenue from licensing RUA-developed technology (graft and heart valve).\nAs mentioned at the beginning of my report, compared to other industries, growing a medical device business can be frustratingly slow due to the necessary regulatory requirements; however, the past 12 months have been exceptional, with a doubling in the scale of the business. The new business opportunities being pursued are equally exciting and, if successful, will add further to the growing high-quality revenues.\nGeoff Berg, Chairman24 June 2025\nCONDENSED INTERIM

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nReporting entity\nRUA Life Sciences plc (\"the Company\") is a public limited company and is domiciled and incorporated in Scotland with number SC170071.\nThe Company is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (ticker: RUA, ISIN: GB0033360586)\nThe registered office is\n2 Drummond CrescentIrvineAyrshire\nKA11 5AN\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended 31 March 2025 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'the Group'). RUA Life Sciences plc is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose\nprincipal activities are contract design and manufacture of medical devices and exploiting the value of its IP and know-how.\n2.\nBasis of preparation\nThese interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 July 2024 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified and did not contain statements under sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nAs permitted, these interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK AIM Rules and UK-adopted IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". They should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, consistent with the IFRS framework adopted in UK law. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, as described in those annual financial statements.\nWhere new standards or amendments to existing standards have become effective during the year, there has been no material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.\nThe financial information is presented in pounds Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company. Balances are rounded to the nearest thousand (\u00a3'000) except where otherwise indicated.\nThese Interim\nFinancial Statements\nwere authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on 24 June 2025.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements. This included the review of financial results, internal budgets and cash flow forecasts for the period of at least 12-months following the date of approval of these interim financial statements.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the directors have considered the Group's existing working capital and are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to undertake its planned program of activities for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business activities of the Group remain those detailed on pages 22-24 of the\u00a0Annual Report 2024, a copy of which is available on the Company's website\nwww.rualifesciences.com\nProfit/(Loss) per share\nProfit/(Loss) per share has been calculated on the basis of the result for the period after tax, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the period of 62,060,272. (31 March 2024: 62,060,272).\n3.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND REVENUE ANALYSIS\nThe principal activity of the RUA Life Sciences Group comprises exploiting the value of its IP & know-how, medical device manufacturing and development of cardiovascular devices.\nFollowing the acquisition of the ABISS Group on 6th September 2024 and an internal organisation and reporting review, the Board has decided to rename the business segment formerly known as Contract Manufacturing to Medical Devices and Components to more accurately describe it. This change incorporates revenues generated from contract manufacturing of medical devices, manufacturing and sale & distribution of medical devices into a single reporting segment. This change is consistent with both how the business will be managed and be reported internally in the future.\nThe following analysis by segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (considered to be the Chief Executive Officer) to assess performance and make strategic decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental results are calculated on an IFRS basis.\nA brief description of the segments of the business is as follows:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials - Licensor of Elast-EonTM polymers to the medical device industry.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components - End-to-end contract developer, manufacturer, and seller of medical devices and implantable fabric specialist.\n\u00b7\nVascular - Development and commercialisation of the Group's Elast-Eon sealed Vascular Graft products.\n\u00b7\nStructural Heart - Development of the Group's Elast-Eon composite heart valve material AurTexTM.\nOperating results which cannot be allocated to an individual segment are recorded as central and unallocated.\nSegment revenue represents revenue from external customers arising from sale of goods and services.

Although the parent company was in liquidation, ABISS itself was not placed in receivership/liquidation. ABISS has continued to trade solvently and has traded within its own financial resources.\nThere is no future, deferred or contingent consideration due on this transaction. Further details of the acquisition are detailed in the Chairmans statement.\nAs part of the acquisition, the net identifiable assets' carrying value was determined to be \u00a3985,000, which exceeds the total consideration transferred of \u00a368,000. Consequently, a gain on a bargain purchase of \u00a3917,000 has been recognised in profit or loss as of the acquisition date.\nThis gain reflects the favourable terms of the transaction, arising primarily from the purchase through court proceedings at a value significantly below the fair value of the assets acquired.\nThe Group intends to complete the review of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities during\nthe annual reporting process for the 18-month period ending 30 September 2025\n, as permitted under IFRS 3-Business Combinations. Thus,\nthe accounting is currently provisional\n.\nDetails of the Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nDate of Acquisition: 6 September 2024\n\u00b7\nConsideration Transferred: \u00a3\n68,000\n\u00b7\nCarrying Value of Identifiable Net Assets Acquired:\n\u00a3985,000\n\u00b7\nGain on Bargain Purchase:\n\u00a3917,000\n\u00b7\nRecognition of Gain: Included under \"Other Income\" in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period ended\n31 March 2025\nThe Group continues to assess the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the ABISS transaction. As of 31 March 2025, these amounts remain provisional and may be subject to further adjustment as permitted under IFRS 3 during the measurement period. The updated provisional fair values at 31 March 2025 are as follows\n.\nDetails of the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired are as follows:\nABISS Group\nProvisionally recognised fair value on acquisition\nGB\u00a3000\nConsideration paid\n68\nLess:\nIntangible Assets\n11\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n1,015\nTrade receivables\n275\nInventory\n322\nWIP\n322\nOther Current Assets\n107\nCash\n170\nTrade payables\n(106)\nOther Current Liabilities\n(196)\nOther interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n(836)\nNon-Controlling Interest\n(99)\nCarrying value of net assets acquired\n985\nGain on bargain purchase\n917\n5.\nGOODWILL\nThe final valuation following the acquisition of RUA Medical Devices Limited gave rise to adjustments being required to the value of intangibles recognised in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 September 2020, and lead to the following goodwill being recognised:\nNo impairment review has been carried out in the six-month period.\nGB\u00a3000\nGross carrying amount\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n301\nBalance at\n31 March 2025\n301\n6.\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nDevelopment costs\nIntellectual property\nCustomer Related\nTechnology Based\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGross carrying amount\nAt 31 March 2023\n337\n3,325\n247\n141\n4,050\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAt 31 March 2024\n337\n3,325\n247\n141\n4,050\nAdditions\n391\n5\n-\n6\n402\nAt 31 March 2025\n728\n3,330\n247\n147\n4,452\nAmortisation and impairment\nAt 31 March 2023\n337\n3,114\n87\n42\n3,580\nAmortisation\n-\n8\n29\n14\n51\nAt 31 March 2024\n337\n3,122\n116\n56\n3,631\nAmortisation\n-\n12\n29\n14\n55\nImpairment\n391\n-\n-\n-\n391\nAt 31 March 2025\n728\n3,134\n145\n70\n4,077\nNet book value\nAt 31 March 2023\n-\n211\n160\n99\n470\nAt 31 March 2024\n-\n203\n131\n85\n419\nAt 31 March 2025\n-\n196\n102\n77\n375\nAs part of the acquisition of Analytic Biosurgical Solutions SAS (\"ABISS\") on 6 September 2024, the Group recognised identifiable intangible assets with a carrying value of \u00a3391,000. These assets primarily related to previously capitalised research and development expenditure.\nDuring the measurement period permitted under IFRS 3, management conducted a detailed review of the acquired intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation process.
