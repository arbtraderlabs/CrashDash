The acquisition will be funded from the Company's existing cash resources and will be paid in full on completion.\nFounded in 2000, Abiss is the legal manufacturer of a number of long term implantable devices as well as being a sub contract manufacturer of medical devices for third parties from its factory and clean room facilities in Saint Etienne, France where it has around 20 employees.\nIt is the stated objective of RUA to double the scale of its contract manufacturing business over the medium term. This opportunity, which aligns with this objective, arose when the Company was asked by a significant customer to assist in de-risking certain supply chain issues due to the insolvency of the parent company of Abiss, one of its suppliers.\nSince its creation, Abiss has promoted an innovative approach to surgical implants working closely with surgeons to develop the first sling for the treatment of female Stress Urinary Incontinence (\"SUI\") (trans obturator route) with this procedure becoming the \"gold standard\". Abiss owns the IP and has CE Mark approval for three products in the SUI field, Aris, Supris and Cyrene\u00a0which are marketed in Europe by distributors (including an Abiss 60% subsidiary in Poland). The Aris and Supris products are licensed to and manufactured for Coloplast who hold FDA approval for these products in the US. During the past three years, Abiss has successfully completed the compilation of data necessary to transition its products from the outgoing Medical Device Directive regulations to the new MDR system. Abiss has also developed a third-party contract manufacture business over the past two years. While the procedure and devices that Abiss supplies have historically been the subject of litigation and it has been a party to claims, all such claims have been settled and there are no potential claims notified or disclosed.\nThe gross assets of Abiss at 31 December 2023 were\u00a0\u20ac2,265,000. Revenue in the year to 31 December 2023 was\u00a0\u20ac2,159,000\u00a0up 36% from \u20ac1,592,000 during 2023. Loss before tax was\u00a0\u20ac352,000 after depreciation and amortisation charges of \u20ac537,000. In the year to 31 December 2023, Abiss had net positive cash flow of \u20ac223,000 and cash balances of \u20ac279,000 at the year end. Net Assets/Shareholders Funds at 31 December 2023 were \u20ac1,624,000. Non-current liabilities totalled \u20ac640,000 at 31 December 2023.\nAbiss was part of a wider medical devices group which went into insolvent liquidation in June 2021 because of Covid. Although the parent company was in liquidation, Abiss itself was not placed in receivership/liquidation. Abiss has continued to trade solvently and has traded within its own financial resources with the exception of French Government Covid support loans. The balance of these loans at 31 December 2023 was \u20ac293,000 (\u20ac418,000 in 2022) and these are being repaid over an agreed period. The nature of the transaction has precluded an extensive financial due diligence process and post-acquisition a detailed financial forecast for the Abiss business will be developed. Based on discussions with Coloplast, the board is confident that there is continuing commitment to the Abiss products and there should not be any negative impact on RUA profitability as a result of the acquisition.\nThis complementary acquisition is in line with RUA's strategy to grow and expand its Contract Manufacture business and leverages the Group's strong customer relationships and reputation for quality. It alone is expected to secure the Group's medium term growth targets and, together with the project announced on 24 July, which the group hopes to convert into a longer-term supply contract, positions the Group well to further accelerate this position. The acquisition price was set through an auction process with other interested parties not having RUA's unique position as a buyer with a strong relationship with a major customer.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated\n: \"There are many similarities between Abiss and RUA Contract Manufacture, particularly with a shared customer. Abiss has been pursuing contract manufacture opportunities to further grow its business and the combined strengths of RUA and Abiss should only increase the potential. We very much look forward to working with the Abiss team and integrating into the RUA group.\"\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, CEO\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nLachlan Smith, CFO\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCavendish\u00a0Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGiles Balleny/Dan Hodkinson\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nCharlie Combe\u00a0(Broking)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nAbout\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\nThe\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Sciences Plc\u00a0(formerly known as\u00a0AorTech International Plc) acquired\u00a0RUA Medical Devices Limited\u00a0to create a fully formed medical device business.\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0is the holding company of the Group's four trading businesses, each exploiting the Group's patented polymer technology.\nOur vision is to improve the lives of millions of patients by enabling medical devices with Elast-Eon\nTM\n, the world's leading long-term implantable polyurethane.

The introduction of segmental reporting has highlighted the benefits in financial control of separating the business units out from the parent's activities. The time is now right to formalise the process which is anticipated to bring further benefits including simplifying regulatory transparency and increasing funding options for the Group.\nThe hive downs have included the transfer of all related tangible and intangible assets (including intellectual property) of the parent Company to each of RUA Vascular Limited and RUA Structural Heart Limited. In addition, RUA Life Sciences plc will recover the costs attributable to each of the vascular graft and heart valve projects since 2018. Total attributed cost recovery for RUA Vascular is \u00a34.4 million and RUA Structural Heart is \u00a33.1 million, which will remain as an intercompany debt. This will result in RUA Life Sciences plc booking a one off trading profit of some \u00a37.5 million. This trading profit will appear in RUA Life Sciences's individual company accounts but be eliminated on consolidation of the group.\nBill Brown, Chairman of the Company, commented:\n\"\nThis transaction is an important step in RUA's journey of exploiting the clinical and commercial value of ElastEon. Two businesses have been incubated within RUA each of which is building upon the platform technology. By setting the businesses up as subsidiaries, it increases transparency and allows a deeper understanding of the value creation process.\n\"\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chairman Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCaroline Stretton, Group Managing Director Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCenkos Securities\u00a0plc\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny/Max Gould\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nAbout RUA Life Sciences\nThe RUA Life Sciences group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Sciences Plc\u00a0(formerly known as\u00a0AorTech International Plc) acquired\u00a0RUA Medical Devices Limited\u00a0to create a fully formed medical device business.

Segmental reporting of the Group is now focussed on the underlying business units and it is pleasing to report underlying net profit margins (before amortisation and taxation) of 55% for Contract Manufacture and 89% for Biomaterials. Unaudited R&D expenditure of the Group is expected to be \u00a31,070,000 (2022: \u00a3887,000), an increase of \u00a3183,000 over the preceding year, demonstrating continued investment in this area.\nOverall, loss before tax for the period is expected to be similar to last year at around \u00a32.3 to 2.4 million.\nCash resources have been prudently managed, and the balance sheet is expected to show a cash balance at the period end of \u00a31,484,000 (2022: \u00a32,963,000) with the cash burn reduced by the receipt of R&D Tax Credit payments which are accounted for on a cash basis.\nThe\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM)\nis planned for Tuesday 22 August 2023. A further notice of meeting announcement will be made in due course.\nBusiness Segments\nThe two core technologies of the RUA group are implantable textile expertise and the Intellectual Property within the ElastEon family of biomaterials. The business is managed on a portfolio basis with four operating segments each of which is exploiting one or both core technologies.\nRUA Biomaterials\nRUA Biomaterials continues to enjoy steady growth with unaudited revenues increasing 14% to \u00a3554,000. Revenues are derived from royalty and license fees associated with the Elast-Eon technology. Direct costs within this business are minimal and the business segment enjoyed high net margins of 89%. RUA considers the cash flows from the business segment as a \"growing perpetuity\" which at a discount rate of 12% and growth of rate 5% would value this business segment at around \u00a37 million.\nRUA Contract Manufacture\nThis business segment represents the third-party contract manufacturing activities acquired with RUA Medical in 2020\n. This business has enjoyed very good growth during the year with unaudited revenue increasing\n43% to \u00a31,625,000. Net profit margins of 55% are generated within the business unit and it continues to meet and exceed customer expectations for quality, efficiency and value for money. New and existing customers are actively reviewing projects with RUA that could double the current scale of the business over a two-year period. For review and investment purposes, management value this business on an EBITDA multiple having observed the very attractive multiples that medical device contract manufacture commands.\nRUA Vascular\nAs previously reported, RUA has been undertaking a \"pre-sub\" with the FDA and RUA is delighted to report that agreement has very recently been reached with the FDA on protocols for a GLP animal trial and a human clinical trial of the RUA vascular graft. This has been a lengthy process but felt to be worthwhile as it limits the risk of the FDA asking for additional information or testing after submission. During this period of discussion with the FDA, RUA has taken the opportunity to undertake additional development and testing on the graft range with a view to improving performance and maximising manufacturing yields. A detailed work plan has been prepared for the agreed testing regime and quotations received from third party test houses for the required work. The clinical study will involve around 120 patients and further details regarding the costings and timings of this work will be announced in due course.\nThe other major development in the period was signing the distribution agreement with Corcym allowing direct hospital sales to be made on regulatory approval.\nRUA Structural Heart\nThe objectives for RUA Structural Heart for the period was to evaluate heart valve leaflet material and compare the performance of 100% polymeric valves with a novel composite developed by the Group. The computational modelling of the composite material at the design stage suggested that its mechanical properties would be ideal for heart valve leaflets and that there should not be a risk of delamination. The team within the Structural Heart business segment has very recently achieved the initial milestones set for the composite material. The Structural Heart team has achieved the initial milestones set for the composite material and we are delighted to report that after 200 million cycles the material shows no signs of delamination and cut edges remain unchanged as a result of flex fatigue. From a performance perspective, the composite material is very thin and flexible and little energy is required to open a valve and once opened does not restrict blood flow with a good EOA (Effective Orifice Area). Testing has also demonstrated that the properties of the composite restrict crack growth even in damaged leaflets.\n100% polymeric valves rely in part on the leaflet design to reduce stress and operate within the performance window of the polymer meaning that polymer would not work in all designs. The composite material retains the blood contacting properties of Elast-Eon but is significantly stronger. This creates the opportunity for RUA Structural Heart to become a supplier of heart valve leaflets to other companies to incorporate in current designs.\nBill Brown, Chairman of the Company, commented:\n\"\nRUA has a portfolio of four businesses, all of which have made good progress during the period. The mature businesses are growing revenue and generating attractive net margins and the development business segments of Vascular and Structural Heart have made good regulatory and technological progress respectively on relatively low levels of investment.\n\"\nCaroline Stretton, Group Managing Director, added:\n\"\nThis period has seen continuing sales growth from our two cash generative and highly profitable business units, RUA Biomaterials and RUA Contract Manufacturing, which underpin current Group valuation. We have continued to\nde-risk the regulatory process and formalised the route to market for RUA Vascular's graft range, and identified additional positive properties within RUA Structural Heart's\npolymeric heart valve technology platform\"\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chairman Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCaroline Stretton, Group Managing Director Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCenkos Securities\u00a0plc\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny/Max Gould\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nAbout RUA Life Sciences\nThe RUA Life Sciences group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Sciences Plc\u00a0(formerly known as\u00a0AorTech International Plc) acquired\u00a0RUA Medical Devices Limited\u00a0to create a fully formed medical device business.
