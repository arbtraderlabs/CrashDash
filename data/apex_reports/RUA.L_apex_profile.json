This extended reporting period is a result of the previously reported decision to extend the Company's financial year end from 31 March to 30 September.\nTrading update\nOver the period, the Group has made substantial progress in growing from a Research and Development-focused business to a mature revenue-generating business, as demonstrated by the very encouraging results below.\nRevenue\nThe Group expects to report revenues for the 18-month period of \u00a36.6 million compared to the \u00a32.2 million reported for 12 months to March 2024. Adjusting for the extended reporting period, revenues were \u00a34.4 million on a pro-rata basis and \u00a35.1 million for the final 12 months of the period.\nThis strong increase in revenue has been driven by a switch in focus from R&D activities to commercial activity. The key contributors were:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties - increased from \u00a30.5 million for the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a30.9 million for the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 80%.\n\u00b7\nUK-based Contract Manufacturing business grew revenues from \u00a31.7 million in the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a33.5 million in the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 105%.\n\u00b7\nAbiss group, the French based medical device manufacturer acquired by the Group in September 2024 generated revenues of \u00a32.2 million in the 12 months to September 2025.\nCustomer Concentration\nThe UK based Contract Manufacture business (UKCM) historically generated around 95% of its revenue from one major customer. Substantial efforts have been made to seek to grow and diversify the customer base by numbers and value. In the final six months of the reporting period, customer concentration was reduced with 54% from the largest customer, 33% from the new supply contract announced in January this year and 13% from business development activity that if projects are successful could drive the revenue growth of the future.\nPath to profitability\nIn 12 months to March 2024, the group sustained an operating loss of \u00a31.9 million and EBITDA loss of \u00a31.6m (adjusted for non-cash share based payments). An objective of management at the start of the period was to get the Group to breakeven and through to profitability in as short a period as possible.\nAt the second Interim period for the 12 months to March 2025, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5 million profit was reported after benefiting from the \u00a30.9 million bargain purchase gain on the Abiss acquisition. It is anticipated that when taken for the full 18 month period to September 2025 the Group will continue to be EBITDA positive.\nCash control\nIn the year to March 2024, cash utilisation within the Group amounted to \u00a31.5 million, reflecting the EBITDA loss for that period. As previously reported, cash utilisation for the 12 months to March 2025 was substantially reduced to around \u00a3400k with period end cash balances of \u00a33.5 million. The Group expects to report cash at 30 September 2025 of \u00a33.2 million however the net cash reduction is expected to be represented by increased working capital requirements as a result of the growth in scale of the Group.\nReporting timetable\nFollowing the change of accounting reference date announced on\u00a030 October 2024, publication of full audited accounts for the 18-month period ending\u00a030 September 2025 is expected\u00a0by end of\u00a0January 2026.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated:\n\"The growth achieved by RUA over the past 18 months has been exceptional demonstrated both by the revenues reported and by the ever growing opportunities with existing and new customers.

As previously announced to shareholders, the Company extended its reporting period to 30 September 2025, and the full 18 month period report and accounts will be published during January 2026. These interim accounts do, however, cover a year's trading at RUA and, compared to the previous year-end results, demonstrate the substantial progress made during the year.\nThe focus of the business over the past twelve months has been to increase the size and scale of our medical device and component manufacturing business whilst keeping a tight control over costs. Growing a medical device business in the short term is not straightforward as customer decisions and timelines are driven by strict regulatory considerations rather than shorter term financial objectives. Although frustrating compared to other industries, the compensation tends to be the attractive margins achievable and the longer term nature of supply contracts.\nAgainst this general industry background, the results are encouraging.\nRevenue\nIn the year to 31 March 2025, Group revenues grew by 88% from \u00a32,191k to \u00a34,113k, achieving much of our 2-3 year objective to double revenues within the period. All of the revenue-generating business units have contributed to this growth, with Biomaterials growing 18% from \u00a3496k to \u00a3587k, the Medical Device and Components business increasing 110% from \u00a31,679k to \u00a33,526k. Of this growth, \u00a3550k (33%) was contributed by the UK Contract Manufacture business. On 6 September 2024, the Group acquired the business of ABISS France, and in the period from the acquisition to 31 March 2025, contributed further revenue of \u00a31,296k.\nGross Profit\nOver the period, gross profits increased by 79% from \u00a31,776k to \u00a33,172k. The Gross Margin, however, fell from 81% to 77% over the period. This reduction is partly due to the Biomaterials business, on which gross margins remain at over 94%, being diluted by the faster-growing contract manufacturing business. The margins were also depressed by the integration of ABISS Group. The underlying margin in both the Biomaterials and UK Contract manufacture business increased during the period, but the Gross Margin recognised at ABISS during the period was a lower 68% reflecting on consolidation the fair value of work in progress held on the date of acquisition. The normal gross margin at ABISS has historically been around 75% and is expected to return to those levels in the medium term.\nOther Income\nOther income is represented in the main by the bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of ABISS. Having concluded the fair value calculation of the assets and liabilities of ABISS, the gain amounts to \u00a3917k. Of this gain \u00a3322k reflects the recognition of the work in progress, the attributed value of which had the resultant depressing impact on gross margin recognised on consolidation.\nCosts\nA key objective is to control the costs within the business. Over the period, administration costs increased by 10% to \u00a34,161. This increase is represented by the overheads within the acquired ABISS business of \u00a3757k and savings made within the UK business as a result of an organisational restructure enabling higher levels of activity and efficiency.\nBreak-even for the period\nAs a result of tight cost control, growth in revenues and the initial benefits of the ABISS acquisition, a small post-tax profit of \u00a31k was achieved compared to a loss of \u00a31,440k in the comparative 12 month period.\nCash\nOver the 12 months to March, the business saw consolidated cash balances reduce from \u00a33.9m to \u00a33.6m, representing cash consumption of \u00a30.3m. This reduced level of cash burn demonstrates improved cost control, and management is committed to further reducing cash burn over the remaining six months of the financial period to September 2025.\nAcquisition of ABISS\nOn acquisition, RUA paid \u00a368k for the entire issued share capital of ABISS (France), together with a 60% interest in ABISS (Poland), a distributor of ABISS-manufactured medical devices. The (preliminary) fair value of the identified net assets on acquisition has been adjusted to \u00a3985k, resulting in a bargain purchase gain of \u00a3917k.\nABISS is the legal manufacturer of pelvic floor repair devices under CE Mark and a subcontract manufacturer of the same devices for a US manufacturer. ABISS was purchased with a short-term order backlog, which was fulfilled in the period. However overall, inventory levels at ABISS's customer had been increased to levels higher than required due to the supply chain risk as a result of the status of the former parent of ABISS. There will be a period of reduced orders as this excess inventory is worked through the system. However, ABISS is not anticipated to be a drag on the Group during this period.\nThere are\nstructural changes in the competitive landscape\nwithin the\nEuropean pelvic floor device\nmarket, driven by two of the market's major players. One has withdrawn entirely from the European market, while another has transferred its product portfolio to a business with no current European presence. The structural impact is believed to affect around 70% of an estimated market of more than \u20ac25 million. These products will still require to be sourced by hospitals. ABISS 's customers should benefit from this opportunity, but ABISS is also seeking to expand its distribution networks for its own product range. ABISS has manufacturing capacity to supply a significantly larger market share, and as an indication of the operational gearing within the business, it has historically achieved a 30% net margin on revenues of over \u20ac3 million.\nBusiness review\nSince the equity fund raise in December 2023, significant progress has been made by the business in its objectives of growing the contract manufacturing business and controlling costs. The progress and potential have been accelerated through the purchase of ABISS and deepening relationships with major customers allowing a shorter pathway to profitability. Over the same period, little of the progress made by the Company has been reflected in the share price, and indeed it has not progressed from the heavily discounted price of the fund raise.\nThe business had previously been pursuing a strategy of developing its own devices to bring to market, however, the ability to exploit these business areas was prohibited by the quantity of capital and the cost of that capital. The strategy was therefore switched to focus on the biomaterials and contract manufacturing part of the business.\nWe believe that the historical investment in both grafts and heart valve material will result in revenues to the group through a combination of licensing income and device/component manufacturing revenues. It is however counterproductive to have market expectations based on the potential to exploit IP at a time when the Company is marketing and negotiating potential contracts. Rather than provide a commentary of developments, we will focus on reporting the outcomes of deals once completed.\nFocus for growth\nRUA has been profitable on an occasional monthly basis over the period and is much closer to our objectives of being profitable on a sustainable basis. The opportunities for growth identified and being actively pursued are:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials\no\nContinuation of organic growth from existing licensees.\no\nAdditional growth opportunities from signing new license agreements in new fields of use.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components\no\nIncrease the customer base for Contract Manufacture development projects, leading to long-term supply contracts.\no\nDeepen the relationship with existing customers by supplying more of their supply chain needs for current products.\no\nIntroduce existing customers to RUA IP and technology to help develop next-generation devices.\no\nIncrease market penetration of ABISS-manufactured devices through both existing and new sales channels.\n\u00b7\nStructural Heart and Vascular\no\nIncrease IP and royalty revenue from licensing RUA-developed technology (graft and heart valve).\nAs mentioned at the beginning of my report, compared to other industries, growing a medical device business can be frustratingly slow due to the necessary regulatory requirements; however, the past 12 months have been exceptional, with a doubling in the scale of the business. The new business opportunities being pursued are equally exciting and, if successful, will add further to the growing high-quality revenues.\nGeoff Berg, Chairman24 June 2025\nCONDENSED INTERIM

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nReporting entity\nRUA Life Sciences plc (\"the Company\") is a public limited company and is domiciled and incorporated in Scotland with number SC170071.\nThe Company is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (ticker: RUA, ISIN: GB0033360586)\nThe registered office is\n2 Drummond CrescentIrvineAyrshire\nKA11 5AN\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended 31 March 2025 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'the Group'). RUA Life Sciences plc is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose\nprincipal activities are contract design and manufacture of medical devices and exploiting the value of its IP and know-how.\n2.\nBasis of preparation\nThese interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 July 2024 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified and did not contain statements under sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nAs permitted, these interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK AIM Rules and UK-adopted IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". They should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, consistent with the IFRS framework adopted in UK law. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, as described in those annual financial statements.\nWhere new standards or amendments to existing standards have become effective during the year, there has been no material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.\nThe financial information is presented in pounds Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company. Balances are rounded to the nearest thousand (\u00a3'000) except where otherwise indicated.\nThese Interim\nFinancial Statements\nwere authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on 24 June 2025.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements. This included the review of financial results, internal budgets and cash flow forecasts for the period of at least 12-months following the date of approval of these interim financial statements.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the directors have considered the Group's existing working capital and are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to undertake its planned program of activities for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business activities of the Group remain those detailed on pages 22-24 of the\u00a0Annual Report 2024, a copy of which is available on the Company's website\nwww.rualifesciences.com\nProfit/(Loss) per share\nProfit/(Loss) per share has been calculated on the basis of the result for the period after tax, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the period of 62,060,272. (31 March 2024: 62,060,272).\n3.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND REVENUE ANALYSIS\nThe principal activity of the RUA Life Sciences Group comprises exploiting the value of its IP & know-how, medical device manufacturing and development of cardiovascular devices.\nFollowing the acquisition of the ABISS Group on 6th September 2024 and an internal organisation and reporting review, the Board has decided to rename the business segment formerly known as Contract Manufacturing to Medical Devices and Components to more accurately describe it. This change incorporates revenues generated from contract manufacturing of medical devices, manufacturing and sale & distribution of medical devices into a single reporting segment. This change is consistent with both how the business will be managed and be reported internally in the future.\nThe following analysis by segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (considered to be the Chief Executive Officer) to assess performance and make strategic decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental results are calculated on an IFRS basis.\nA brief description of the segments of the business is as follows:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials - Licensor of Elast-EonTM polymers to the medical device industry.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components - End-to-end contract developer, manufacturer, and seller of medical devices and implantable fabric specialist.\n\u00b7\nVascular - Development and commercialisation of the Group's Elast-Eon sealed Vascular Graft products.\n\u00b7\nStructural Heart - Development of the Group's Elast-Eon composite heart valve material AurTexTM.\nOperating results which cannot be allocated to an individual segment are recorded as central and unallocated.\nSegment revenue represents revenue from external customers arising from sale of goods and services. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.\nThe Group's revenue from continuing operations to destinations outside the UK amounted to 100% (year to 31 March 2024: 100%). The revenue analysis below is based on the region of registration of the customer:\nThe Group's revenue for 12 months to 31 March 2025 is segmented as follows:\nAnalysis of revenue by income stream\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nBiomaterials\nMedical Devices & Components\nVascular\nStructural Heart\nCentral and unallocated\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nManufacture and sale of\nMedical Devices\n-\n3,526\n-\n-\n-\n3,526\nRoyalty revenue\n587\n-\n-\n-\n-\n587\nTotal\n587\n3,526\n-\n-\n-\n4,113\nAnalysis of revenue by geographical location\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nBiomaterials\nMedical Devices & Components\nVascular\nStructural Heart\nCentral and unallocated\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nEurope\n159\n524\n-\n-\n-\n683\nNorth America\n377\n2,981\n-\n-\n-\n3,358\nMiddle East\n51\n-\n-\n-\n-\n51\nAsia Pacific\n0\n20\n0\n0\n0\n20\nAfrica\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\nTotal\n587\n3,526\n-\n-\n-\n4,113\nThe Group's revenue for 12 months to 31 March 2024 is segmented as follows:\nAnalysis of revenue by income stream\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nBiomaterials\nMedical Devices & Components\nVascular\nStructural Heart\nCentral and unallocated\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nManufacture and sale of\nMedical Devices\n-\n1,679\n16\n-\n-\n1,695\nRoyalty revenue\n496\n-\n-\n-\n-\n496\nTotal\n496\n1,679\n16\n-\n-\n2,191\nAnalysis of revenue by geographical location\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nBiomaterials\nMedical Devices & Components\nVascular\nStructural Heart\nCentral and unallocated\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nEurope\n158\n38\n-\n-\n-\n196\nNorth America\n288\n1,641\n16\n-\n-\n1,945\nMiddle East\n50\n-\n-\n-\n-\n50\nAsia Pacific\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAfrica\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n496\n1,679\n16\n-\n-\n2,191\nThe Group's Segmental analysis for 12 months to 31 March 2025 is segmented as follows:\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nBiomaterials\nMedical Devices & Components\nVascular\nStructural Heart\nCentral and unallocated\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nConsolidated group revenues from external customers\n587\n3,526\n-\n-\n-\n4,113\nContributions to group operating loss\n553\n166\n(672)\n(426)\n359\n(20)\nDepreciation\n-\n267\n82\n14\n3\n366\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n-\n47\n-\n-\n8\n55\nSegment assets\n293\n4,063\n665\n114\n4,120\n9,255\nSegment liabilities\n6\n1,242\n233\n5\n377\n1,863\nIntangible assets - goodwill\n-\n301\n-\n-\n-\n301\nOther intangible assets\n-\n180\n139\n-\n56\n375\nAdditions to non-current assets\n-\n38\n2\n3\n19\n62\nAdditions to non-current assets represent capital expenditure incurred by the Group during the reporting period, including purchases of property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets arising from new lease arrangements.

Although the parent company was in liquidation, ABISS itself was not placed in receivership/liquidation. ABISS has continued to trade solvently and has traded within its own financial resources.\nThere is no future, deferred or contingent consideration due on this transaction. Further details of the acquisition are detailed in the Chairmans statement.\nAs part of the acquisition, the net identifiable assets' carrying value was determined to be \u00a3985,000, which exceeds the total consideration transferred of \u00a368,000. Consequently, a gain on a bargain purchase of \u00a3917,000 has been recognised in profit or loss as of the acquisition date.\nThis gain reflects the favourable terms of the transaction, arising primarily from the purchase through court proceedings at a value significantly below the fair value of the assets acquired.\nThe Group intends to complete the review of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities during\nthe annual reporting process for the 18-month period ending 30 September 2025\n, as permitted under IFRS 3-Business Combinations. Thus,\nthe accounting is currently provisional\n.\nDetails of the Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nDate of Acquisition: 6 September 2024\n\u00b7\nConsideration Transferred: \u00a3\n68,000\n\u00b7\nCarrying Value of Identifiable Net Assets Acquired:\n\u00a3985,000\n\u00b7\nGain on Bargain Purchase:\n\u00a3917,000\n\u00b7\nRecognition of Gain: Included under \"Other Income\" in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period ended\n31 March 2025\nThe Group continues to assess the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the ABISS transaction. As of 31 March 2025, these amounts remain provisional and may be subject to further adjustment as permitted under IFRS 3 during the measurement period. The updated provisional fair values at 31 March 2025 are as follows\n.\nDetails of the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired are as follows:\nABISS Group\nProvisionally recognised fair value on acquisition\nGB\u00a3000\nConsideration paid\n68\nLess:\nIntangible Assets\n11\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n1,015\nTrade receivables\n275\nInventory\n322\nWIP\n322\nOther Current Assets\n107\nCash\n170\nTrade payables\n(106)\nOther Current Liabilities\n(196)\nOther interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n(836)\nNon-Controlling Interest\n(99)\nCarrying value of net assets acquired\n985\nGain on bargain purchase\n917\n5.\nGOODWILL\nThe final valuation following the acquisition of RUA Medical Devices Limited gave rise to adjustments being required to the value of intangibles recognised in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 September 2020, and lead to the following goodwill being recognised:\nNo impairment review has been carried out in the six-month period.\nGB\u00a3000\nGross carrying amount\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n301\nBalance at\n31 March 2025\n301\n6.\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nDevelopment costs\nIntellectual property\nCustomer Related\nTechnology Based\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGross carrying amount\nAt 31 March 2023\n337\n3,325\n247\n141\n4,050\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAt 31 March 2024\n337\n3,325\n247\n141\n4,050\nAdditions\n391\n5\n-\n6\n402\nAt 31 March 2025\n728\n3,330\n247\n147\n4,452\nAmortisation and impairment\nAt 31 March 2023\n337\n3,114\n87\n42\n3,580\nAmortisation\n-\n8\n29\n14\n51\nAt 31 March 2024\n337\n3,122\n116\n56\n3,631\nAmortisation\n-\n12\n29\n14\n55\nImpairment\n391\n-\n-\n-\n391\nAt 31 March 2025\n728\n3,134\n145\n70\n4,077\nNet book value\nAt 31 March 2023\n-\n211\n160\n99\n470\nAt 31 March 2024\n-\n203\n131\n85\n419\nAt 31 March 2025\n-\n196\n102\n77\n375\nAs part of the acquisition of Analytic Biosurgical Solutions SAS (\"ABISS\") on 6 September 2024, the Group recognised identifiable intangible assets with a carrying value of \u00a3391,000. These assets primarily related to previously capitalised research and development expenditure.\nDuring the measurement period permitted under IFRS 3, management conducted a detailed review of the acquired intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation process. It was determined that the assets did not possess standalone commercial value.
