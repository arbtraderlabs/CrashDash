The longer reporting period results from the Company's decision to change its year-end from March to September, providing additional time to integrate the Abiss acquisition and to align our reporting cycle with that of a major customer to support improved planning. The financial results for the period to 30 September 2025 are presented below together with the strategic and organisational progress achieved by the Company. Throughout the Report and Accounts, reported revenues and expense items relate to an 18-month period, whilst prior period comparatives are for the 12 months to 31 March 2024.\nBackground\nI concluded my statement last year by observing that RUA had recently switched from a business with funding required to finance the needs of R&D projects to a financially strong business focussed on growth, cash generation and profitability. It is against this background that we set out this report.\nTrading for Year\nThe headline trading results demonstrate that RUA has made exceptional progress towards its objectives of growth and profitability. Revenue grew over threefold from \u00a32.19 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a36.69 million in the 18 month period to September 2025. Losses before tax reduced from \u00a32.02 million to \u00a30.24 million a reduction of 86%.\nThe Abiss acquisition added customers, capability and momentum and, on completion, generated a non-recurring bargain-purchase gain of \u00a30.9m. While that item lifts the reported result, the direction of travel is clear, a larger, better-balanced business moving toward sustainable profitability.\nAs set out in the Strategic Report below, the improved trading is a result of growth in Contract Manufacture and the acquisition of Abiss together with tight cost control and the elimination of certain roles within the Group.\nNet cash outflow excluding proceeds from share issues was much reduced from the \u00a31.49 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a30.66 million for the 18-month period to September 2025. It is pleasing that in the final six months of the period, there was a net cash inflow from operating activities meeting the objective of reaching a position of cash generation from trading.\nCash balances at 30 September 2025 remained strong at \u00a33.25 million after having repaid a mortgage of \u00a30.11 million on the Drummond Crescent factory unit.\nIndustry Drivers\nIn the last interim report, I discussed the long-term nature of the medical device industry. The industry in many areas is dominated by large corporations which tend to be risk averse and often leave true innovation to smaller, entrepreneurial organisations but later acquire that innovation once proven.\nThe regulatory environment is also highly structured, both for demonstrating the necessary safety and efficacy to obtain an initial marketing authority, and also for the additional submissions required if there is a change to a device. Against this background, progress in the industry is typically slow; however, when it does occur, it can generate high value, attractive margins and strong barriers to entry, reflecting the substantial investment required to bring a product to market and sustain it.\nAchieving growth as a contract manufacturer of devices or licensor of technology is long-term in nature, as it follows the market penetration of the device.\nThe focus on commerciality over the past two years has not only positioned RUA well to grow alongside its partners but has brought a number of early-stage contract development opportunities that engage the R&D team and have set the foundations for future manufacturing revenues.\nFuture Drivers\nAs the business has come through the transition from being R&D to commercially focussed, revenue growth will be driven by an integrated contract development and manufacturing business working closely with partners at all stages of their product lifecycles. In addition, the business owns a substantial IP portfolio in polymers, composite materials and manufacturing processes that will drive licensing and component supply opportunities.\nConclusion\nThe two year objectives set at the time of the 2023 Strategy Review, of doubling revenues, reducing cash burn and focussing on profitability have been achieved ahead of time through strong trading and the purchase of the Abiss subsidiary in France. We look forward to building upon this success through broadening both services for current customers and expanding the customer base further.\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nG\nroup Performance\nThe Group entered the financial period with an emphasis towards growth, profitability and cash generation. This short term commercial focus represented a significant change from previous, longer term ambitions of growing infrastructure to support R&D activities to having a short term commercial focus. At the point of this transition, a number of senior roles were eliminated from the business with total annualised payroll savings of over \u00a30.6 million. The executive leadership team was restructured and empowered to deliver on the Group objectives. Reflecting upon the objectives set for the business, they were ambitious and stretching and the progress made over the past 18 months is a significant achievement by the team.\nThe financial performance over the period of this report has seen a substantial improvement in the position of the Group, driven by growth in customer engagement, cost control and strategic acquisitions.\nAs the shape and focus of the business has changed it is an opportune time to summarise what the key activities of the Group are:\n\u00b7\nWe develop components and finished devices under contract for customers.\n\u00b7\nWe manufacture devices and components for customers under long term contracts.\n\u00b7\nWe manufacture, market and distribute our own medical devices through Abiss.\n\u00b7\nWe develop medical device and component IP in house using our talented and experienced team of engineers.\n\u00b7\nWe license our IP to industry partners to enable their devices.\nAs mentioned in the Chairman's Statement, product development in the medical device industry can be slow but there are a number of attractions in becoming established and embedded in these development projects:\n\u00b7\nHigh barriers to entry, both technical and regulatory.\n\u00b7\nHigh margin potential from both device and component supply.\n\u00b7\nLong product lifecycles: 10-20 years providing long term revenue visibility.\nRUA operates in a long term industry with high value outcomes on success. Developing a new medical device or implant is a structured, multi-year process. Each phase of development is designed to ensure product safety, reliability and regulatory compliance and can typically take from five to eight years for a device to be approved. The key stages and activities in this process are:\n\u00b7\nPhase 1 - Research and Feasibility\nEarly scientific research is undertaken and prototypes are developed. This can involve up to 2 years work.\n\u00b7\nPhase 2 - Design and Development\nEngineering work is undertaken to turn prototypes into finished devices and testing of those devices is performed. Again this is typically a 2 year period.\n\u00b7\nPhase 3 - Clinical studies\nStudies to ensure device safety and performance with timescales determined by the study design but typically over a one to two year period.\n\u00b7\nPhase 4 - Regulatory dossier submission\nReview and clearance activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals.\nOnce approved, the device will be launched onto the market and volume manufacture is required. A succesful device can have a lifespan of 10-20 years. Any change to the device or manufacturing process can require parts of these steps to be undertaken again.\nRUA is a Contract Developer and Manufacturer of medical devices and components and we need to be engaged with customers at the appropiate stage of their device lifecycle. Our marketing approach has been to partner with customers at the Design and Development stage of their projects, becoming a key part of their R&D process (and budget) and partnering to become the manufacturer of either components or finished devices once Regulatory Approval has been achieved. Additionally, we recognised that during the product marketing phase, supply chain risks appear and customers may be let down by other external suppliers. RUA is becoming recognised as a problem solver, working succesfuly with customers to avoid product shortages.\nThe spectacular growth we have enjoyed in our contracting business, termed Medical Devices and Components, over the past 18 months has been a result of our reputation for quality, innovation and agility, drawing customers to RUA when they have a problem that needs to be solved. The new material project announced in July 2024 and the acquisition of Abiss in September 2024 were examples of our ability to support these needs..\nImportantly, RUA is now contracted on several earlier stage projects at or beyond the Design and Development stage of device lifecycles. This will ensure additional revenue from engineering services and future device or component supply.\nIP Exploitation\nRUA has developed a substantial IP portfolio in house with potential and opportunities to further exploit.\nThe areas of IP are:\n\u00b7\nThe world leading, long term implantable polyurethane - Elast-EonTM.\n\u00b7\nPolymer processing technology to convert textile into an Elast-Eon composite - AurTexTM.\n\u00b7\nMechanical testing data suite on AurTex with indications for use in multiple areas.\n\u00b7\nPolymer heart valve technology and data including AurTex and Elast-Eon as leaflet material.\n\u00b7\nA fully designed and developed polymer coated vascular graft together with agreed FDA protocol for clinical studies.\n\u00b7\nA technical file ready for approval on a next generation single incision mini-sling for treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI).\n\u00b7\nRegulatory approved mesh devices for pelvic floor disorders.\n\u00b7\nNext generation material as alternative to mesh/tape in SUI.\nElast-Eon\nThe reporting period has seen a growth in our IP related revenue from \u00a30.49 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a30.91 million in the current 18 month period. On a like for like basis this is a 24% increase year on year. This is all related to Biomaterials and the licensing of Elast-Eon. There are growth indicators within this area with good performance from established devices in the market together with customer products currently at Design/Development/Regulatory stages that can lead to growth in licence and royalty fees.\nStructural Heart\nOver the past 18 months, we have continued selective investment in our AurTex material and its application for heart valve leaflets. This work has been in support of a serious interest in AurTex for a specific heart valve need. The development work is showing promise, and we hope to make further progress during the current period. The Board's objective is to move future activities in this area off book whilst being able to recognise value created to date.\nVascular\nNo further investment is being made in this area. Some of the technology developed has enabled early stage revenues for our Contract Design and Development business with contracts for supply of crimping services and coated grafts supplied as components for further processing. It has been a disapointment that we have to date not succeeded in finding a partner to take on the regulatory burden of bringing the graft range to market.\nAbiss\nThis business was purchased to ensure that the supply of a range of products to a major customer remained secure. Future product strategy is being discussed with the customer, and the results of those discussions will drive how certain IP within Abiss will be exploited in the future. We have been encouraged by the depth of product IP within Abiss and are seeking to build upon it for the benefit of both the Abiss business and the wider Group.\nWithin the IP of the Group, there are at least four product ranges or even potential businesses that can be developed. Our strategy is to find partners willing to support each project with RUA providing Contract Development and Manufacturing services for a financial return through royalties or otherwise on the provision of the initial IP.\nOutlook\nLast year, we set the expectation of growing Biomaterials licence income as well as engaging with customers to double the scale of our Contract Manufacturing business. We were succesful in meeting those expectations and intend to grow each of those areas further during the current year. In addition, a key focus of management will be to exploit further the considerable IP portfolio within the business.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe focus of the period has been to grow the established businesses of Biomaterials and Contract Manufacture, which enjoy strong contractual revenue streams and generate attractive net margins. Ambitious targets were set for the Group at the start of the period, and it is positive that we have been able to perform in line with these expectations. The period under review is an extended 18 months to 30 September 2025 as a result of the change in year-end. The corresponding results for last year represent the 12 months to 31 March 2024 and, as such, are not directly comparable.\nRevenue\nGroup revenue for the 18-month period ended 30 September 2025 was \u00a36.7 million compared to the 12 months to 31 March 2024 of \u00a32.2 million. The period benefited from strong organic growth together with the first-time contribution from the acquisition of Abiss..\nRevenue by segment\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and ComponentsUK Operations: \u00a33.6 million (53% of Group revenue). On a like for like basis this represents 41 % growth from higher volumes and demand together with new business from new and existing customers.\nEU Operations: (Abiss Group): \u00a32.2 million (33% of Group revenue). New contribution in the period, broadening the Group's revenue base and adding complementary manufacturing income.\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials: \u00a30.9 million (14% of Group revenue). This area grew from the \u00a30.5 million reported last year representing annualised growth of 20%.Performance remained resilient, despite the stronger Sterling versus US Dollar exchange rate during parts of the period.\nOverall, the revenue profile is now more diversified, with\nMedical Devices and Components (UK and Abiss combined) representing c.86% of Group revenue and Biomaterials c.14%, positioning the Group for more balanced growth going into the next period.\nAcquisition of Abiss\nOn 6th September 2024, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Abiss France SAS, a France-based medical device group, for cash consideration of \u00a368k.\nThe acquisition provides the Group with an established manufacturing and development platform in continental Europe, broadens its medical device product offering and customer base, and is expected to generate operational and commercial synergies across the Group.\nA fair value adjustment to align the identified assets and liabilities of Abiss to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, including adjustments to inventory, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and provisions has resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of \u00a30.9 million being recognised.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nFor the 18 months to 30 September 2025, general and administrative (G&A) expenses were \u00a36.5 million (12 months to 31 March 2024: \u00a33.8 million, not directly comparable due to the extended reporting period and business mix). The 2025 figure includes 13 months of the Abiss Group.\nDepreciation & amortisation: \u00a30.7 million (c.10.2% of G&A) vs \u00a30.4 million in 2024 (c.9.6%).\nCost control remains a management focus. Throughout 2025, we tightened budgeting and approval processes, enhanced spend visibility, and strengthened financial controls across the Group (including Abiss). These actions improved oversight of operating costs and are intended to support a more efficient run-rate going forward.\nResearch and development costs\nAs first outlined in November 2023, the Group continued to re-prioritise resources away from pre-commercial R&D toward near-term profitability and customer delivery.For the 18 months to 30 September 2025, the Group expensed \u00a30.4 million of Research & Development costs (12 months to 31 March 2024: \u00a30.9 million). The lower spend is a consequence of our strategy to redeploy expenditure away from long term development projects.\nNo development costs were capitalised in the period; all amounts were expensed to the income statement as they relate primarily to early-stage development activities, where the technical feasibility, commercial viability and timing of future revenues are not yet sufficiently certain to meet the criteria for capitalisation.\nConsistent with commitments made at the 2023 fundraise, we intend to reduce R&D expenditure further over the next 12 months, concentrating only on projects that demonstrably support profitable growth or are directly funded by third parties.\nShare-based payment charges\nThe business operates share option plans for key personnel, which incurred a charge for share-based payment expenses of \u00a3171,000 for the period compared to a credit of \u00a335,000 in 2024. The non-cash credit in 2024 is attributed to a writeback related to the cancellation of share option awarded to two executives who left the Group during the year to 31 March 2024.\nNet finance costs\nFor the 18 months to 30 September 2025, the Group recorded net finance income of \u00a321,000 (12 months to 31 March 2024: net finance costs \u00a383,000)\nThe improvement reflects interest earned on surplus cash held in a low-risk liquidity fund during the period and the repayment of borrowings.\nThis figure is net of unrealised foreign exchange losses of \u00a331,000 (2024: \u00a328,000).\nLosses before taxation\nIn the year to 31 March 2024, the Group incurred a pre tax loss of \u00a32.0m, The trading improvements and Abiss acquisition referred to above contributed to a much reduced loss of \u00a30.2m in the 18 month period to 30 September 2025. This loss includes the effect of a \u00a30.9 million non-cash gain on bargain purchase from the Abiss acquisition. Excluding this item, the underlying loss before tax was \u00a31.1 million. The periods are not directly comparable due to the move from a 12-month to an 18-month reporting period and the acquisition of Abiss during the period.\nLoss per share\nBasic and diluted loss per share for the period was 0.35 pence (2024: 4.29 pence).\nTaxation\nThe Group claims research and development tax credits each year and, since it is currently loss making, elects to surrender these tax credits for a cash rebate. The amount is included within the taxation line of the consolidated income statement in respect of amounts receivable for the surrender of research and development expenditure amounting to \u00a30.4m (2024: \u00a30.9m). The Group has not recognised any tax assets in respect of trading losses arising in the current financial year or accumulated losses in previous financial years.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA, which includes non-cash share-based payment expenses, improved \u00a32.0million to a positive \u00a30.4 million in the period (FY24: loss \u00a31.6 million) as a result of the improvement in revenue volumes and gross margin and gain on bargain purchase from the acquisition of the Abiss Group.\nCashflow\nClosing cash at 30 September was \u00a33.2 million (2024: \u00a33.9 million)\nCash preservation remains a strategic objective. Throughout the year, operating cash outflows from operations amounted to \u00a30.2 million (2024: \u00a31.3 million), reflecting the financial activities and commitments required to sustain business operations and growth initiatives.\nThe business invested \u00a3161,000 in capital expenditure during the year (2024: \u00a355,000), Spend remained tightly controlled and focused on essential replacement and maintenance, with no significant new capital projects undertaken, reflecting our ongoing cash preservation and cost discipline strategy.\nFinancial position\nDuring the year, the Group completed the acquisition of Abiss, a French medical device business, marking a significant strategic step in expanding our capabilities and market reach. Our financial position remains robust, with net assets at 30 September 2025 of \u00a37.1 million (2024: \u00a37.2 million).\nIntangible assets (not including Goodwill) reduced to \u00a30.3 million (2024: \u00a30.4 million), reflecting an amortisation charge of \u00a382,000, partially offset by \u00a311,000 of intangibles acquired with the Abiss Group.\nDividends\nNo dividends have been proposed for the period ended 30 September 2025 (2024: \u00a3nil).\nSTRATEGY\nThe mission of the Group is to be a long-term trusted partner to the medical device industry through specialisation in implantable textiles and biostable polymers and related technology. This is being undertaken through:\n\u00b7\nInternational growth via licensing Elast-Eon to third parties through RUA Biomaterials;\n\u00b7\nInternational growth through Medical Devices and Components businesses exploiting implantable textiles expertise;\n\u00b7\nPartnering with other parties to exploit and monetise the substantial Intellectual Property developed within the Group.\nRUA Life Sciences will seek to maximise shareholder value by growing each business to achieve attractive levels of profitability or disposing of business areas if the valuations are attractive.\nSummarised

incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The registered head office is 2 Drummond Crescent, Riverside Business Park, Irvine, Ayrshire, KA11 5AN.\nThe Company (together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\") was under the control of the directors throughout the period covered in the financial statements. The list of the subsidiaries consolidated in the financial statements is shown in Note xx.\nThe principal activity of the Group is exploiting the value of its IP & know-how, medical device contract manufacturing and development of cardiovascular devices.\n1.\nBasis of preparation and status of financial information\nThe financial information set out in this preliminary announcement does not constitute statutory accounts as defined by section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information for the period ended 30 September 2025 and the year ended 31 March 2024 does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for those years. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The statutory accounts for the period ended 30 September 2025 were approved by the Board on 10 November 2025 and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course. The statutory accounts for the period ended 30 September 2025 will be posted to shareholders at least 21 days before the Annual General Meeting and made available on the Group's website.\nThe Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2025, from which the financial information presented in this announcement has been extracted, were prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards (\"IFRS\"). The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of certain items, which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the principal accounting policies set out in the Group's Annual Report. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event, or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nThe auditor's reports on the accounts for 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2024 were unqualified and did not contain a statement under 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\n2.\nSignificant accounting policies - Going concern\nAt 30 September 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a33.25 million. As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the Group's cash and cash equivalents were approximately \u00a32.8 million\nThe Directors have prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows looking beyond 12 months from the date of the approval of these financial statements. In developing these forecasts, the Directors have made assumptions based upon their view of the current and future economic conditions that will prevail over the forecast period.\nThe cash flow predictions are based on a period of closely controlled cash flows to maintain ongoing development at a level commensurate with our means. Third party sources of funding are being explored to accelerate the development of our vascular graft portfolio and structural heart technology, in line with our corporate objectives.\nThe Directors estimate that the cash held by the Group together with known receivables will be sufficient to support the planned level of activities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (being a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report), and for this reason, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n3. Revenue\nGroup revenue for the period was \u00a36.7 million (2024: \u00a32.2 million). The current period covers an 18-month reporting period, compared with a 12-month comparative period, and therefore, the results are not directly comparable. In addition, the increase in revenue reflects the inclusion of revenue from businesses acquired during the period. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the extended reporting period and acquisitions, underlying revenue performance was broadly in line with management expectations.\nRevenue analysed by class of business\nPeriod ended\nYear ended\n30 September 2025\n31 March 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContract Design & Manufacture of Medical Devices\n5,775\n1,695\nRoyalty revenue\n914\n496\nTotal\n6,689\n2,191\nRevenue analysed by geographical market\nPeriod ended\nYear ended\n30 September 2025\n31 March 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nEurope\n1,173\n196\nNorth America\n5,396\n1,945\nMiddle East\n81\n50\nAsia Pacific\n37\n-\nAfrica\n2\n-\nTotal\n6,689\n2,191\n4. Other income\nOther income for the period includes a gain on bargain purchase arising on the acquisition of Abiss France SAS, reflecting the excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired over the consideration transferred. The gain arose due to the distressed circumstances of the vendor following the insolvency of its ultimate parent company.\nPeriod ended\nYear ended\n30 September 2025\n31 March 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nGovernment Grants\n44\n63\nRental Income\n28\n13\nGain On Bargain Purchase\n895\n-\nMiscellaneous Income\n47\n3\nTotal\n1,014\n79\n5. Acquisitions\nOn 6 September 2024, the Group acquired 100% of Abiss France SAS for cash consideration of \u00a368k and, through this acquisition, obtained indirect control of Abiss Poland sp. z o.o., in which Abiss France holds a 60% interest. A non-controlling interest was recognised in respect of the remaining 40% held by minority shareholders.\nThe acquisition resulted in a gain on bargain purchase, reflecting the distressed circumstances of the vendor following the insolvency of Abiss France's ultimate parent company. The transaction price was further influenced by the business's reliance on a single major customer and the limited pool of potential acquirers. The Group's existing technical capability, regulatory expertise and established customer relationship enabled it to complete the acquisition at a price below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nFrom the acquisition date to 30 September 2025, Abiss contributed revenue of \u00a32.2m and a loss before tax of \u00a30.2m to the Group. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2024, Group revenue for the 18-month period would have been \u00a37.6m with a loss before tax of \u00a30.6m. Fair value adjustments reflect the alignment of acquired assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.\n6.\nPreliminary announcement\nThe summary accounts set out above do not constitute statutory accounts as defined by section 434 of the UK Companies Act 2006. The summarised consolidated statement of financial position at\u00a030 September 2025, the summarised consolidated income statement, the summarised consolidated cash flow statement and the summarised consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended have been extracted from the Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended\u00a030 September 2025\u00a0upon which the auditor's opinion is unqualified and did not contain a statement under either sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. The audit report for the year ended\u00a030 September 2025\u00a0did not contain statements under sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory financial statements for the year ended\u00a031 March 2024\u00a0have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The\u00a030 September 2025 accounts were approved by the Directors on\n29 January 2026, but have not yet been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\n7.\nEarnings per share\nThe basic and diluted loss per ordinary share of\u00a00.35 pence\u00a0(2024: loss of\u00a04.29 pence) is calculated on the loss of the Group of\u00a0\u00a3218,000\u00a0(2024: loss of\u00a0\u00a31,440,000\u00a0) and on\n62,060,272\n(2024:\n33,546,577\n)\u00a0ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.\n8.

This extended reporting period is a result of the previously reported decision to extend the Company's financial year end from 31 March to 30 September.\nTrading update\nOver the period, the Group has made substantial progress in growing from a Research and Development-focused business to a mature revenue-generating business, as demonstrated by the very encouraging results below.\nRevenue\nThe Group expects to report revenues for the 18-month period of \u00a36.6 million compared to the \u00a32.2 million reported for 12 months to March 2024. Adjusting for the extended reporting period, revenues were \u00a34.4 million on a pro-rata basis and \u00a35.1 million for the final 12 months of the period.\nThis strong increase in revenue has been driven by a switch in focus from R&D activities to commercial activity. The key contributors were:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties - increased from \u00a30.5 million for the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a30.9 million for the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 80%.\n\u00b7\nUK-based Contract Manufacturing business grew revenues from \u00a31.7 million in the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a33.5 million in the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 105%.\n\u00b7\nAbiss group, the French based medical device manufacturer acquired by the Group in September 2024 generated revenues of \u00a32.2 million in the 12 months to September 2025.\nCustomer Concentration\nThe UK based Contract Manufacture business (UKCM) historically generated around 95% of its revenue from one major customer. Substantial efforts have been made to seek to grow and diversify the customer base by numbers and value. In the final six months of the reporting period, customer concentration was reduced with 54% from the largest customer, 33% from the new supply contract announced in January this year and 13% from business development activity that if projects are successful could drive the revenue growth of the future.\nPath to profitability\nIn 12 months to March 2024, the group sustained an operating loss of \u00a31.9 million and EBITDA loss of \u00a31.6m (adjusted for non-cash share based payments). An objective of management at the start of the period was to get the Group to breakeven and through to profitability in as short a period as possible.\nAt the second Interim period for the 12 months to March 2025, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5 million profit was reported after benefiting from the \u00a30.9 million bargain purchase gain on the Abiss acquisition. It is anticipated that when taken for the full 18 month period to September 2025 the Group will continue to be EBITDA positive.\nCash control\nIn the year to March 2024, cash utilisation within the Group amounted to \u00a31.5 million, reflecting the EBITDA loss for that period. As previously reported, cash utilisation for the 12 months to March 2025 was substantially reduced to around \u00a3400k with period end cash balances of \u00a33.5 million. The Group expects to report cash at 30 September 2025 of \u00a33.2 million however the net cash reduction is expected to be represented by increased working capital requirements as a result of the growth in scale of the Group.\nReporting timetable\nFollowing the change of accounting reference date announced on\u00a030 October 2024, publication of full audited accounts for the 18-month period ending\u00a030 September 2025 is expected\u00a0by end of\u00a0January 2026.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated:\n\"The growth achieved by RUA over the past 18 months has been exceptional demonstrated both by the revenues reported and by the ever growing opportunities with existing and new customers. This has been a true team effort and I am very grateful to everyone within the RUA Group for their contribution.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the\u00a0UK\u00a0version of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (2014/596), which is part of\u00a0UK\u00a0law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chief Executive Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nLachlan Smith, Group\u00a0Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nGiles Balleny/Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nHarriet Ward (Broking)\nNigel Birks (Healthcare Specialist Sales)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nAbout RUA Life Sciences\nRUA Life Sciences plc\u00a0is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose principal activities comprise exploiting the value\nof its IP & know-how, medical device contract manufacturing and development of medical devices.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As previously announced to shareholders, the Company extended its reporting period to 30 September 2025, and the full 18 month period report and accounts will be published during January 2026. These interim accounts do, however, cover a year's trading at RUA and, compared to the previous year-end results, demonstrate the substantial progress made during the year.\nThe focus of the business over the past twelve months has been to increase the size and scale of our medical device and component manufacturing business whilst keeping a tight control over costs. Growing a medical device business in the short term is not straightforward as customer decisions and timelines are driven by strict regulatory considerations rather than shorter term financial objectives. Although frustrating compared to other industries, the compensation tends to be the attractive margins achievable and the longer term nature of supply contracts.\nAgainst this general industry background, the results are encouraging.\nRevenue\nIn the year to 31 March 2025, Group revenues grew by 88% from \u00a32,191k to \u00a34,113k, achieving much of our 2-3 year objective to double revenues within the period. All of the revenue-generating business units have contributed to this growth, with Biomaterials growing 18% from \u00a3496k to \u00a3587k, the Medical Device and Components business increasing 110% from \u00a31,679k to \u00a33,526k. Of this growth, \u00a3550k (33%) was contributed by the UK Contract Manufacture business. On 6 September 2024, the Group acquired the business of ABISS France, and in the period from the acquisition to 31 March 2025, contributed further revenue of \u00a31,296k.\nGross Profit\nOver the period, gross profits increased by 79% from \u00a31,776k to \u00a33,172k. The Gross Margin, however, fell from 81% to 77% over the period. This reduction is partly due to the Biomaterials business, on which gross margins remain at over 94%, being diluted by the faster-growing contract manufacturing business. The margins were also depressed by the integration of ABISS Group. The underlying margin in both the Biomaterials and UK Contract manufacture business increased during the period, but the Gross Margin recognised at ABISS during the period was a lower 68% reflecting on consolidation the fair value of work in progress held on the date of acquisition. The normal gross margin at ABISS has historically been around 75% and is expected to return to those levels in the medium term.\nOther Income\nOther income is represented in the main by the bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of ABISS. Having concluded the fair value calculation of the assets and liabilities of ABISS, the gain amounts to \u00a3917k. Of this gain \u00a3322k reflects the recognition of the work in progress, the attributed value of which had the resultant depressing impact on gross margin recognised on consolidation.\nCosts\nA key objective is to control the costs within the business. Over the period, administration costs increased by 10% to \u00a34,161. This increase is represented by the overheads within the acquired ABISS business of \u00a3757k and savings made within the UK business as a result of an organisational restructure enabling higher levels of activity and efficiency.\nBreak-even for the period\nAs a result of tight cost control, growth in revenues and the initial benefits of the ABISS acquisition, a small post-tax profit of \u00a31k was achieved compared to a loss of \u00a31,440k in the comparative 12 month period.\nCash\nOver the 12 months to March, the business saw consolidated cash balances reduce from \u00a33.9m to \u00a33.6m, representing cash consumption of \u00a30.3m. This reduced level of cash burn demonstrates improved cost control, and management is committed to further reducing cash burn over the remaining six months of the financial period to September 2025.\nAcquisition of ABISS\nOn acquisition, RUA paid \u00a368k for the entire issued share capital of ABISS (France), together with a 60% interest in ABISS (Poland), a distributor of ABISS-manufactured medical devices. The (preliminary) fair value of the identified net assets on acquisition has been adjusted to \u00a3985k, resulting in a bargain purchase gain of \u00a3917k.\nABISS is the legal manufacturer of pelvic floor repair devices under CE Mark and a subcontract manufacturer of the same devices for a US manufacturer. ABISS was purchased with a short-term order backlog, which was fulfilled in the period. However overall, inventory levels at ABISS's customer had been increased to levels higher than required due to the supply chain risk as a result of the status of the former parent of ABISS. There will be a period of reduced orders as this excess inventory is worked through the system. However, ABISS is not anticipated to be a drag on the Group during this period.\nThere are\nstructural changes in the competitive landscape\nwithin the\nEuropean pelvic floor device\nmarket, driven by two of the market's major players. One has withdrawn entirely from the European market, while another has transferred its product portfolio to a business with no current European presence. The structural impact is believed to affect around 70% of an estimated market of more than \u20ac25 million. These products will still require to be sourced by hospitals. ABISS 's customers should benefit from this opportunity, but ABISS is also seeking to expand its distribution networks for its own product range. ABISS has manufacturing capacity to supply a significantly larger market share, and as an indication of the operational gearing within the business, it has historically achieved a 30% net margin on revenues of over \u20ac3 million.\nBusiness review\nSince the equity fund raise in December 2023, significant progress has been made by the business in its objectives of growing the contract manufacturing business and controlling costs. The progress and potential have been accelerated through the purchase of ABISS and deepening relationships with major customers allowing a shorter pathway to profitability. Over the same period, little of the progress made by the Company has been reflected in the share price, and indeed it has not progressed from the heavily discounted price of the fund raise.\nThe business had previously been pursuing a strategy of developing its own devices to bring to market, however, the ability to exploit these business areas was prohibited by the quantity of capital and the cost of that capital. The strategy was therefore switched to focus on the biomaterials and contract manufacturing part of the business.\nWe believe that the historical investment in both grafts and heart valve material will result in revenues to the group through a combination of licensing income and device/component manufacturing revenues. It is however counterproductive to have market expectations based on the potential to exploit IP at a time when the Company is marketing and negotiating potential contracts. Rather than provide a commentary of developments, we will focus on reporting the outcomes of deals once completed.\nFocus for growth\nRUA has been profitable on an occasional monthly basis over the period and is much closer to our objectives of being profitable on a sustainable basis. The opportunities for growth identified and being actively pursued are:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials\no\nContinuation of organic growth from existing licensees.\no\nAdditional growth opportunities from signing new license agreements in new fields of use.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components\no\nIncrease the customer base for Contract Manufacture development projects, leading to long-term supply contracts.\no\nDeepen the relationship with existing customers by supplying more of their supply chain needs for current products.\no\nIntroduce existing customers to RUA IP and technology to help develop next-generation devices.\no\nIncrease market penetration of ABISS-manufactured devices through both existing and new sales channels.\n\u00b7\nStructural Heart and Vascular\no\nIncrease IP and royalty revenue from licensing RUA-developed technology (graft and heart valve).\nAs mentioned at the beginning of my report, compared to other industries, growing a medical device business can be frustratingly slow due to the necessary regulatory requirements; however, the past 12 months have been exceptional, with a doubling in the scale of the business. The new business opportunities being pursued are equally exciting and, if successful, will add further to the growing high-quality revenues.\nGeoff Berg, Chairman24 June 2025\nCONDENSED INTERIM

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nReporting entity\nRUA Life Sciences plc (\"the Company\") is a public limited company and is domiciled and incorporated in Scotland with number SC170071.\nThe Company is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (ticker: RUA, ISIN: GB0033360586)\nThe registered office is\n2 Drummond CrescentIrvineAyrshire\nKA11 5AN\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended 31 March 2025 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'the Group'). RUA Life Sciences plc is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose\nprincipal activities are contract design and manufacture of medical devices and exploiting the value of its IP and know-how.\n2.\nBasis of preparation\nThese interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 July 2024 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified and did not contain statements under sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nAs permitted, these interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK AIM Rules and UK-adopted IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". They should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, consistent with the IFRS framework adopted in UK law. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, as described in those annual financial statements.\nWhere new standards or amendments to existing standards have become effective during the year, there has been no material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.\nThe financial information is presented in pounds Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company. Balances are rounded to the nearest thousand (\u00a3'000) except where otherwise indicated.\nThese Interim\nFinancial Statements\nwere authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on 24 June 2025.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements. This included the review of financial results, internal budgets and cash flow forecasts for the period of at least 12-months following the date of approval of these interim financial statements.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the directors have considered the Group's existing working capital and are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to undertake its planned program of activities for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business activities of the Group remain those detailed on pages 22-24 of the\u00a0Annual Report 2024, a copy of which is available on the Company's website\nwww.rualifesciences.com\nProfit/(Loss) per share\nProfit/(Loss) per share has been calculated on the basis of the result for the period after tax, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the period of 62,060,272. (31 March 2024: 62,060,272).\n3.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND REVENUE ANALYSIS\nThe principal activity of the RUA Life Sciences Group comprises exploiting the value of its IP & know-how, medical device manufacturing and development of cardiovascular devices.\nFollowing the acquisition of the ABISS Group on 6th September 2024 and an internal organisation and reporting review, the Board has decided to rename the business segment formerly known as Contract Manufacturing to Medical Devices and Components to more accurately describe it. This change incorporates revenues generated from contract manufacturing of medical devices, manufacturing and sale & distribution of medical devices into a single reporting segment. This change is consistent with both how the business will be managed and be reported internally in the future.\nThe following analysis by segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (considered to be the Chief Executive Officer) to assess performance and make strategic decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental results are calculated on an IFRS basis.\nA brief description of the segments of the business is as follows:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials - Licensor of Elast-EonTM polymers to the medical device industry.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components - End-to-end contract developer, manufacturer, and seller of medical devices and implantable fabric specialist.\n\u00b7\nVascular - Development and commercialisation of the Group's Elast-Eon sealed Vascular Graft products.\n\u00b7\nStructural Heart - Development of the Group's Elast-Eon composite heart valve material AurTexTM.\nOperating results which cannot be allocated to an individual segment are recorded as central and unallocated.\nSegment revenue represents revenue from external customers arising from sale of goods and services.

Although the parent company was in liquidation, ABISS itself was not placed in receivership/liquidation. ABISS has continued to trade solvently and has traded within its own financial resources.\nThere is no future, deferred or contingent consideration due on this transaction. Further details of the acquisition are detailed in the Chairmans statement.\nAs part of the acquisition, the net identifiable assets' carrying value was determined to be \u00a3985,000, which exceeds the total consideration transferred of \u00a368,000. Consequently, a gain on a bargain purchase of \u00a3917,000 has been recognised in profit or loss as of the acquisition date.\nThis gain reflects the favourable terms of the transaction, arising primarily from the purchase through court proceedings at a value significantly below the fair value of the assets acquired.\nThe Group intends to complete the review of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities during\nthe annual reporting process for the 18-month period ending 30 September 2025\n, as permitted under IFRS 3-Business Combinations. Thus,\nthe accounting is currently provisional\n.\nDetails of the Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nDate of Acquisition: 6 September 2024\n\u00b7\nConsideration Transferred: \u00a3\n68,000\n\u00b7\nCarrying Value of Identifiable Net Assets Acquired:\n\u00a3985,000\n\u00b7\nGain on Bargain Purchase:\n\u00a3917,000\n\u00b7\nRecognition of Gain: Included under \"Other Income\" in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period ended\n31 March 2025\nThe Group continues to assess the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the ABISS transaction. As of 31 March 2025, these amounts remain provisional and may be subject to further adjustment as permitted under IFRS 3 during the measurement period. The updated provisional fair values at 31 March 2025 are as follows\n.\nDetails of the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired are as follows:\nABISS Group\nProvisionally recognised fair value on acquisition\nGB\u00a3000\nConsideration paid\n68\nLess:\nIntangible Assets\n11\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n1,015\nTrade receivables\n275\nInventory\n322\nWIP\n322\nOther Current Assets\n107\nCash\n170\nTrade payables\n(106)\nOther Current Liabilities\n(196)\nOther interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n(836)\nNon-Controlling Interest\n(99)\nCarrying value of net assets acquired\n985\nGain on bargain purchase\n917\n5.\nGOODWILL\nThe final valuation following the acquisition of RUA Medical Devices Limited gave rise to adjustments being required to the value of intangibles recognised in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 September 2020, and lead to the following goodwill being recognised:\nNo impairment review has been carried out in the six-month period.\nGB\u00a3000\nGross carrying amount\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n301\nBalance at\n31 March 2025\n301\n6.\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nDevelopment costs\nIntellectual property\nCustomer Related\nTechnology Based\nTotal\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGB\u00a3000\nGross carrying amount\nAt 31 March 2023\n337\n3,325\n247\n141\n4,050\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAt 31 March 2024\n337\n3,325\n247\n141\n4,050\nAdditions\n391\n5\n-\n6\n402\nAt 31 March 2025\n728\n3,330\n247\n147\n4,452\nAmortisation and impairment\nAt 31 March 2023\n337\n3,114\n87\n42\n3,580\nAmortisation\n-\n8\n29\n14\n51\nAt 31 March 2024\n337\n3,122\n116\n56\n3,631\nAmortisation\n-\n12\n29\n14\n55\nImpairment\n391\n-\n-\n-\n391\nAt 31 March 2025\n728\n3,134\n145\n70\n4,077\nNet book value\nAt 31 March 2023\n-\n211\n160\n99\n470\nAt 31 March 2024\n-\n203\n131\n85\n419\nAt 31 March 2025\n-\n196\n102\n77\n375\nAs part of the acquisition of Analytic Biosurgical Solutions SAS (\"ABISS\") on 6 September 2024, the Group recognised identifiable intangible assets with a carrying value of \u00a3391,000. These assets primarily related to previously capitalised research and development expenditure.\nDuring the measurement period permitted under IFRS 3, management conducted a detailed review of the acquired intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation process.

This extended reporting period is a result of the previously reported decision to extend the Company's financial year end from 31 March to 30 September.\nTrading update\nOver the period, the Group has made substantial progress in growing from a Research and Development-focused business to a mature revenue-generating business, as demonstrated by the very encouraging results below.\nRevenue\nThe Group expects to report revenues for the 18-month period of \u00a36.6 million compared to the \u00a32.2 million reported for 12 months to March 2024. Adjusting for the extended reporting period, revenues were \u00a34.4 million on a pro-rata basis and \u00a35.1 million for the final 12 months of the period.\nThis strong increase in revenue has been driven by a switch in focus from R&D activities to commercial activity. The key contributors were:\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties - increased from \u00a30.5 million for the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a30.9 million for the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 80%.\n\u00b7\nUK-based Contract Manufacturing business grew revenues from \u00a31.7 million in the 12 months to March 2024 to \u00a33.5 million in the 18 months to September 2025, representing total growth of 105%.\n\u00b7\nAbiss group, the French based medical device manufacturer acquired by the Group in September 2024 generated revenues of \u00a32.2 million in the 12 months to September 2025.\nCustomer Concentration\nThe UK based Contract Manufacture business (UKCM) historically generated around 95% of its revenue from one major customer. Substantial efforts have been made to seek to grow and diversify the customer base by numbers and value. In the final six months of the reporting period, customer concentration was reduced with 54% from the largest customer, 33% from the new supply contract announced in January this year and 13% from business development activity that if projects are successful could drive the revenue growth of the future.\nPath to profitability\nIn 12 months to March 2024, the group sustained an operating loss of \u00a31.9 million and EBITDA loss of \u00a31.6m (adjusted for non-cash share based payments). An objective of management at the start of the period was to get the Group to breakeven and through to profitability in as short a period as possible.\nAt the second Interim period for the 12 months to March 2025, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5 million profit was reported after benefiting from the \u00a30.9 million bargain purchase gain on the Abiss acquisition. It is anticipated that when taken for the full 18 month period to September 2025 the Group will continue to be EBITDA positive.\nCash control\nIn the year to March 2024, cash utilisation within the Group amounted to \u00a31.5 million, reflecting the EBITDA loss for that period. As previously reported, cash utilisation for the 12 months to March 2025 was substantially reduced to around \u00a3400k with period end cash balances of \u00a33.5 million. The Group expects to report cash at 30 September 2025 of \u00a33.2 million however the net cash reduction is expected to be represented by increased working capital requirements as a result of the growth in scale of the Group.\nReporting timetable\nFollowing the change of accounting reference date announced on\u00a030 October 2024, publication of full audited accounts for the 18-month period ending\u00a030 September 2025 is expected\u00a0by end of\u00a0January 2026.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated:\n\"The growth achieved by RUA over the past 18 months has been exceptional demonstrated both by the revenues reported and by the ever growing opportunities with existing and new customers. This has been a true team effort and I am very grateful to everyone within the RUA Group for their contribution.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the\u00a0UK\u00a0version of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (2014/596), which is part of\u00a0UK\u00a0law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chief Executive Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nLachlan Smith, Group\u00a0Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nGiles Balleny/Isaac Hooper (Corporate Finance)\nHarriet Ward (Broking)\nNigel Birks (Healthcare Specialist Sales)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nAbout RUA Life Sciences\nRUA Life Sciences plc\u00a0is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose principal activities compr",

As previously announced to shareholders, the Company extended its reporting period to 30 September 2025, and the full 18 month period report and accounts will be published during January 2026. These interim accounts do, however, cover a year's trading at RUA and, compared to the previous year-end results, demonstrate the substantial progress made during the year.\nThe focus of the business over the past twelve months has been to increase the size and scale of our medical device and component manufacturing business whilst keeping a tight control over costs. Growing a medical device business in the short term is not straightforward as customer decisions and timelines are driven by strict regulatory considerations rather than shorter term financial objectives. Although frustrating compared to other industries, the compensation tends to be the attractive margins achievable and the longer term nature of supply contracts.\nAgainst this general industry background, the results are encouraging.\nRevenue\nIn the year to 31 March 2025, Group revenues grew by 88% from \u00a32,191k to \u00a34,113k, achieving much of our 2-3 year objective to double revenues within the period. All of the revenue-generating business units have contributed to this growth, with Biomaterials growing 18% from \u00a3496k to \u00a3587k, the Medical Device and Components business increasing 110% from \u00a31,679k to \u00a33,526k. Of this growth, \u00a3550k (33%) was contributed by the UK Contract Manufacture business. On 6 September 2024, the Group acquired the business of ABISS France, and in the period from the acquisition to 31 March 2025, contributed further revenue of \u00a31,296k.\nGross Profit\nOver the period, gross profits increased by 79% from \u00a31,776k to \u00a33,172k. The Gross Margin, however, fell from 81% to 77% over the period. This reduction is partly due to the Biomaterials business, on which gross margins remain at over 94%, being diluted by the faster-growing contract manufacturing business. The margins were also depressed by the integration of ABISS Group. The underlying margin in both the Biomaterials and UK Contract manufacture business increased during the period, but the Gross Margin recognised at ABISS during the period was a lower 68% reflecting on consolidation the fair value of work in progress held on the date of acquisition. The normal gross margin at ABISS has historically been around 75% and is expected to return to those levels in the medium term.\nOther Income\nOther income is represented in the main by the bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of ABISS.

This additional reporting period results from the previously announced decision to change the Company's financial year end from 31 March to 30 September.\nTrading update\nThe strategic focus of the Group over the period has been to grow the contract manufacturing business and exploit the IP developed within the Group's businesses. The trading results set out below demonstrate the strong progress made over the past year.\nRevenue\nThe Group expects to report substantial 12 month revenue growth from \u00a32.2m in FY24 to \u00a34.1m in the Period. This growth of 86% is a result of strong trading in the underlying business together with the acquisition of the Abiss Group announced on 9 September 2024.\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties - increased 19% over the period from \u00a3496k to \u00a3586k.\n\u00b7\nMedical Devices and Components - increased 106% from \u00a31.7m to \u00a33.5m\no\nOriginal RUA Contract Manufacturing revenues increased 32% from \u00a31.7m to \u00a32.2m\n\u00b7\nAbiss - revenues of \u00a31.3m for the period since acquisition on 9 September 2024\nCosts\nContinued strong focus on cost control resulted in a 22% reduction in like-for-like costs (excluding Abiss costs for the Period) from \u00a33.8 million to \u00a33.0 million. Including the costs within Abiss, total Group costs reduced 3% to \u00a33.7m.\nCash control\nCash at 31 March 2025 reduced c5% to \u00a33.7m (2024: \u00a33.9m), representing a significantly reduced cash utilisation from the \u00a31.5m used in the year to March 2024.\nEBITDA for the period\nThe Group expects to report an EBITDA of c\u00a30.3m compared to an EBITDA loss of \u00a31.6m for the same period last year.\nOutlook\nMedical Devices and Components\nContract Manufacture\nThe CDMO business currently presents the greatest short-term opportunities for the Group, building on the progress made over the past 12 months. The pipeline of new business prospects continues to grow, but most excitingly, the Group is actively pursuing an opportunity to combine our textiles expertise with ElastEon to create a novel device for a global device company. This opportunity is only available due to the unique IP developed within the Group over the last few years.\nAbiss\nAbiss is the legal manufacturer of medical devices for pelvic floor devices under CE Mark and a subcontract manufacturer of the same devices for a US manufacturer. Abiss was purchased with a short-term order backlog, which has now been fulfilled. Inventory levels at Abiss's customer had been increased to levels higher than required due to the supply chain risk as a result of the status of the former parent of Abiss. It is expected that there will be a period of reduced orders as this excess inventory is worked through the system. However, Abiss should not be a drain on the Group during this period. There are structural changes within the market, with two of the major competitors changing the landscape. One has withdrawn from the European market in total, while another has transferred its product portfolio to another business with no European presence. It is still too early to forecast the implications, but they should be positive for Abiss.\nBiomaterials\nThe growth enjoyed over the past year is anticipated to continue with prospects for increased royalties from existing licensees, together with potential near term new licenses for Elast-Eon in new therapeutic areas under discussion with a major device manufacturer.\nVascular\nThe Group is no longer actively pursuing funding/partners to take the range of vascular grafts through the remaining regulatory pathway. Several opportunities have, however, presented for the supply of the graft product or technology developed as components for other devices. These opportunities will be exploited through the Contract Manufacture business.\nStructural Heart\nRecent discussions have suggested that the RUA team have achieved something that other groups have not succeeded in by creating a fibre reinforced material that is flexible enough to operate as a heart valve leaflet. Further characterisation work is nearing completion to provide data for a large valve company on the impact of \"aging\" AurTexTM on its mechanical properties. Interest in AurTex has been expressed by various parties, both in heart valve use and other therapeutic areas, but all discussions are at an early stage.\nReporting timetable\nFollowing the change of accounting reference date announced on 30 October 2024, publication of full unaudited accounts for the 12-month period ending 31 March 2025 is expected to occur in m",

These challenges were overcome post-acquisition resulting in trading income being weighted heavily towards the final quarter of the year to 31 December 2024. The management accounts of ABISS covering the year to December have now been prepared and reviewed. At 31 December, shareholders' funds (net asset value) amounted to \u20ac1.6 million. Total revenues of \u20ac2.3 million were achieved, representing growth of 7% over the year to December 2023. A profit before tax of \u20ac46k was recorded compared to a loss of \u20ac352k in the prior year, and after adding back depreciation charges, EBITDA increased 147% from \u20ac185k to \u20ac457k. Due to the supply chain challenges, the pretax loss of ABISS for the 9 months to September amounted to around \u20ac450k however as, stated above, this was remedied with the result that the final quarter generated a profit of approximately \u20ac500k.\nBudgets and business planning are currently being undertaken with expectations for further revenue growth driven by increasing demand in Europe for ABISS's Cyrene product range.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated\n:\n\"Abiss is demonstrating itself to be a very high-quality business, and the combination with RUA allows a number of strategic opportunities to be pursued in further developing the group.\n\"\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, CEO\nLachlan Smith, CFO\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCavendish\u00a0Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGiles Balleny/Dan Hodkinson\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nCharlie Combe\u00a0(Broking)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nAbout\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\nThe\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Sciences Plc\u00a0(formerly known as\u00a0AorTech International Plc) acquired\u00a0RUA Medical Devices Limited\u00a0to create a fully formed medical device business.\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0is the holding company of the Group's four trading businesses, each exploiting the Group's patented polymer technology.\nOur vision is to improve the lives of millions of patients by enabling medical devices with Elast-Eon\nTM\n, the world's leading long-term implantable polyurethane.

I am pleased to report good progress towards this goal during the six months ended 30 September 2024 (the \"period\"), along with the establishment of strong foundations for future growth.\nOn 6 September 2024, the Group completed the strategic acquisition of the Abiss Group, a medical device manufacturer based in France, with a subsidiary in Poland specialising in the distribution of medical devices. The results presented include the consolidation of the Abiss group from the date of acquisition.\nTaking into account the progress made on delivering on strategy and the initial benefits of the strategic acquisition of Abiss, it is pleasing to be able to report a consolidated profit of \u00a3636,000 for the period.\nUnaudited interim results for the six months to 30 September 2024\nConsolidated revenues for the Group increased 92% from \u00a3794k to \u00a31,524k in the period. Of the revenues achieved, \u00a3238k (H1 2023 \u00a3199k) was represented by the Group's Biomaterials business, which enjoyed year-on-year growth of 20%. Other revenues delivered from the sale of Medical Devices and Components increased 116% from \u00a3595k to \u00a31,286k in the period.\nIt is recognised that revenues in the comparative period were adversely affected by delays in shipments which were recovered in the second half of the year. A more appropriate comparator is the average revenues across each of the two half years in FY24 of \u00a3840k. Against this more challenging comparator, revenue growth from the Sale of Medical Devices and Components was 53% including the benefit of the Abiss group or 47% on a like-for-like basis.\nGross Profit margins continued to improve from the 78% achieved in the first half of FY24 and 81% over FY24, to 83% in the period. The gross profit margin achieved from Medical Devices and Components was 80% in the period compared to 76% in the comparative period.\nAdministrative expenses were reduced by \u00a3326k (16%) from \u00a32,020k (H1 24) to \u00a31,694k in the first half of the current year. The like-for-like reduction in costs (excluding Abiss) was \u00a3375k.\nIncluded in other income for the period is the initial bargain purchase gain from the acquisition of the Abiss group. The profit on acquisition is \u00a31,062,000, representing the excess of the book value of assets acquired over the purchase price of \u00a368,000. An exercise to calculate the fair value of assets purchased, including any intangible assets identifiable, is currently being undertaken, and the final acquisition accounting adjustments will be included in the second interim period to 31 March 2025.

This growth is stated before the benefit of the Group's acquisition of the Abiss Group announced on 9 September 2024.\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties for the period from Elast-Eon increased to \u00a3237k, representing year-on-year growth of 19% (H1 2024: \u00a3199k)\n\u00b7\nContract Manufacture revenues for the period increased to \u00a31,247k. This represents a 110% increase over the depressed H1 revenues reported last year. Like for like growth over normalised revenues last year was 49%.\nCost Control\nCosts in the period of approximately \u00a31.6 million benefited from stringent cost control measures and are expected to be down by approximately 25% on those incurred in H1 2024.\nCash\nCash and cash equivalents at 30 September 2024 were \u00a33.5m compared to \u00a33.9m at 31 March 2024 (H1 2024: \u00a30.5m)\nProfit for the period\nThe Group is expected to announce a pre-tax profit of \u00a30.4m for the period compared to a loss of \u00a31.4m last year.\nThis turnaround is attributed to the increased revenues and cost control described above together with, as described in more detail below, other income of \u00a30.9m on consolidation of Abiss.\nRUA Vascular and Structural Heart\nThe objective for RUA Vascular and Structural Heart is to find alternative ways to fund the remaining regulatory pathway for the polymer sealed graft products and to introduce the Group's heart valve leaflet material (AurTex) to the wider industry as a realistic alternative to animal tissue in heart valves. The teams working on these projects have continued to make good progress with significant improvements made in the handling of the graft to address feedback from potential partners.\nIn addition, the AurTex material has positively advanced in both manufacturing consistency and testing milestones. The materials tested under the\nCompany's\nMaterial Transfer Agreement (\"MTA\") with a heart valve company have successfully met all the expected results for the tests undertaken; however, at this point, it is not expected to lead to a commercial agreement due to current priorities of the Company's MTA partner. Notwithstanding this, the results of the MTA have confirmed the management's belief in the potential for AurTex.\nSeveral opportunities are being pursued for each of the Vascular and Structural Heart businesses, and further updates will be made as appropriate.\nAcquisition of ABISS\nOn 6 September 2024, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Abiss (France) and its 60% subsidiary, Abiss (Poland), (together the \"Abiss Group\"). The sale of the Abiss Group was conducted as an auction by the court appointed liquidator of the former parent company of the Abiss Group. The total consideration paid for the Abiss Group was \u20ac80,000.\nAbiss is the legal manufacturer of several implantable surgical products, mainly for pelvic floor repair procedures. In addition, it is a subcontract manufacturer of similar products for other companies, including a shared customer of the RUA Group.\nBased on the provisional management accounts of Abiss (France), shareholders funds amounted to \u00a31 million which will result in other income of some \u00a3900k being recognised in the Interim Results of the Group. This bargain purchase gain is provisional and is expected to be revised once the fair value calculations have been finalised.\nShortly after the acquisition of the Abiss Group, it was subject to a rigorous FDA audit of its activities and systems and came through the audit process with no issues to report, which provides a strong confirmation of the quality of the team and systems employed at the Abiss Group.\nThe Board's short-term priorities with the Abiss Group are to ensure that the \u20ac1m order backlog caused by supply chain issues relating to packaging components (now resolved) is dispatched to customers over the next quarter. A business and strategy review is underway to seek to grow the Abiss business further and incorporate the Abiss Group into the overall strategy for the device manufacturing business unit of RUA.\nChange of accounting reference date\nThe Group\nannounces that it will be changing its accounting reference date and financial year end from 31 March to 30 September. Going forward, interim and annual accounts will be prepared and published for the six months ending 31 March and the twelve months ending 30 September, respectively.\nThe Company has changed its financi",

The acquisition will be funded from the Company's existing cash resources and will be paid in full on completion.\nFounded in 2000, Abiss is the legal manufacturer of a number of long term implantable devices as well as being a sub contract manufacturer of medical devices for third parties from its factory and clean room facilities in Saint Etienne, France where it has around 20 employees.\nIt is the stated objective of RUA to double the scale of its contract manufacturing business over the medium term. This opportunity, which aligns with this objective, arose when the Company was asked by a significant customer to assist in de-risking certain supply chain issues due to the insolvency of the parent company of Abiss, one of its suppliers.\nSince its creation, Abiss has promoted an innovative approach to surgical implants working closely with surgeons to develop the first sling for the treatment of female Stress Urinary Incontinence (\"SUI\") (trans obturator route) with this procedure becoming the \"gold standard\". Abiss owns the IP and has CE Mark approval for three products in the SUI field, Aris, Supris and Cyrene\u00a0which are marketed in Europe by distributors (including an Abiss 60% subsidiary in Poland). The Aris and Supris products are licensed to and manufactured for Coloplast who hold FDA approval for these products in the US. During the past three years, Abiss has successfully completed the compilation of data necessary to transition its products from the outgoing Medical Device Directive regulations to the new MDR system. Abiss has also developed a third-party contract manufacture business over the past two years. While the procedure and devices that Abiss supplies have historically been the subject of litigation and it has been a party to claims, all such claims have been settled and there are no potential claims notified or disclosed.\nThe gross assets of Abiss at 31 December 2023 were\u00a0\u20ac2,265,000. Revenue in the year to 31 December 2023 was\u00a0\u20ac2,159,000\u00a0up 36% from \u20ac1,592,000 during 2023. Loss before tax was\u00a0\u20ac352,000 after depreciation and amortisation charges of \u20ac537,000. In the year to 31 December 2023, Abiss had net positive cash flow of \u20ac223,000 and cash balances of \u20ac279,000 at the year end. Net Assets/Shareholders Funds at 31 December 2023 were \u20ac1,624,000. Non-current liabilities totalled \u20ac640,000 at 31 December 2023.\nAbiss was part of a wider medical devices group which went into insolvent liquidation in June 2021 because of Covid. Although the parent company was in liquidation, Abiss itself was not placed in receivership/liquidation. Abiss has continued to trade solvently and has traded within its own financial resources with the exception of French Government Covid support loans. The balance of these loans at 31 December 2023 was \u20ac293,000 (\u20ac418,000 in 2022) and these are being repaid over an agreed period. The nature of the transaction has precluded an extensive financial due diligence process and post-acquisition a detailed financial forecast for the Abiss business will be developed. Based on discussions with Coloplast, the board is confident that there is continuing commitment to the Abiss products and there should not be any negative impact on RUA profitability as a result of the acquisition.\nThis complementary acquisition is in line with RUA's strategy to grow and expand its Contract Manufacture business and leverages the Group's strong customer relationships and reputation for quality. It alone is expected to secure the Group's medium term growth targets and, together with the project announced on 24 July, which the group hopes to convert into a longer-term supply contract, positions the Group well to further accelerate this position. The acquisition price was set through an auction process with other interested parties not having RUA's unique position as a buyer with a strong relationship with a major customer.\nBill Brown, CEO of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences, stated\n: \"There are many similarities between Abiss and RUA Contract Manufacture, particularly with a shared customer. Abiss has been pursuing contract manufacture opportunities to further grow its business and the combined strengths of RUA and Abiss should only increase the potential. We very muc",

The Period benefited from a small part of the \u00a3400,000 project announced on 24 July 2024 and it is pleasing that this contract has now expanded to around \u00a3700,000 for the current financial year.\nCosts remain tightly controlled and were significantly down on budget for the Period and the Board expects this, together with increased revenues, to lead to a much-reduced loss in comparison to the first half of last year. The Company remains confident in achieving the market expectations for this financial year.\nAll the above-mentioned growth has been achieved within the Contract Manufacture business and growing the scale of this business remains of strategic importance. RUA is currently engaged in a number of potential developments which would add to growth in the short term.\nThe other two targets for the year: seeking a partner to finance the regulatory pathway for the vascular graft business and licensing AurTex\n\u2122\n, our heart valve leaflet composite, are both ongoing. As previously announced, the AurTex\n\u2122\nleaflet material has been tested by a potential partner and having concluded this initial stage further data is now being shared.

This was followed by the announcement of a successful equity issue and at the end of January with the departure of the Group Managing Director. It was stated at the time that consideration would be given to the appropriate longer term management structure and further announcements would be made in due course. Over recent months, it has become clear that a smaller, more agile executive team is allowing the business to focus on its three key objectives to achieve cash generation earlier, to grow and develop contract manufacture, to commercialise the heart valve leaflet material and to partner the remaining regulatory pathway for vascular grafts.\nManagement Structure\nAfter reviewing the management structure, it has been agreed that the role of Executive Chair will be replaced by the appointment of Geoff Berg, a current non-executive director as Non-Executive Chairman. Additionally, Bill Brown will assume a new role within RUA as Chief Executive working closely with Lachlan Smith who continues as Chief Financial Officer but assuming a wider role covering a number of additional operational areas\n.\nOver the past few years, in anticipation of concluding graft development in-house, a number of roles were created, and systems introduced to reflect the needs of a larger organisation. A process of streamlining the management structure has now concluded with the benefit of considerable cost savings together with much improved lines of communication.\nIssue of Share Options\nThe Company has granted options over 3,650,000 ordinary shares of \u00a30.05 to Directors and other members of staff under the Company's Share Option Plans. Following the issuance of these share options, the Company will have 5,625,603 shares under option being 9 % of the issued share capital of the Company.\nThe Options have been awarded as follows:\nName\nNumber of New Options Granted\nScheme\nWilliam Brown\n1,400,000\nEMI\nLachlan Smith\n1,200,000\nEMI\nJohn McKenna\n225,000\nEMI\nGeoff Berg\n225,000\nUnapproved\nJohn Ely\n150,000\nUnapproved\nIan Ardill\n150,000\nUnapproved\nOther Employees\n300,000\nEMI\nTOTAL\n3,650,000\nThe options have an exercise price of 11 pence per share, representing a premium to the closing mid-market price per ordinary share on the day preceding the grant of these options. The vesting terms of all options issued have been simplified to reflect the objective of incentivising management to grow shareholder value. All outstanding Options shall be exercisable on the expiry of the period of 3 years from the Date of Grant, with the usual acceleration of vesting in the event of a takeover prior to the final vesting date. Additionally, if a return of capital is proposed at an amount per share that is greater than the exercise price per share of these options, they will vest immediately prior to such return of capital to allow option holders to participate.\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, CEO\nLachlan Smith, CFO\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCavendish\u00a0Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGiles Balleny/Dan Hodkinson\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nCharlie Combe\u00a0(Broking)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nAbout\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\nThe\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Sciences Plc\u00a0(formerly known as\u00a0AorTech International Plc) acquired\u00a0RUA Medical Devices Limited\u00a0to create a fully formed medical device business.\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0is the holding company of the Group's four trading businesses, each exploiting the Group's patented polymer technology.\nOur vision is to improve the lives of millions of patients by enabling medical devices with Elast-Eon\nTM\n, the world's leading long-term implantable polyurethane.

As anticipated, the revenue shortfall experienced during H1 has been fully compensated by a strong H2 performance. As a result, the Company expects to report, subject to audit, FY24 revenue of \u00a32.2 million, which is in line with market expectations. The Company is pleased to announce that the recovery in revenues has not been at the cost of gross margins, and it is anticipated that reported margins will exceed expectations. The Group has focussed on cost control throughout the year. These rigorous measures are expected to result in operating costs of \u00a33.4 million, approximately \u00a30.2 million below market expectations for the year.\nCash Position\nStrong cost management, together with the anticipated recovery in trading during the second half, means the Company remains financially resilient, with a strong balance sheet and a cash position of approximately \u00a34.0m. Despite challenging trading conditions, these achievements underscore the Group's resilience and adeptness in financial and operational management.\nBusiness Development\nSignificant efforts have been focussed on business development activities as part of the Group's strategy to reach profitability in the short term. It has been the strategy to seek to grow the scale of contract manufacturing, and the Company is pleased to announce that it has succeeded in securing the initial development stages of a significant contract with a global enterprise. This contract represents a major milestone on the route to doubling revenues for the contract manufacturing division once fully operational. Initial development work under this contract has commenced, with an initial purchase order valued at \u00a3100,000 already received.\nAdditionally, as announced on 20 December 2023, the Company has successfully entered into a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) with a global Heart Valve company. The Group's composite material has been delivered and is currently being tested by this partner. The non-calcific nature of Elast-Eon, together with the tear resistance of the novel composite (up to two times improvement over current materials), positions RUA as a leader in developing next-generation alternative leaflet material resistant to Structural Valve Degeneration (SVD). The Company is confident that these results will be of significant interest to other prospective partners and is actively exploring additional potential partnerships.\nBill Brown, Chairman of RUA Life Sciences, stated\n:\n\"\nTrading results for FY24 represent a meaningful step in delivering on the Group's strategy outlined in November, and the efforts to focus the business on growth are showing promise.\"\nCommenting on the Contract Manufacturing success, Bill added:\n\"Securing this contract underscores RUA's expertise in implantable fabrics and moves us closer to profitability. It is our first major contract since the acquisition of RUA Medical Devices in 2020 and supports our belief that there are significant market opportunities in this area.\"\nBill further elaborated on the heart valve composite by stating:\n\"Our material has exceeded expectations, demonstrating remarkable durability and energy efficiency compared to market-leading valves. We are actively seeking partnerships to leverage these compelling results. RUA believes that these outstanding results in preclinical and bench studies are a result of the unique combination of RUA's expertise in medical fabrics and the biostability of Elast-Eon\"\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chairman\nLachlan Smith, CFO\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGiles Balleny/Dan Hodkinson (Corporate Finance)\nCharlie Combe (Broking)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nAbout RUA Life Sciences\nThe RUA Life Sciences group was created in April 2020 when RUA Life Sciences Plc (formerly known as AorTech International Plc) acquired RUA Medical Devices Limited to create a fully formed medical device business.

The computational modelling of the composite material at the design stage suggested that its mechanical properties would be ideal for heart valve leaflets.\nTesting undertaken by RUA has demonstrated:\n\u00b7\nFlex fatigue stability over 400m cycles\n\u00b7\nDurability as a heart valve leaflet over 200m cycles\n\u00b7\nRemarkable tensile strength properties exceeding both base fabric and polymer\n\u00b7\nSimilar tensile strength in multiple directions\n\u00b7\nHighly flexible allowing improved valve efficiency.\n\u00b7\nNarrow crimping profile allowing TAVR benefits\n\u00b7\nRetention of ElastEon blood contacting properties such as calcification and thrombogenicity.\n\u00b7\nMaterial very stable with no delamination during testing and high tear resistance.\nPatent protection for the material has now been sought and coupled with the testing results achieved RUA is now seeking to commercialise the RUA composite material as an alternative to animal tissue used in the manufacture of heart valves. Engagement with the industry has been positive and, as previously announced, a major heart valve company has approached the Company to undertake its own tests and has now entered into a material testing agreement (MTA) in order to do so.\nWhile there can be no certainty that the parties will progress to an agreement, an MTA is the preliminary step to further collaboration.\nBill Brown, Chairman of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences,\u00a0stated\n:\n\"Combining RUA's expertise in implantable textile materials with the clinically proven properties of ElastEon has created a novel material that appears to meet the key properties required of heart valve leaflets and it is pleasing that the business is now transitioning from a R&D phase into early stages of commercialisation.\"\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chairman\nCaroline Stretton, Group Managing Director\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nTel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCavendish\u00a0Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGiles Balleny/Dan Hodkinson\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nCharlie Combe\u00a0(Broking)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nAbout\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\nThe\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Sciences Plc\u00a0(formerly known as\u00a0AorTech International Plc) acquired\u00a0RUA Medical Devices Limited\u00a0to create a fully formed medical device business.\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0is the holding company of the Group's four trading businesses, each exploiting the Group's patented polymer technology.\nOur vision is to improve the lives of millions of patients by enabling medical devices with Elast-Eon\nTM\n, the world's leading long-term implantable polyurethane.

The composite material retains the blood contacting properties of Elast-Eon but is significantly stronger. This creates the opportunity for RUA Structural Heart to become a supplier of heart valve leaflets to other companies to incorporate in current designs.\nBill Brown, Chairman of the Company, commented:\n\"\nRUA has a portfolio of four businesses, all of which have made good progress during the period. The mature businesses are growing revenue and generating attractive net margins and the development business segments of Vascular and Structural Heart have made good regula",

The focus of the period was ensuring the Group was best positioned to undertake a capital raise to fund the commercialisation of the development divisions of the business. Much of the funding options available to the Group relied upon ensuring VCT and EIS qualification for potential investors. As a result of changes in VCT/EIS rules, the Group underwent a reorganisation to transfer the heart valve and vascular assets into the respective subsidiary companies. This reorganisation allowed advance assurance to be received and ultimately in the Company announcing the placing and retail offer which conditionally raised \u00a34.4 million.\nUnaudited interim results for the six months to 30 September 2023\nThe results below are the consolidated figures for the entire group and are further analyse",

The current year has seen this weighting reverse due to a temporary disruption in the timings of shipping orders to customers. As a result, total Group revenue (including royalties) for the period decreased to \u00a3794k, representing a year-on-year decline of 28% (\nH1 2023\n: \u00a31,104k).\n\u00b7\nBiomaterials royalties for the period from Elast-Eon increased to \u00a3199k, representing year on year growth of 6% (\nH1 2023\n: \u00a3187k)\n\u00b7\nContract Manufacture revenues for the period decreased to \u00a3595k, representing a year on year decline of 35% (\nH1 2023\n: \u00a3917k)\nNotably, however, post period end, October was a strong month for Contract Manufacture and by the month end, revenues had recovered to be just 6% behind budget for the year to date, and Management anticipates full order fulfilment by the end of November with trading in line with budget and subsequently back to normal trading volumes. Consequently, the Group is confident that full-year revenues will align with management expectations for the current financial year.\nCash\nDespite the order disruption, the Group continued to manage its resources tightly with cash at 30 September 2023 of \u00a30.5m (31 March 2023: \u00a31.5m). With a catch-up in order shipments together with the receipt of R&D Tax Credits of \u00a3381k, the cash position at 21 November 2023 stood at over \u00a31.0m.\nLoss for period\nAs a result of the heavy second-half weighting and the resulting shortfall in revenues, Group losses before tax for the period are expected to temporarily widen by 22% to \u00a31.4m (\nH1 2023\n: \u00a31.1m), reflecting the shortfall in revenues however, costs remained tightly controlled.\nBill Brown, Chairman of\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\n,\nstated\n:\n\"\nTaking into account the recent catch-up in shipments, o\nur Biomaterials and Contract Manufacturing businesses continue to perform in line with expectations and demonstrate growth potential.

The business unit is progressing just such an opportunity at present but more importantly has recently responded to a formal Bid Request for a product range directly within RUA's implantable textiles sweet spot that has annual revenue potential of around \u00a31.5 million. Another customer is expected to submit a bid request in the next few months at a value of around \u00a3500k. The progression of sales discussions into formal bid processes gives the board confidence that the Company is on track to meet its objective of doubling the scale of the Contract Manufacture business in the medium term.\nRUA Structural Heart\nStructural Heart is exceeding management's expectations with regards to the development and testing of the Company's novel composite material for the creation of heart valve leaflets. The composite which benefits from Elast-Eon's biostability and blood contacting properties is designed to improve the durability of flexible leaflet heart valves. Recent testing results have surpassed key milestones.\n\u00b7\nflex fatigue testing for durability passed 400 million cycles equivalent to 10 years in man.\n\u00b7\na heart valve made of the composite has achieved the key 200 million cycles required by ISO standards for a flexible leaflet heart valve.\n\u00b7\nhydrodynamic testing demonstrated valve efficiency around 50% better than current technology.\n\u00b7\nvalve flow area is around 25% larger than similar sized valves in the market.\n\u00b7\nRecent patent filing to protect the new IP entitled\n\"\nComposite Material, Heart Valve and Method of Manufacture\".\nRather than incur the full cost of developing a valve directly, our strategic focus is now to accelerate the commercial potential of RUA Structural Heart by making the composite available to the heart valve industry for incorporation into next generation valves. The Company expects to shortly formalise an agreement to provide composite material to a large heart valve company for its own testing and now that an attractive data pack is available on the composite, RUA intends to broaden this further through the industry..\nRUA Vascular\nRUA Vascular has now reached the stage of being fully prepared to commence the regulatory testing regime agreed with the FDA through the pre-sub process to achieve 510k approval. In summary,\n\u00b7\na product has been developed on which in vivo data has been gathered along with in vitro mechanical testing.\n\u00b7\nan automated manufacturing process established, and a pilot manufacturing plant set up.\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing process has attractive cost of goods analysis, is highly scalable and allows for positive gross margin potential.\n\u00b7\nthe products have already developed OEM customer interest with the first commercial sale recently achieved.\n\u00b7\na global distribution partnership has also been put in place to allow a simplified route to market.\nThe outstanding workstreams relate in the main to a GLP animal study to gather two additional intermediate time points as well as the six-month data collected in the original study, together with a relatively small clinical study of up to 120 patients with the performance goal set at six month follow up.\nDepending upon time of starting recruitment for the clinical studies and speed of recruitment, a timeframe to regulatory approval of between 30 and 36 months and a budget of approximately \u00a36 million is expected.\nHowever, given the current cost of capital and funding of the business, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders to not seek to fund these trials itself but explore other options for third party funding in the near term.\nWe believe that the Vascular project has very attractive risk adjusted returns on the additional investment required to achieve regulatory approval. The limiting factor however is the cost of capital placed upon RUA because of the depressed share price. Not only would dilution relate to the interest in the Vascular project but the substantial upside potential from both RUA Contract Manufacture and RUA Structural Heart would be limited for current shareholders. The investment in RUA Vascular will be exploited by seeking third party funding whilst retaining an interest in the project.\nThe change i",

We have continued to manage expenditure prudently and all main cost lines are showing positive variances to budget with overall costs 20% down on management's expectations. As a result of the tight control over expenditure and the positive trading, cash resources are also ahead of management's budget.\nThere have continued to be positive developments in all parts of the business which are summarised below:\nRUA Contract Manufacture\nhas made good progress with a customer funded development project for an implantable textile component of a currently marketed product. Assuming the project is a success, it is anticipated it will convert into a long term supply agreement. At a customer's request, we have also now supplied samples of textiles and components for another range of devices that are part of the customer's plans to de-risk supply chain issues by dual sourcing. Dual sourcing is a developing industry theme, a reaction to shocks to global supply chains during Covid, resulting in device manufacturers now being prepared to undertake the expense of validating second suppliers. We have had enquiries from other potential customers for textile devices, strengthening our belief of being able to double the scale of the business over the coming years.\nRevenues at\nRUA\nBiomaterials\nhave been in line with expectations with some positive indicators of shipments by Biomerics to new customers within the mix. Additionally, we have agreed an extension to one of our existing licenses that over time will allow a doubling of the royalty potential from licensee.\nRUA Structural Heart,\nwhich has been undertaking research and development activities into the creation of a polymeric heart valve, has made an outstanding breakthrough in the development of a synthetic leaflet material for the manufacture of heart valves. As well as demonstrating that it has the flexibility to perform as a heart valve leaflet, our new composite material has now achieved the important milestone of completing 400 million cycles (equivalent to 10 years in man and twice regulatory requirements) of fatigue testing. As at the time of the release of the Group's annual report, only 200 million cycles had been completed. The blood contacting properties of Elast-Eon, combined with the flexibility, durability and mechanical properties of the composite, mean that the new composite may well be suitable to be used in valve designs that are currently in the market. As such, the route to commercialisation for the RUA composite is no longer dependant on developing and testing our own valve design but could be more near term by making the composite available to other manufacturers. Having been approached, we have recently agreed to provide a major player with material for evaluation to initially confirm some of our in-house test results.\nRUA Vascular\n, the business developing the vascular graft range is now in the final stages of planning the pre-clinical and clinical trials that have been agreed with the FDA under the pre submission process. Quotations have been received and budgets prepared with detailed timelines as well as other detailed planning to allow testing to be undertaken as soon as funding allows. On commercial activities, we have always expected the grafts to be ideal for incorporation as components into other medical devices. We are delighted that our promotional efforts are being effective and we have now received a purchase order from a major company in the sector for grafts to trial as part of their devices. Although early stages, this first commercial sale of our graft devices is the beginnings of an OEM business line.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the\u00a0UK\u00a0version of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (2014/596) which is part of\u00a0UK\u00a0law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time.\nFor further information contact:\nRUA Life Sciences\nBill Brown, Chairman Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nDr\u00a0Caroline Stretton, Group MD Tel: +44 (0)1294 317073\nCenkos Securities\u00a0plc\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny/Max Gould\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson\u00a0(Sales)\nAbout\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\nThe\u00a0RUA Life Sciences\u00a0group was created in\u00a0April 2020\u00a0when\u00a0RUA Life Scien",

Despite this investment in people during the development stages of the Group, it is pleasing that Group loss before tax reduced marginally from \u00a32,360k to \u00a32,322k. At the post tax level, the reduction in loss was greater as R&D tax credits increased.\nCash was tightly controlled with total cash burn of \u00a31,479k resulting in a halving of cash balances from \u00a32,963k to \u00a31,484k.\nOur Portfolio\nThe RUA Group has a portfolio of four medical device businesses and during the year, we changed the basis of reporting on these businesses as part of a review of segmental reporting and analysis. The four businesses are Biomaterials, Contract Manufacture, Vascular and Structural Heart. The Group Managing Director's Report provides detailed analysis on each of the businesses, but I am pleased to set out below the key valuation metrics and opportunities for the constituent parts.\nRUA Biomaterials is the owner of our biostable polymer technology being exploited through a licensing model.

The introduction of segmental reporting has highlighted the benefits in financial control of separating the business units out from the parent's activities. The time is now right to formalise the process which is anticipated to bring further benefits including simplifying regulatory transparency and increasing funding options for the Group.\nThe hive downs have included the transfer of all related tangible and intangible assets (including intellectual property) of the parent Company to each of RUA Vascular Limited and RUA Structural Heart Limited. In addition, RUA Life Sciences plc will recover the costs attributable to each of the vascular graft and heart valve projects since 2018. Total attributed cost recovery for RUA Vascular is \u00a34.4 million and RUA Structural Heart is \u00a33.1 million, which will remain as an intercompany debt. This will result in RUA Life Sciences plc booking a one off trading profit of some \u00a37.5 million. This trading profit will appear in RUA Life Sciences's individual company accounts but be eliminated on consolidation of the group.\nBill Brown, Chairman of the Company, commented:\n\"\nThis transaction is an important step in RUA's journey of exploiting the clinical and commercial value of ElastEon. Two businesses have been incubated within RUA each of which is building upon the platform technology.

Segmental reporting of the Group is now focussed on the underlying business units and it is pleasing to report underlying net profit margins (before amortisation and taxation) of 55% for Contract Manufacture and 89% for Biomaterials. Unaudited R&D expenditure of the Group is expected to be \u00a31,070,000 (2022: \u00a3887,000), an increase of \u00a3183,000 over the preceding year, demonstrating continued investment in this area.\nOverall, loss before tax for the period is expected to be similar to last year at around \u00a32.3 to 2.4 million.\nCash resources have been prudently managed, and the balance sheet is expected to show a cash balance at the period end of \u00a31,484,000 (2022: \u00a32,963,000) with the cash burn reduced by the receipt of R&D Tax Credit payments which are accounted for on a cash basis.\nThe\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM)\nis planned for Tuesday 22 August 2023. A further notice of meeting announcement will be made in due course.\nBusiness Segments\nThe two core technologies of the RUA group are implantable textile expertise and the Intellectual Property within the ElastEon family of biomaterials. The business is managed on a portfolio basis with four operating segments each of which is exploiting one or both core technologies.\nRUA Biomaterials\nRUA Biomaterials continues to enjoy steady growth with unaudited revenues increasing 14% to \u00a3554,000. Revenues are derived from royalty and license fees associated with the Elast-Eon technology. Direct costs within this business are minimal and the business segment enjoyed high net margins of 89%. RUA considers the cash flows from the business segment as a \"growing perpetuity\" which at a discount rate of 12% and growth of rate 5% would value this business segment at around \u00a37 million.\nRUA Contract Manufacture\nThis business segment represents the third-party contract manufacturing activities acquired with RUA Medical in 2020\n. This business has enjoyed very good growth during the year with unaudited revenue increasing\n43% to \u00a31,625,000. Net profit margins of 55% are generated within the business unit and it continues to meet and exceed customer expectations for quality, efficiency and value for money. New and existing customers are actively reviewing projects with RUA that could double the current scale of the business over a two-year period. For review and investment purposes, management value this business on an EBITDA multiple having observed the very attractive multiples that medical device contract manufacture commands.\nRUA Vascular\nAs previously reported, RUA has been undertaking a \"pre-sub\" with the FDA and RUA is delighted to report that agreement has very recently been reached with the FDA on protocols for a GLP animal trial and a human clinical trial of the RUA vascular graft. This has been a lengthy process but felt to be worthwhile as it limits the risk of the FDA asking for additional information or testing after submission. During this period of discussion with the FDA, RUA has taken the opportunity to undertake additional development and testing on the graft range with a view to improving performance and maximising manufacturing yields. A detailed work plan has been prepared for the agreed testing regime and quotations received from third party test houses for the required work. The clinical study will involve around 120 patients and further details regarding the costings and timings of this work will be announced in due course.\nThe other major development in the period was signing the distribution agreement with Corcym allowing direct hospital sales to be made on regulatory approval.\nRUA Structural Heart\nThe objectives for RUA Structural Heart for the period was to evaluate heart valve leaflet material and compare the performance of 100% polymeric valves with a novel composite developed by the Group.

          "content": "One of the problems here is that the value in contract manufacturing is submerged in the costs of research and development so the bottom line always looks anaemic. Last year has seen a marked reduction of group losses but, within that, is a solid CM business, surrounded by a possible gold mine of highly developed R&D. Turnover of \u00a35M+ and gross margins in the 75-80% range in CM should be commanding a valuation by itself of \u00a320M or more. If a bigger business were to buy out that part of the group, they could make big savings if they already have a similar business and are buying in a strong profit centre with top rate customers. As it is, this value is subsumed and thus we have our entire group valued at \u00a38M. That includes, apart from the \u00a320M CM division, an embedded pool of IP which includes a potential advance in materials for heart valves (a future need in an industry that uses legacy technology that could be endangered by animal disease in the cow herds it relies on). Merry Christmas to all who sail in this ship! In a bullish market scenario, this story would turbo charge the share price. As it is, we are at maximum sentiment negativity levels.",

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

If the result of the NDA revealed barriers to commercialisation, should we have been informed by now? Will RUA release a second RNS pre or post final results with an update. They are fortunate to have such dedicated and patient investors.",

The price has held surprisingly well in the 10p-14p range but fails to breakout of it. The imminent final results for 18 months to 39/9/25 OUGHT to be used to provide detailed information to shareholders of the state of play of the business divisions and perhaps a realistic indication of expectations. This is the time to do it especially as the board declared that they will not produce a running commentary about how negotiations on each area of development and commerce are progressing. Shareholders have a right to some transparency at the time of the final results.",

Once they have a contract, it tends to be long term and profitable as medtech devices cannot just be switched around in a supply chain. Looking at these numbers, the last 6 months has seen \u00a31.3M revenue added to the UK contract manufacturing (was \u00a32.2M for the previous 12 months, so growth continued). Abiss, as flagged last time due to customer destocking, had a reduced rate of turnover, \u00a3900k compared to \u00a31,300k in the 7 month period to 31/3/25 since acquisition at start of Sep 24. The legacy royalty business was steady as usual with a rate of around \u00a3300k every 6 months. For me this is overall steady and stable, awaiting new business contracts to be sealed and delivered. I don\u2019t expect fireworks in the share price. We need new contracts to be sealed for that to happen but the consolation is that cash is still well managed.",

Revenues from Abiss, acquired in September 2024 were \u00a32.2m in the 12-months to September 2025. \u2014 Profitability: For the 12-months to March 2025, RUA expects to report adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5m, including the \u00a30.9m gain on the Abiss acquisition. Excluding this, the company would report a loss of c\u00a30.4m compared to a \u00a31.6m loss for the equivalent 12-months to March 2024. We believe this result demonstrates substantial progress towards delivering sustainable profitability. The company expects to remain profitable for the full 18-month period to September 2025. \u2014 Cash: RUA previously reported cash of \u00a33.8m at the close of September 2024. With reduced utilisation, cash at the end of March 2025 was \u00a33.5m, with the company expecting to report closing cash for September 2025 of \u00a33.2m, with much of this reduction in cash balance relating to increased working capital to support the growth of the business. \u2014 Investment thesis: We believe this trading update demonstrates the strong progress RUA is delivering against its strategy that looks to generate near-term profitability by focusing on the company\u2019s revenue generating divisions. We believe the progress indicates RUA is now a significantly de-risked, revenue generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. We believe the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\"",

          "content": "A new research note is out today from Hybridan. The most relevant excerpts for me are: \"Medical device manufacturing is relatively complex and is driven by strict regulatory considerations. This  barrier  to  entry  is  compensated for  by attractive margins  and long-term supply contracts reflecting the long medical product life cycles. There are two FDA registered facilities and four clean rooms in Ayrshire, Scotland. RUA is an expert in the development and introduction of processes that validate demonstrable quality control methodologies. ABISS is being integrated to provide additional sub and contract manufacturing. There is a growing pipeline of medical device customers going through  regulatory  approval  which  could  lead  to  multi-year,  multi-million-pound contracts.\" \"RUA owns the  IP to Elast-Eon which  is  a  clinically  proven  polymer technology  and accepted as the most biostable of all implant suitable polyurethane materials. The IP is licensed to  medical companies for  royalty payments  and  is  also  used  by RUA  in manufacturing.  The material is used in long term implantation of a  growing  list of devices, such as stents, catheters and pacemakers etc. Elast-Eon is enabling the next generation  of  cardiovascular  medical  devices;  the  market  is  projected  to  grow  to $115bn by 2030 from \u00a360bn in 2024. There are currently Biomaterial development projects opportunities underway. One such combines textiles expertise with Elast-Eon to create a novel heart valve leaflet material. These innovative CDMO contracts take time to move to revenue, and RUA considers it is counter-productive to provide the market with guidance on the progress of contract negotiations.\" We are told in the MIFID-inspired footnotes that these notes should not be treated as independent research but as marketing tools. That's fine then as it implies the company has had an input into the contents. There are a few juicy hints in those paragraphs so I hope some of these projects reach the signing stage!",

Not sure how they've come up with two such different figures. I hadn't fully taken in RUA RNS, but having read it all the way through I was encouraged by the following: In the final six months of the reporting period, customer concentration was reduced with 54% from the largest customer, 33% from the new supply contract announced in January this year and 13% from business development activity that if projects are successful could drive the revenue growth of the future. 13% of revenue from business development activity is a useful stat (I hope they keep that one up) and adds further credibility to their claims of an exciting pipeline of business. 13% also seems like a big chuck of money even for the relatively small pie.",

In this initiation report we review the group\u2019s attractive investment thesis and conclude the 40% sell-off in the past 12 months significantly undervalues the group\u2019s potential. We initiate coverage with a 110p Fair Value equating to 1.1x EV / Revenues, c.11x EV/EBITDA and a c.5% FCF yield (cal 2026). Victorian Plumbing has navigated major changes, completing a \u00a321m warehouse, acquiring Victoria Plum for \u00a322.5m, and launching into homewares. FY25 revenues rose 5% to \u00a3310m with market share up to 21.5%, while adjusted PBT grew 5% to \u00a324.3m despite cost pressures. The MFI relaunch shows promise with strong reviews and controlled start-up costs, supported by disciplined investment and robust cash flows. We value the bathrooms business on 9x cal 2026 EV/EBITDA (implying over \u00a3330m EV, c.1x Revenues, nearly 100p per share) with the potential for the homewares business to be worth c.\u00a345m (3x cal 2028 EV / Revenues), adding another c.15p per share. Hence, we see scope for a significant re-rating as confidence builds in management\u2019s strategy.",

Last year has seen a marked reduction of group losses but, within that, is a solid CM business, surrounded by a possible gold mine of highly developed R&D. Turnover of \u00a35M+ and gross margins in the 75-80% range in CM should be commanding a valuation by itself of \u00a320M or more. If a bigger business were to buy out that part of the group, they could make big savings if they already have a similar business and are buying in a strong profit centre with top rate customers. As it is, this value is subsumed and thus we have our entire group valued at \u00a38M. That includes, apart from the \u00a320M CM division, an embedded pool of IP which includes a potential advance in materials for heart valves (a future need in an industry that uses legacy technology that could be endangered by animal disease in the cow herds it relies on). Merry Christmas to all who sail in this ship! In a bullish market scenario, this story would turbo charge the share price. As it is, we are at maximum sentiment negativity levels.",

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

The imminent final results for 18 months to 39/9/25 OUGHT to be used to provide detailed information to shareholders of the state of play of the business divisions and perhaps a realistic indication of expectations. This is the time to do it especially as the board declared that they will not produce a running commentary about how negotiations on each area of development and commerce are progressing. Shareholders have a right to some transparency at the time of the final results.",

Following contract wins since the start of FY2026 of over \u00a360m, the order book on 20 September 2025 stood at over \u00a3590m, giving revenue cover of consensus FY26 estimated revenue of nearly 90%. Q1 saw a strong contribution from EM Solutions that was offset by reduced activity at MCL, the latter having enjoyed notably strong levels last year. There was also a weaker mix at both ELAC and SEA (which includes the sale of the latter\u2019s transport business in May 2025). The combination of planned capital expenditure, including the completion of ELAC SONAR\u2019s new facility in Kiel and the unwinding of the strong year-end working capital position, primarily customer advances, indicates net debt of c. \u00a330m at the half year. Yet the Group expects to close FY2026 with net funds \u201cin the range of \u00a310m to \u00a315m as previously reported\u201d. Cohort also reported that: \"Geopolitical tensions are driving increased investment in defence\" and that it remains \"optimistic for prospects for further significant new orders.\" We maintain our fair value at 1,930p/share.",

There are (or were) probably a combined 10% of RUA posting on this thread in the recent year or two. Yet, so many of them seem to have ceased posting here so it is likely that some of them are in the net 2M of sales mentioned.

I do not have high expectations for revenue or announcements, but that in itself is not the investment case. What we are most hoping for is a major partnership on the heart valve or a major CM contract (minor ones welcome). The latest RNS allude to 'negotiations' and their behaviour (silence) is typical of such activity. Without jumping back to reports I recall Rua make 4M revenue, are close to break even, are valued at 6M and have IP on genuinely useful tech. They are a credible CM business with working relationships with major players. Not only is there a recovery / re-rate case for the SP, but also a growth play.  If they were valued at just 10x revenue the MCap would be 40M or 60p per share. But don't ask for timescales! all you will get is 'industry moves slowly' (which is sadly correct).",

Once they have a contract, it tends to be long term and profitable as medtech devices cannot just be switched around in a supply chain. Looking at these numbers, the last 6 months has seen \u00a31.3M revenue added to the UK contract manufacturing (was \u00a32.2M for the previous 12 months, so growth continued). Abiss, as flagged last time due to customer destocking, had a reduced rate of turnover, \u00a3900k compared to \u00a31,300k in the 7 month period to 31/3/25 since acquisition at start of Sep 24. The legacy royalty business was steady as usual with a rate of around \u00a3300k every 6 months. For me this is overall steady and stable, awaiting new business contracts to be sealed and delivered. I don\u2019t expect fireworks in the share price. We need new contracts to be sealed for that to happen but the consolation is that cash is still well managed.",

          "content": "Cavendish have reiterated their 50p target price, and summarise as follows: Extracts: \"Strong revenue performance \u2014 Revenue: RUA revenues are expected to be c\u00a30.4m ahead of our forecasts. Revenues for the18months to September 2025 are expected to be \u00a36.6m, c6% ahead of our estimated \u00a36.2m, while for the 12-months to September 2025, revenues are expected to be \u00a35.1m versus our \u00a34.7m forecast (c9% ahead). The company notes substantial efforts have been made to diversify its contract manufacturing customer base, such that over the 6-months to September 2025, the largest customer represented 54% of revenues versus c95% historically. \u2014 Drivers: Revenue growth was delivered across the business. Biomaterials revenues were \u00a30.9m for the 18-month period (\u00a30.5m for 12-months to March 2024) and Contract Manufacturing revenues were \u00a33.5m versus \u00a31.7m for the 12-months to March 2024. Revenues from Abiss, acquired in September 2024 were \u00a32.2m in the 12-months to September 2025. \u2014 Profitability: For the 12-months to March 2025, RUA expects to report adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5m, including the \u00a30.9m gain on the Abiss acquisition. Excluding this, the company would report a loss of c\u00a30.4m compared to a \u00a31.6m loss for the equivalent 12-months to March 2024. We believe this result demonstrates substantial progress towards delivering sustainable profitability. The company expects to remain profitable for the full 18-month period to September 2025. \u2014 Cash: RUA previously reported cash of \u00a33.8m at the close of September 2024. With reduced utilisation, cash at the end of March 2025 was \u00a33.5m, with the company expecting to report closing cash for September 2025 of \u00a33.2m, with much of this reduction in cash balance relating to increased working capital to support the growth of the business. \u2014 Investment thesis: We believe this trading update demonstrates the strong progress RUA is delivering against its strategy that looks to generate near-term profitability by focusing on the company\u2019s revenue generating divisions. We believe the progress indicates RUA is now a significantly de-risked, revenue generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. We believe the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\"",

          "content": "A new research note is out today from Hybridan. The most relevant excerpts for me are: \"Medical device manufacturing is relatively complex and is driven by strict regulatory considerations. This  barrier  to  entry  is  compensated for  by attractive margins  and long-term supply contracts reflecting the long medical product life cycles. There are two FDA registered facilities and four clean rooms in Ayrshire, Scotland. RUA is an expert in the development and introduction of processes that validate demonstrable quality control methodologies. ABISS is being integrated to provide additional sub and contract manufacturing. There is a growing pipeline of medical device customers going through  regulatory  approval  which  could  lead  to  multi-year,  multi-million-pound contracts.\" \"RUA owns the  IP to Elast-Eon which  is  a  clinically  proven  polymer technology  and accepted as the most biostable of all implant suitable polyurethane materials. The IP is licensed to  medical companies for  royalty payments  and  is  also  used  by RUA  in manufacturing.  The material is used in long term implantation of a  growing  list of devices, such as stents, catheters and pacemakers etc. Elast-Eon is enabling the next generation  of  cardiovascular  medical  devices;  the  market  is  projected  to  grow  to $115bn by 2030 from \u00a360bn in 2024. There are currently Biomaterial development projects opportunities underway. One such combines textiles expertise with Elast-Eon to create a novel heart valve leaflet material. These innovative CDMO contracts take time to move to revenue, and RUA considers it is counter-productive to provide the market with guidance on the progress of contract negotiations.\" We are told in the MIFID-inspired footnotes that these notes should not be treated as independent research but as marketing tools. That's fine then as it implies the company has had an input into the contents. There are a few juicy hints in those paragraphs so I hope some of these projects reach the signing stage!",

Not sure how they've come up with two such different figures. I hadn't fully taken in RUA RNS, but having read it all the way through I was encouraged by the following: In the final six months of the reporting period, customer concentration was reduced with 54% from the largest customer, 33% from the new supply contract announced in January this year and 13% from business development activity that if projects are successful could drive the revenue growth of the future. 13% of revenue from business development activity is a useful stat (I hope they keep that one up) and adds further credibility to their claims of an exciting pipeline of business. 13% also seems like a big chuck of money even for the relatively small pie.",

In this initiation report we review the group\u2019s attractive investment thesis and conclude the 40% sell-off in the past 12 months significantly undervalues the group\u2019s potential. We initiate coverage with a 110p Fair Value equating to 1.1x EV / Revenues, c.11x EV/EBITDA and a c.5% FCF yield (cal 2026). Victorian Plumbing has navigated major changes, completing a \u00a321m warehouse, acquiring Victoria Plum for \u00a322.5m, and launching into homewares. FY25 revenues rose 5% to \u00a3310m with market share up to 21.5%, while adjusted PBT grew 5% to \u00a324.3m despite cost pressures. The MFI relaunch shows promise with strong reviews and controlled start-up costs, supported by disciplined investment and robust cash flows. We value the bathrooms business on 9x cal 2026 EV/EBITDA (implying over \u00a3330m EV, c.1x Revenues, nearly 100p per share) with the potential for the homewares business to be worth c.\u00a345m (3x cal 2028 EV / Revenues), adding another c.15p per share. Hence, we see scope for a significant re-rating as confidence builds in management\u2019s strategy.",

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

If the result of the NDA revealed barriers to commercialisation, should we have been informed by now? Will RUA release a second RNS pre or post final results with an update.

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

The longer reporting period results from the Company's decision to change its year-end from March to September, providing additional time to integrate the Abiss acquisition and to align our reporting cycle with that of a major customer to support improved planning. The financial results for the period to 30 September 2025 are presented below together with the strategic and organisational progress achieved by the Company. Throughout the Report and Accounts, reported revenues and expense items relate to an 18-month period, whilst prior period comparatives are for the 12 months to 31 March 2024.\nBackground\nI concluded my statement last year by observing that RUA had recently switched from a business with funding required to finance the needs of R&D projects to a financially strong business focussed on growth, cash generation and profitability. It is against this background that we set out this report.\nTrading for Year\nThe headline trading results demonstrate that RUA has made exceptional progress towards its objectives of growth and profitability. Revenue grew over threefold from \u00a32.19 million in the year to March 2024 to \u00a36.69 million in the 18 month period to September 2025. L",

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

I notice the wording regarding the valve is 'serious interest' which means nothing on it's own but coupled with the 'off book' comment it becomes interesting (a hint at a partnership).  Is this just designed to lead me down a road or is that as much as they can say. The information on medical devices division is interesting, for me this is still the most important area to develop and they have provided far more information on timescales than before, this suggests to me some early stage prospects are reaching significant milestones but are still likely to be years off. I hope there are some projects in the pipeline that don't require years of R&D and maybe even another Abiss to put the cash to good use. The share still looks dirt cheap to me but I think you need a medium term view on it. I can see drip selling until news drops.",

If anyone fancies trying to join the dots, it's interesting to note the following news from 27 January 2026 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/resonetics-to-acquire-resolution-medical-expanding-capabilities-in-neuromodulation-and-structural-heart-markets-302671594.html I'm still fascinated by the \"off-book\" comment in RUA RNS 30th January 2026 If AurTex is the \"secret sauce\" (material) then perhaps Resonetics/Resolution Medical is the \"factory and kitchen\" that could bring it to the global market.",

          "content": "The round sum selling today and in recent weeks got me thinking. One holding that has always puzzled me was the rump of about 775k shares held by Amati VCT. They were originally the cornerstone investor in the 2020 equity raise at 120p buying around 1.7m shares (8% at the time) but started selling out after the setback FDA ruling a year later but they held onto the rump according to their holdings disclosures. I looked up Amati and found that Amati VCT had become Maven Renovar VCT. The following two extracts from the Maven website shows they are selling a lot of their AIM portfolio. From Maven website and fact sheet: \u201cThe investment objective of Maven Renovar VCT PLC (formerly Amati AIM VCT plc)\u00a0is to generate tax free capital gains and income on investors' funds, through investment primarily in AIM-traded companies.\u201d \u201cOUTLOOK The Board have declared interim and special dividends totalling 5.00p per Share, paid in November from the VCT\u2019s existing liquidity. As previously outlined in the 2025 Interim Report, the Manager intends to make further sales from the AIM portfolio and it is anticipated that the proceeds will be distributed to Shareholders through further dividends and potentially a tender offer on which the Board intends to consult Shareholders. We believe this strategy will protect value, return investors\u2019 capital efficiently, and offers an exit for Shareholders seeking to realise their investment in full.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, someone has been selling round amounts of RUA into the recent strength for quite a while so it would make sense that these guys are partly responsible. It\u2019s possible but not proved!",

I am less expectant of a superb valve partnership / contract then prior to today's release, I think that is further down the line. The market cap is ludicrously and unjustifiably low in my opinion, making it safe from falls and benefiting from huge potential upsides. This should be 30-50p now.",

I am less expectant of a superb valve partnership / contract then prior to today's release, I think that is further down the line. The market cap is ludicrously and unjustifiably low in my opinion, making it safe from falls and benefiting from huge potential upsides. This should be 30-50p now.",

So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in.

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

Now the final accounts have been reported I hope RUA have something to say soon, at the least about H1 when the period ends. I notice the wording regarding the valve is 'serious interest' which means nothing on it's own but coupled with the 'off book' comment it becomes interesting (a hint at a partnership).  Is this just designed to lead me down a road or is that as much as they can say. The information on medical devices division is interesting, for me this is still the most important area to develop and they have provided far more information on timescales than before, this suggests to me some early stage prospects are reaching significant milestones but are still likely to be years off. I hope there are some projects in the pipeline that don't require years of R&D and maybe even another Abiss to put the cash to good use. The share still looks dirt cheap to me but I think you need a medium term view on it. I can see drip selling until news drops.",

They were originally the cornerstone investor in the 2020 equity raise at 120p buying around 1.7m shares (8% at the time) but started selling out after the setback FDA ruling a year later but they held onto the rump according to their holdings disclosures. I looked up Amati and found that Amati VCT had become Maven Renovar VCT. The following two extracts from the Maven website shows they are selling a lot of their AIM portfolio. From Maven website and fact sheet: \u201cThe investment objective of Maven Renovar VCT PLC (formerly Amati AIM VCT plc)\u00a0is to generate tax free capital gains and income on investors' funds, through investment primarily in AIM-traded companies.\u201d \u201cOUTLOOK The Board have declared interim and special dividends totalling 5.00p per Share, paid in November from the VCT\u2019s existing liquidity. As previously outlined in the 2025 Interim Report, the Manager intends to make further sales from the AIM portfolio and it is anticipated that the proceeds will be distributed to Shareholders through further dividends and potentially a tender offer on which the Board intends to consult Shareholders. We believe this strategy will protect value, return investors\u2019 capital efficiently, and offers an exit for Shareholders seeking to realise their investment in full.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, someone has been selling round amounts of RUA into the recent strength for quite a while so it would make sense that these guys are partly responsible.

I am less expectant of a superb valve partnership / contract then prior to today's release, I think that is further down the line.

So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

Now the final accounts have been reported I hope RUA have something to say soon, at the least about H1 when the period ends. I notice the wording regarding the valve is 'serious interest' which means nothing on it's own but coupled with the 'off book' comment it becomes interesting (a hint at a partnership).  Is this just designed to lead me down a road or is that as much as they can say. The information on medical devices division is interesting, for me this is still the most important area to develop and they have provided far more information on timescales than before, this suggests to me some early stage prospects are reaching significant milestones but are still likely to be years off. I hope there are some projects in the pipeline that don't require years of R&D and maybe even another Abiss to put the cash to good use. The share still looks dirt cheap to me but I think you need a medium term view on it. I can see drip selling until news drops.",

They were originally the cornerstone investor in the 2020 equity raise at 120p buying around 1.7m shares (8% at the time) but started selling out after the setback FDA ruling a year later but they held onto the rump according to their holdings disclosures. I looked up Amati and found that Amati VCT had become Maven Renovar VCT. The following two extracts from the Maven website shows they are selling a lot of their AIM portfolio. From Maven website and fact sheet: \u201cThe investment objective of Maven Renovar VCT PLC (formerly Amati AIM VCT plc)\u00a0is to generate tax free capital gains and income on investors' funds, through investment primarily in AIM-traded companies.\u201d \u201cOUTLOOK The Board have declared interim and special dividends totalling 5.00p per Share, paid in November from the VCT\u2019s existing liquidity. As previously outlined in the 2025 Interim Report, the Manager intends to make further sales from the AIM portfolio and it is anticipated that the proceeds will be distributed to Shareholders through further dividends and potentially a tender offer on which the Board intends to consult Shareholders. We believe this strategy will protect value, return investors\u2019 capital efficiently, and offers an exit for Shareholders seeking to realise their investment in full.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, someone has been selling round amounts of RUA into the recent strength for quite a while so it would make sense that these guys are partly responsible.

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

Now the final accounts have been reported I hope RUA have something to say soon, at the least about H1 when the period ends. I notice the wording regarding the valve is 'serious interest' which means nothing on it's own but coupled with the 'off book' comment it becomes interesting (a hint at a partnership).  Is this just designed to lead me down a road or is that as much as they can say. The information on medical devices division is interesting, for me this is still the most important area to develop and they have provided far more information on timescales than before, this suggests to me some early stage prospects are reaching significant milestones but are still likely to be years off. I hope there are some projects in the pipeline that don't require years of R&D and maybe even another Abiss to put the cash to good use. The share still looks dirt cheap to me but I think you need a medium term view on it. I can see drip selling until news drops.",

          "content": "The round sum selling today and in recent weeks got me thinking. One holding that has always puzzled me was the rump of about 775k shares held by Amati VCT. They were originally the cornerstone investor in the 2020 equity raise at 120p buying around 1.7m shares (8% at the time) but started selling out after the setback FDA ruling a year later but they held onto the rump according to their holdings disclosures. I looked up Amati and found that Amati VCT had become Maven Renovar VCT. The following two extracts from the Maven website shows they are selling a lot of their AIM portfolio. From Maven website and fact sheet: \u201cThe investment objective of Maven Renovar VCT PLC (formerly Amati AIM VCT plc)\u00a0is to generate tax free capital gains and income on investors' funds, through investment primarily in AIM-traded companies.\u201d \u201cOUTLOOK The Board have declared interim and special dividends totalling 5.00p per Share, paid in November from the VCT\u2019s existing liquidity. As previously outlined in the 2025 Interim Report, the Manager intends to make further sales from the AIM portfolio and it is anticipated that the proceeds will be distributed to Shareholders through further dividends and potentially a tender offer on which the Board intends to consult Shareholders. We believe this strategy will protect value, return investors\u2019 capital efficiently, and offers an exit for Shareholders seeking to realise their investment in full.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, someone has been selling round amounts of RUA into the recent strength for quite a while so it would make sense that these guys are partly responsible. It\u2019s possible but not proved!",

I am less expectant of a superb valve partnership / contract then prior to today's release, I think that is further down the line.

          "content": "The Cavendish broker notes are not independent research and they are released on the same morning as the relevant RNS that they briefly talk about. So, the notes are worked on closely with RUA using embargoed numbers. What to draw from that? First, I would say that whatever is published by Cavendish has the prior blessing of the RUA board so in a way reflects the company view of how the market should be valuing it. The notes are couched in broad and general terms so as not to depart too far from the information in the published RNS that prompted it. At the end, the broker publishes its target price. Can we infer that this is something the company and the broker debate and agree on? What we know from the Cavendish notes is that, up to and including the 9/9/24 note on the ABISS acquisition, the target price was stated as 25p. Seven months later, on the 28/4/25 trading update for the 12 months ending March, the target price had been hiked to 50p. Doesn\u2019t sound especially scientific to me but maybe, given how the company could see developments and negotiations in the background coming on, they argued for this higher target as being reasonable. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that the Cavendish notes generally end with this statement: \u201cWe believe the progress indicates RUA is a significantly de-risked, revenue-generating business with numerous growth opportunities, pointing to a valuation above the current market value. Further, the largely developed but strategically de-emphasised graft and valve products offer \u2018free\u2019 upside opportunities above the value of the core business.\u201d That last bit is what potentially excites the crowd and it\u2019s not priced in. The market needs to see it happen, then the crowd will come running.",

          "content": "From google AI: UK AIM company RUA has a market cap of \u00a38.69m as a value play and or growth play does this look like an investment that might soon pay off (one way or the other)? As of January 23, 2026, RUA Life Sciences PLC (RUA) presents a complex investment profile. While its \u00a38.69 million market capitalization places it in the high-risk \"small-cap\" category, recent financial milestones suggest it is transitioning from a speculative R&D phase toward commercial viability. Investment Profile: Growth vs. Value Growth Potential: RUA has demonstrated significant top-line expansion, reporting an 86% surge in revenue to \u00a34.1 million for the fiscal year ending March 2025. Analysts from Simply Wall St project future annual revenue growth of approximately 15.4%, which is notably faster than the overall UK market's 4.3%. Value Outlook: Some analysts consider the company undervalued. Equity Development recently set a valuation target of \u00a3120.3 million (542p per share), and the consensus analyst price target reported by Stockopedia is 50.00p\u2014a potential upside of over 250% from current levels (~14p). Key Performance Indicators (2025\u20132026) The company's investment \"payoff\" depends heavily on its path to profitability. Metric Latest Reported Data Current Share Price 15.12p (as of Jan 23, 2026) Market Cap \u00a38.69m - \u00a39.00m Revenue (FY 2025) \u00a34.1 million (86% year-on-year increase) Profitability Achieved positive EBITDA in FY2025; predicted to reach full breakeven by 2026. Financial Risk Low debt levels; debt currently makes up only 2.3% of equity. Analysis: Will it pay off soon? Whether this investment pays off \"one way or the other\" involves two distinct scenarios: The Upside (Payoff): RUA appears to have reached a \"commercial inflection point\". Its strategy of using partnerships to fund product development (e.g., RUA Structural Heart) is intended to conserve cash and accelerate the path to its first annual profit in 2026. The Risks: Despite the revenue growth, Simply Wall St warns that earnings are forecast to decline by 60.5% per annum over the next three years, citing a \"weak\" Return on Equity (ROE) compared to the industry average. The stock is currently classified by some as a \"Momentum Trap\", meaning its recent price gains may not yet be supported by long-term fundamental stability. Verdict: RUA currently looks more like a speculative growth play than a traditional value play. The \"payoff\" likely hinges on the company meeting its 2026 profitability targets and securing further commercial partnerships. Would you like to see a more detailed breakdown of RUA's individual business segments, such as their vascular or structural heart divisions, to better assess their long-term growth potential?",

Last year saw some previously unloved microcap biotech names like STX and IMM rerate fairly spectacularly. I actually think RUA is superior because it has a rare combination of that biotech growth story coupled with a robust balance sheet underpinned by a growing revenue stream. Suspect 2026 may well the year market finally wakes up to this.",
