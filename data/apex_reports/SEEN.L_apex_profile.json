Revenue for 1H25 increased 87% against 1H24, with the Group signing what is potentially its largest ever contract to supply YouTube Creator Service Partner (\"CSP\") services, which is expected to be worth approximately $3.5 million in annual revenues upon completion of milestones. To date, this contract is currently worth $1.0 million in annual revenues. The Group is working to achieve these milestones during the next 12 months.\nGross profit increased by 62%, as the sales mix drove a slightly lower margin than in 1H24. This has meant that the Group maintained positive monthly operating cash flow, allowing for atypical working capital movements, driven primarily by timing of supplier payments, during the period.\nShareholders demonstrated their support for the Group by providing additional growth capital through the exercise of warrants and, combined with the Group's operating cashflow during the period, this resulted in cash of $1.4m as at 30 June 2025, up from $1.0m as at 31 December 2024.\nOutlook and Interview\nGrowth has continued into the second half with the Board now expecting for revenue for the 12 months to December 2025 to be in excess of $5.0m, backed by an increasing annualised revenue run-rate** of approximately $6.5 million as at the current date, an increase from $5.8 million at the end of 1H25.\nAdrian Hargrave, Chief Executive Officer of SEEEN, will discuss the Company's interim results and trading update with focusIR. Details can be found here:\nhttps://media.focusir.com/SEEEN1H25Results\nAdrian Hargrave, CEO of SEEEN, commented:\n\"Our upward turn is now in full swing - both in terms of sales and EBITDA. As announced a few weeks ago, our first half of 2025 saw the Group continue to grow its operations rapidly. Since the end of the period, we have continued signing up new business and we are confident that we will achieve more than $5 million in revenues during the 2025 full year, with the potential to do significantly better, given that Q4 is traditionally our strongest quarter.\nMarket demand for AI-infused video moments is very strong and we are well-positioned for customers ranging from content creators to product companies seeking to boost sales and training, as well as to better service customers, and sports organisations. We have successfully managed to grow both the CSP and the technology parts of our business and we have seen increased cross-selling and increased demand from clients for our full product suite.\nI am also very grateful to our shareholders for their ongoing support for the business, including the recent warrant exercise to provide further capital to the Group. From our now solid foundation, we can deploy capital to accelerate customer growth, potentially through partnerships or acquisitions, in sectors where our combined offering of CSP and technology is strongest, such as sports, commerce and music.\nI look forward to a strong finish to 2025 and maintaining our rapid growth momentum for the foreseeable future.\"\n1H25 Financial Highlights***\nRevenues\n\u25cf\nTotal Group revenues of $2.1m, 87% up on previous year (1H24: $1.1m)\nProfitability\n\u25cf\nGross profit of $0.6 million, 62% higher than 1H24 as all parts of the business exhibited growth\n\u25cf\nAdjusted Group EBITDA profit* of $0.1m (1H24: loss of $0.3m), reflecting the Group's revenue growth combined with prudent cost management\nBalance Sheet\n\u25cf\nCash as at 30 June 2025 of approximately $1.4m providing flexibility for selective investment in partnerships or acquisitions to accelerate growth\nYear To Date New Customer Wins and Implementation Success\n\u25cf\nTotal new business won since start of 2025 currently worth more than $1.5 million in annualised revenues**\n\u25cf\nContinued progress with selling the Group's technology products across different verticals, with particular traction in the sports and charitable foundation verticals for technology products\no\nAverage 9% clickthrough rates, linked to sales, within customer videos is driving over 100% ROI for certain key customers\n\u25cf\nInitial pilots with re-sellers for selling technology into specific verticals\n\u25cf\nUpsells of technology services to CSP customers, which has driven up to 25% increases in the revenues of certain key customers\n2025 and 2026 Outlook\n\u25cf\nStrong customer and reseller sales pipeline, driven by technology products, CSP opportunities and sales team\no\nSignificant large opportunities with sports clubs, sports leagues and major publishers\no\nConverting initial pilots with re-sellers into full contracts and distribution\no\nSales to companies of Video Moment technology to accelerate skills training and compliance\no\nPotential acquisition or partnership opportunities to accelerate customer acquisition\nNotes:\n* See Note 5 to the financial statements for a full reconciliation of adjustments between reported and adjusted figures.\n** Annualised revenues assumes a run rate of revenues combining (i) technology based SaaS sales and (ii) current levels of YouTube advertising income from channel partners, which can be more volatile.\n*** 1H24 figures have been restated in some areas to make these figures consistent with audit adjustments noted in the Group's annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024, which was released on 11 September 2025\nFor further information please contact:\nSEEEN plc\nAdrian Hargrave, CEO\nTel: +44 (0)7775 701 838\nWebsite:\nseeen.com\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser\n)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nAlex Brearley / Lauren Wright (Corporate Finance)\nDowgate Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nStephen Norcross / Amber Higgs\nTel: +44(0)20 3903 7721\nCapital Plus Partners Limited (Joint Broker)\nJonathan Critchley\nTel: +44(0)20 3821 6167\nfocusIR (Investor Relations)\nPaul Cornelius / Kat Perez\nTel: +44(0) 07866 384 707\nseeen@focusir.com\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\").\nCEO's Statement\nOverview\nDuring 1H25 and into the third quarter, we have continued to execute on our strategy of selling our technology products and associated CSP services to customers across our target markets. This focus has driven substantial growth, with revenues in 1H25 increasing by 87% against 1H24 to $2.1 million, alongside a 62% improvement in gross profit to $0.5 million. Importantly, this growth enabled the Group to first achieve monthly operating cash flow breakeven in December 2024, a position we have maintained through the first half of 2025, allowing for atypical movements in working capital, described in more detail below.\nIn addition to expanding our customer base, we have secured larger-scale contracts, including signing what is potentially our largest ever CSP services contract, expected to be worth approximately $3.5 million in annual revenues upon completion of milestones. To date, this contract has contributed $1 million in annualised revenues. Momentum has continued post-period, with our annualised revenue run-rate** increasing to approximately $6.5 million at present, up from $5.8 million at the end of 1H25.\nWe have also continued to achieve notable wins in the sports and entertainment verticals, where our technology powers video-led websites, video commerce, and interactive engagement. Across these customers, we continue to see strong engagement metrics, with an average 9% clickthrough rate from sports videos, linked directly to sales, driving in some cases 100%+ ROI.\nFurthermore, we continue to deepen relationships with CSP customers, upselling our technology solutions to leverage their back catalogues more efficiently. These upsells have enabled certain key customers to drive up to 25% more revenue through enhanced clipping, re-mixing, and video commerce functionality.\nOur implementations continue to generate valuable case studies that demonstrate strong ROI and repeatable sales patterns. These case studies are now accelerating larger opportunities with sports clubs, leagues, and major publishers, as well as opening reseller opportunities with digital marketing agencies that are adopting our video commerce solution as a differentiated offering for their clients. In addition to this, we have been piloting our training solutions based on Key Video Moments and we expect this to be an additional driver of growth in 2026.\nOur strengthened financial position underpins this growth trajectory. As at 30 June 2025, the Group held approximately $1.4 million in cash. During the period, the Group generated cash flow from operations before working capital movements of $0.1 million, offset by atypical supplier payment timings which led to a net cash outflow from operating activities of $0.5 million. In addition, certain of the Group's shareholders exercised warrants during the period. The Group's cash position provides the flexibility for selective investment in partnerships or acquisitions to accelerate customer acquisition.\nOutlook\nThe first nine months of 2025 have demonstrated both the scalability and profitability of our solutions, delivering strong revenue growth and repeatable sales across multiple industries. With a robust sales pipeline that includes significant opportunities in sports, publishing, training, and digital marketing, as well as expansion through resellers and strategic partners, we are well-positioned to build on our progress.\nWe are extremely grateful to all of our shareholders for their support, including the warrant exercise in May 2025, and will look to create significant shareholder value by executing our growth plan. Our next milestones remain focused on the continued scaling of all our offering , including potential corporate activity, to accelerate and capitalise on the increasing demand for short- form video-led solutions.\nAdrian Hargrave, CEO\nSeptember 30, 2025\nInterim Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025\nSix months\nended\n30 June 2025\nSix

a global media and technology platform that delivers Key Video Moments and Video Commerce to transform its clients' video profitability.\nThe Company is a public limited company domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated under registered number 10621059 in England and Wales. The Company's registered office is 27-28 Eastcastle Street, London W1W 8DH.\n2 Significant accounting policies\nBasis of preparation and changes to the Group's accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial information are consistent with those of the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for both the completed period ended 31 December 2024 and anticipated period ending 31 December 2025. No new IFRS standards, amendments or interpretations became effective in the six months to 30 June 2025.\nStatement of compliance\nThis interim consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 has been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards (\"Adopted IFRSs\"). This interim consolidated financial information is not the Group's statutory financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS and have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their report was unqualified and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is unaudited. In the opinion of the Directors, the interim consolidated financial information presents fairly the financial position, and results from operations and cash flows for the period. Comparative numbers for the six months ended 30 June 2024 are unaudited.\nThis interim consolidated financial information is presented in US Dollars ($), rounded to the nearest dollar.\nForeign currencies\nFunctional and presentational currency\nItems included in this interim consolidated financial information are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates which is considered by the Directors to be Pounds Sterling (\u00a3) for the Parent Company and US Dollars ($) for all the Company's subsidiaries. This interim consolidated financial information has been presented in US Dollars which represents the dominant economic environment in which represents the dominant economic environment in which the Group operates. The effective exchange rate at 30 June 2025 was \u00a31 = US$1.373 (30 June 2023: \u00a31 = US$1.266 and 31 December 2024: \u00a31 = US$1.252).\nCritical accounting estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of interim consolidated financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.\nIn preparing this interim consolidated financial information, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, together with the recognition of development expenditure, described below.\nDevelopment expenditure\nThe Group recognises costs incurred on development projects as an intangible asset which satisfies the requirements of IAS 38. The calculation of the costs incurred includes the percentage of time spent by certain employees and contractors on relevant development projects. The decision whether to capitalise and how to determine the period of economic benefit of development projects requires an assessment of the commercial viability of the projects and the prospect of selling the project to new or existing customers. During the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Group capitalized $0.2m of development expenditure (1H24: $0.5m).\nGoing Concern\nThe directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future, and for this reason they have adopted the going concern basis of preparation in the consolidated interim financial statements.\n3 Trade Payable and Receivables\nThe majority of trade payables and receivables relate to receivables from YouTube and payables to creator partners. In addition, trade and other payables includes accruals for expenses to be accrued during the year, payments to consultants who are paid monthly in arrears and historic liabilities of the acquired businesses that relate to payables more than two years ago and the Group does not expect to need to pay.\n4 Loss per share\nThe loss per share has been calculated using the loss for the period and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, as follows:\nSix months ended\n30 June 2025\nSix months ended\n30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December\n2024\n(restated)\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nEarnings attributable to shareholders of the Company ($)\n(516,953)\n(883,257)\n(2,425,280)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\n122,347,892\n95,451,309\n107,841,702\nDiluted weighted average number of ordinary shares\n122,347,892\n95,451,309\n107,841,702\nLoss per share (cents)\n(0.42)\n(0.93)\n(2.25)\nDiluted loss per share (cents)\n(0.42)\n(0.93)\n(2.25)\n5 Summary of Adjustments between Reported and Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Profit\n$\n1H25 Reported\nAdjustment\n1H25 Adjusted\nRevenues\n2,055,095\n-\n2,055,095\nCost of Sales\n(1,523,344)\n-\n(1,523,344)\nGross Profit\n531,751\n-\n531,751\nOperating expenses\n(1,023,415)\n-\n(1,023,415)\nShare based payments\n(389)\n389\n-\nOther adjustments\n-\n-\n-\nOperating Profit\n(491,664)\n389\n(491,275)\nAmortisation - Development cost\n(584,444)\n-\n(584,444)\nEBITDA\n93,169\n-\n93,558\n6 Publication of announcement and the Interim Results\nA copy of this announcement will be available at the Company's registered office (27-28 Eastcastle Street, London, W1W 8DH) from the date of this announcement and on its website -\nseeen.com\n.
