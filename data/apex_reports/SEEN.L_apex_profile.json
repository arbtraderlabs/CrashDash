During 2023, the Company's position has strengthened in the marketplace, as video commerce is becoming more important for all video asset owners. This was clearly illustrated at our recent Technology Demo Day. We have progressed along the key dimensions of a successful growth plan:\n\u00b7\nNew commercial sales in our target sectors worth more than $1 million in annual revenue:\no\nStrategic customer #1 - FAST channel for whom we have used our AI to create new content, including their most watched short form video of all time with more than 30 million views across all platforms\no\nStrategic customer #2 - Technology-led sale to a major US financial publisher to create a bespoke site leveraging video content from their events to drive greater levels of ticket sales\no\nAddition of 14 vertical and e-commerce customers across sports, financial publishing and brands, driving increased views, sales and engagement\n\u00b7\nCreation of a sales organisation\no\nHiring of sales people in the UK and the US to focus on our key markets. This team works closely with both the technology and the CSP team to drive customer success, resulting in successful self-serve deployments, as well as bespoke integrations, such as automatically filling shopping carts within e-commerce platforms\n\u00b7\nExpanding sales pipeline\no\nGrowing pipeline of opportunities across all target markets, including larger opportunities that could be worth in excess of $2 million in annual revenues\n\u00a7\nFocus on both technology and CSP sales with potential for cross-selling to customers\n\u00b7\nPrioritising technology sales while integrating and increasing the profitability of SEEEN's CSP\no\nIncreasing use of our technology offering for our CSP partner channels, driving higher margin business with channels that want to do better with short form content and drive video commerce\n\u00b7\nProgress towards cash flow positive\no\nImproving gross margin reflects focus on technology-led sales and a more profitable CSP business\no\nDevelopment of product stack successfully completed to allow execution against current sales pipeline, the Group's cost base is now focused on delivering sales\n\u00b7\nDespite the focus on profitability, we have reinvested in our technology offering to build sustainable value by delivering proprietary offerings to attack a large and growing market opportunity\no\nRelease of\nCreatorSuite 2.0\n, including Shoppable Video Prompts, Fully Customisable End Cards and advertising, building on our previous Key Video Moment technology\no\nShortsCut\nis already being used by some of our larger CSP partners to find relevant short form content for publication and re-mixing, this will be more aggressively rolled out in 4Q 23\nOn 14 September, we showcased our progress in a coherent way at our Technology Demo Day, bringing together shareholders, customers and partners. During this technology day, we outlined how our technology benefits customers, both through an interactive panel who described how the video landscape is changing and how SEEEN's platform offering helps them, as well as through six case studies across different use cases, highlighting statistics such as how SEEEN has helped deliver up to 25% clickthrough rates on video commerce opportunities, driven a doubling of conversion rates and created short form videos for content owners that have delivered over 30 million views by creating Key Video Moments from within their existing collection. Since the event, we have received inbound requests from potential customers who have seen the use cases for our customers and would like to adapt SEEEN's offering to their videos.\nThe whole event is available to view at\nseeen.com/techday/videos\n, as well as Key Video Moments from the event for investors and customers to learn more about our offering.\nAs we head into 4Q, we have strengthened the Company's fundamentals and competitive value propositions and we appreciate the support of our shareholders in helping us to achieve this.\nBelow I go into more detail about the market opportunity, our products are ready to meet this opportunity and sales prospects. We are on track to achieve monthly cash flow breakeven and create significant shareholder value by continuing to execute our plan and capitalising on the market opportunity available for us.\nThe Market Opportunity\nDespite the macroeconomic headwinds, two of the key markets in which the Group operates are expected to grow strongly, being the video commerce market and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology within video.\nSince late 2022, there has been a strengthening of interest in AI solutions, including Large Language Models, such as Open AI, and generative AI technologies, such as Stability.ai and Dall-e, as well as nascent generative video AI tools including synthesia.io. This increase in awareness of AI is expected to lead to a near 20% CAGR for the global generative AI video market through to 2032 (source: Market.us) and a large part of this is driven by the other significant trend, the shift to mass online consumption especially in video.\nThis shift is driven by a few core trends; the generational shift to online consumption during Covid-19, the increasing speed of data transfer provided by 5G, allowing reliable video viewing on mobiles and tablets; and the rise of social media platforms.\nVideo is increasingly the medium by which all generations consume information and, therefore, the video commerce market, which is a core focus for SEEEN, is expected to grow rapidly as well. This is evidenced by the fact that all social video platforms have increasingly sought to integrate video commerce into their offering, in addition to the traditional advertising route. In fact, this market is expected to grow by 32% a year into a global market of $2.8 trillion (source: Reportlinker). In addition, other online video markets are also expected to grow at more than 10% a year, regardless of the economic backdrop. Whilst everyone is aware of the social video platforms, publishers, brands and sports clubs all host a lot of video content on their site, which is expensive to create and will be increasingly viewed.\nIn order to increase their return on investment, video owners need tools to (i) increase their yield from existing videos and (ii) find a way of better leveraging their back catalogue of video to create \"new\" content that viewers will want to watch. As I describe below and the case studies from our Technology Demo Day show, we have solutions that have already directly addressed both of these needs.\nSEEEN's Solutions\nSEEEN provides the solutions to meet the market opportunity to monetise video more efficiently. Our Shoppable Video Prompts (\"SVPs\") are unique in the market for the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nThey are combined with Key Video Moments to capitalise on short viewer attention spans and serve up a contextual offer\n\u00b7\nThey enable fully bespoke and clickable prompts with direct integration into shopping carts\n\u00b7\nThey can be provided as both in-video SVPs, as well as end cards at the end of a Key Video Moment, maximising conversion rates\n\u00b7\nWe allow video owners to run adverts, as well as include SVPs, therefore allowing them to \"double dip\" on revenue opportunities\nThe success of our Shoppable Video Prompts is seen in the clickthrough rates (CTRs) that clients achieve using our technology. Our highest CTR rates for individual videos are above 25%, but across the board we have achieved 10%+ CTRs, which compares with typical average rates of 3-5%. In addition, product pages including our SVPs within a video have resulted in double the rate of customer conversion versus product pages without video.\nOur offering allows customers to use video to increase engagement and revenues both from sales of their own products and subscriptions, as well as third party affiliate sales, which is especially important to publishers, but can also apply to any video owner who wants to integrate their offering with other businesses.\nIn addition to\nCreatorSuite 2.0\n, we have also developed\nShortsCut\n, which can search a video collection for any topic by word, phrase, image or activity. It has been tested with some of our CSP channels and has already generated content that has received more than 30 million views, bringing revenue and much increased awareness to our customers. We are continuing to add new features in-house to this product, which we will roll out more aggressively during 4Q 23 and 2024.\nFinally, all of our AI is driven by\nJetStream\n, our AI backbone, which can run multiple analysis models in parallel, speeding up the results generated for a customer. We have continued to strengthen our in-house models, but increasingly we are capable of creating bespoke model sets for customers who want to search for specific objects, people and activities.\nOutlook\nOur solutions meet a growing market need, by delivering both increased yield from videos and the ability to generate \"new\" content from existing video libraries. We have products that are selling and a growing pipeline with contract sizes ranging to in excess of $2 million in revenues per year annually. We will continue to look to accelerate the pace of sales and adoption throughout the remainder of 2023 and 2024 in order to drive us to monthly cash flow breakeven. In a fast-moving sector, we continuously monitor market trends and are looking to find opportunities to accelerate our growth, either through partnerships or acquisitions, as well as listening to customer demand for new features and products that might need to be developed. We look forward to continuing to execute against our strategy and delivering a highly valuable company in a fast-growing sector for our shareholders.\nAdrian Hargrave\nCEO\nSeptember 29, 2023\nInterim

technology platform that delivers Key Video Moments and Video Commerce to transform its clients' video profitability.\nThe Company is a public limited company domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated under registered number 10621059 in England and Wales. The Company's registered office is 27-28 Eastcastle Street, London W1W 8DH.\n2 Significant accounting policies\nBasis of preparation and changes to the Group's accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial information are consistent with those of the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2022. No new IFRS standards, amendments or interpretations became effective in the six months to 30 June 2023.\nStatement of compliance\nThis interim consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2023 has been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards (\"Adopted IFRSs\"). This interim consolidated financial information is not the Group's statutory financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS and have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their report was unqualified, did not include references to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis of matter without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2023 is unaudited. In the opinion of the Directors, the interim consolidated financial information presents fairly the financial position, and results from operations and cash flows for the period. Comparative numbers for the six months ended 30 June 2022 are unaudited.\nThis interim consolidated financial information is presented in US Dollars ($), rounded to the nearest dollar.\nForeign currencies\nFunctional and presentational currency\nItems included in this interim consolidated financial information are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates which is considered by the Directors to be Pounds Sterling (\u00a3) for the Parent Company and US Dollars ($) for all the Company's subsidiaries. This interim consolidated financial information has been presented in US Dollars which represents the dominant economic environment in which represents the dominant economic environment in which the Group operates. The effective exchange rate at 30 June 2023 was \u00a31 = US$1.2714 (30 June 2022: \u00a31 = US$1.2175 and 31 December 2022: \u00a31 = US$1.2098).\nCritical accounting estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of interim consolidated financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.\nIn preparing this interim consolidated financial information, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, together with the recognition of development expenditure, described below.\nDevelopment expenditure\nThe Group recognises costs incurred on development projects as an intangible asset which satisfies the requirements of IAS 38. The calculation of the costs incurred includes the percentage of time spent by certain employees and contractors on relevant development projects. The decision whether to capitalise and how to determine the period of economic benefit of development projects requires an assessment of the commercial viability of the projects and the prospect of selling the project to new or existing customers. During the period, the Group capitalized $459,560 of development expenditure.\nGoing Concern\nThe directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future, and for this reason they have adopted the going concern basis of preparation in the consolidated interim financial statements.\n3 Trade Payable and Receivables\nThe majority of trade payables and receivables relate to receivables from YouTube and payables to creator partners. In addition, trade and other payables includes accruals for expenses to be accrued during the year, payments to consultants who are paid monthly in arrears and historic liabilities of the acquired businesses that relate to payables more than two years ago and the Group does not expect to need to pay.\n4 Loss per share\nThe loss per share has been calculated using the loss for the period and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, as follows:\nSix months ended\n30 June 2023\nSix months ended\n30 June 2022\nYear ended\n31 December\n2022\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nEarnings attributable to shareholders of the Company ($)\n(1,435,039)\n(1,404,468)\n(10,271,676)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\n93,345,815\n49,957,876\n50,131,428\nDiluted weighted average number of ordinary shares\n93,345,815\n49,957,876\n50,131,428\nLoss per share (cents)\n(1.5)\n(2.8)\n(20.48)\nDiluted loss per share (cents)\n(1.5)\n(2.8)\n(20.48)\n5 Summary of Adjustments between Reported and Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Profit\n$ in 000s\n1H23 Reported\nAdjustment\n1H23 Adjusted\nRevenues\n1,130\n-\n1,130\nCost of Sales\n(851)\n-\n(851)\nGross Profit\n279\n-\n279\nOperating expenses\n(1,813)\n-\n(1,813)\nShare based payments\n-\n55\n55\nOther adjustments\n-\n60\n60\nOperating Profit\n(1,534)\n115\n(1,419)\nAmortisation - Development cost\n478\n-\n478\nAmortisation - acquired intangibles\n595\n-\n595\nEBITDA\n(461)\n-\n(346)\n6 Publication of announcement and the Interim Results\nA copy of this announcement will be available at the Company's registered office (27-28 Eastcastle Street, London, W1W 8DH) from the date of this announcement and on its website -\nseeen.com\n.
