The patent provides Composition of Matter, the strongest form of patent cover available, conferring long-term exclusivity and significantly strengthening the commercial and partnering proposition for the programme.\nThe Group also reports continued progress on\nits Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose Range Finding (DRF) studies, which commenced earlier this month. The MTD have now been successfully completed, with two species dosed up to the regulatory maximum, 1g/kg of the orexin-1 blocker, with no adverse clinical observations reported. This favourable outcome further de-risks the programme and enables progression into repeat-dose DRF studies, the results of which will inform the dosing for the planned 28-day regulatory toxicity studies scheduled in Q1 and Q2 2026, depending on species. This is a near final step on the path to IND/CTA readiness targeted for 2026.\nOx-1, TheraCryf's lead programme, is a novel, best-in-class orexin-1 blocker, being developed as\na potential treatment for addiction, including alcohol and other substance use disorders. The programme demonstrates class-leading selectivity and high receptor occupancy, characteristics which are expected to translate into improved tolerability and efficacy. Blocking the orexin-1 pathway has been shown to reduce aberrant substance-seeking behaviour in animal models, and the orexin pathway has attracted strong interest in the pharmaceutical sector.\nAddiction represents a large and growing global market, with substantial unmet medical need and significant human, social and economic impact, making it an attractive indication for development and commercialisation.\nDr Helen Kuhlman, Chief Operating Officer of TheraCryf, commented\n:\n\"Securing the Canadian patent completes coverage across all major commercial markets for our Ox-1 programme and strengthens its long-term value\n. Completion of our maximum tolerated dose studies further de-risks our best-in-class lead asset as we progress towards clinical readiness.\nWe remain well positioned to generate key value inflection data and advance Ox-1 towards partnering opportunities.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nSinger Capital Markets (NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nPhil Davies\n/ Patrick Weaver\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nTurner Pope Investments (Joint Broker)\nGuy McDougall / Andy Thacker\n+44 (0)20 3657 0050\nNorthstar Communications (Investor Relations)\nSarah Hollins\n+44 (0)113 730 3896\nsarah@northstarcommunications.co.uk\nAbout TheraCryf\nTheraCryf plc is a biotechnology company developing new medicines for addiction and other disorders of the brain, areas of significant unmet medical need within central nervous system (CNS) disorders.\nThe Group's lead programme is a novel, best-in-class orexin-1 receptor antagonist being developed as a potential treatment for addiction, including binge eating, alcohol and other substance use disorders. The programme is heavily de-risked, demonstrates superior selectivity and high receptor occupancy, and is fully funded through to clinical readiness, with regulatory submissions targeted for 2026.\nTheraCryf also has a dopamine transporter (DAT) modulator programme addressing fatigue of brain origin, including fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy and narcolepsy. The Group also has a legacy, grant-funded, oncology programme in glioblastoma with SFX-01.\nThe Group operates a capital-light, virtual development model\nadvancing programmes to early clinical or proof-of-concept stage before partnering with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.\nTheraCryf's headquarters and registered office are at Alderley Park, Cheshire.\nFor further information, visit:\nhttps://theracryf.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Scale-up of the Ox-1 compound to 10kg has now been achieved on schedule and with a yield in excess of expectations.\nThis drug substance will be used in the 28-day regulatory toxicology studies scheduled to commence, in Q1 and Q2, this year in two species. These studies will provide essential data for the planned regulatory submission later in the year and represent the last major hurdle to achieving that goal.\nBefore starting the 28-day toxicology studies, the Maximum Tolerated Dose and Dose Range Finding studies need to be completed. This work has now started. These\nstudies will identify the 'therapeutic index' of the orexin-1 blocker - that is the range between which the dose is expected to have a therapeutic effect and the highest dose of compound reached before any harmful effects are observed.\nOx-1 is TheraCryf's lead asset, an orexin-1 blocker, being developed as\na potential treatment for addiction, blocks a pathway in the brain (orexin-1) known to be over-active in individuals with addiction. This group of conditions have significant human and economic impact globally. Blocking the overactivity of this pathway is known to reduce aberrant substance seeking behaviour in animal models. Drugs that can block this pathway have generated significant commercial interest and Theracryf's orexin-1 blocker is the most selective yet developed, indicating class leading potential.\nInvestor Webinar\nDr Huw Jones, Chief Executive Officer, and Dr Alastair Smith, Non-executive Chair, will be presenting a webinar hosted by TheraCryf's joint broker, Turner Pope Investments, at 6:00p.m. on Thursday, 8 January 2026.\nThe webinar will look at the progress made by TheraCryf in 2025 in driving its lead Ox-1 orexin blocker programme towards clinical trial readiness and also the potential milestones and value inflection points for TheraCryf coming up in 2026, including manufacturing scale-up as described above. A Q&A session will follow the main presentation.\nThe webinar is freely available for all existing and potential investors.

More than 80% of patients with multiple sclerosis suffer from fatigue and report it as the most common and debilitating symptom3. This overwhelming cognitive exhaustion, which is not simply being 'tired', severely impacts daily life. Currently there are no approved treatments for fatigue in these patients.\nThe potential market opportunity for treating chronic fatigue was estimated at US$1.2 billion in 2024 with the market expected to reach US$2.3 billion by 20331.\nGrowing scientific interest in the origins of mental fatigue is underscored by the recent\nNature\narticle2 by Lynne Peeples which highlights the research being undertaken to discover the roots of mental fatigue which could point to treatments for these debilitating disorders. Dopamine plays a major role in alertness and motivation with low levels being linked to fatigue states4.\nCurrent treatments include stimulants, such as amphetamines, which produce a rapid rise in dopamine, however, they are associated with significant side effects and a high potential for abuse because of the 'rush'-like feelings they produce.\nTheraCryf's DAT asset is differentiated by its ability to gradually increase levels of brain dopamine without the 'rush'-like profile, potentially providing a treatment that alleviates mental fatigue without abuse liability.\nElevating dopamine levels can also lead to increased wakefulness and the DAT asset has demonstrated positive preclinical proof of concept in connection with this, in models of drug-induced fatigue, MS fatigue and narcolepsy. The narcolepsy treatment market alone was valued at US$3.48 billion in 2024\u00a0and is expected to reach US$7.73 billion by 20325.\nDr Huw Jones, CEO of TheraCryf commented\n:\n\"Disease and treatment-related fatigue is a very serious issue for patients who are already severely affected by several underlying conditions. A therapeutic that could target these symptoms is clearly needed and the increase in research efforts and the associated market value related to fatigue make this a very attractive path to pursue.\n\"\nOur dopamine modulator is differentiated and highly selective, with strong potential in the large and growing area of central nervous system fatigue. While we progress our lead Ox-1 orexin blocker programme, we continue to explore the significant potential of the DAT programme for future development or licensing.\"\n-Ends-\n1.

In addition, it has a short path to being ready to go into human trials next year - a major value inflection point which is certainly not reflected in the current valuation.\n\"I joined the board as Chair in February and, following a strategic review and a re-capitalisation of the company, the team has delivered strongly on the strategy to focus on our valuable CNS assets as the best route to delivering significant shareholder value.\n\"I anticipate multiple opportunities for strong news flow in Q1 and throughout 2026 as we drive towards the clinic and I look forward to working with the team to ensure the value of these important steps in the company's growth is communicated effectively.\"\nDr Huw Jones, Chief Executive Officer of TheraCryf, said:\n\"We have prioritised our addiction programme this year based on unmet medical need and potential market size, and a commitment to deliver value to shareholders.

The Company has a broad clinical and preclinical pipeline in indications including addiction, anxiety, fatigue, narcolepsy, glioblastoma** and neurodevelopmental disorders [**orphan indication].\nThe Company's strategy is to generate compelling data sets to preclinical and/or clinical proof of concept and partner its clinical programmes with mid-size to large pharma for larger trials and commercialisation. It also has a number of industry partnerships with companies, including Stalicla SA, in neurodevelopmental disorders. The Company has sourced know-how for programmes from companies such as Shire (now Takeda).\nTheraCryf has worked with and has ongoing collaborations with major universities and hospitals such as the University of\u00a0Manchester, La Sapienza (Universit\u00e0 di\u00a0Roma), the Erasmus Medical Centre,\u00a0Rotterdam, Kings College London and the University of\u00a0Michigan.\nThe Company has its headquarters and registered office at Alderley Park,\u00a0Cheshire.\u00a0It is quoted on AIM in\u00a0London\u00a0and trades under the ticker symbol TCF.\nFor further information, please visit:\nwww.theracryf.com\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE\nLEAD PROGRAMME\nOx-11 in Addiction\nFollowing the \u00a34.25m gross fundraise completed in March 2025, TheraCryf has focussed its development strategy on delivering a new treatment for addiction, an Ox-1 blocker to the stage where the Ox-1 drug candidate can be administered to human volunteers. The Board believes that this focus will deliver the maximum return to shareholders given the potentially class-leading properties of our asset coupled with the significant commercial interest in the treatment of addiction that is currently underserved.\nAddictions cause significant morbidity and mortality, affecting hundreds of millions of people across the world. More people in the UK die from addictive disorders than in road traffic accidents2 and the cost burden to health services and the economy runs into many tens of billions. TheraCryf's rationale for focusing efforts on the addiction market is to reduce both the human and financial costs of these conditions, as well as generate value for shareholders on the basis of the potential size and growth of the market, and the potential value of out-licensing milestones and ongoing royalty payments, should a transaction be concluded with a large Pharma or large Biotech company.\nThe market for effective products to treat addiction stood at over $40bn in 2024 and is forecast to rise to $67bn4 by 2034. In this context, TheraCryf's analysis of recent out-license values of individual assets in brain disease when partnered with a large Pharma or large Biotech company showed up-front payments in the $26m-$49m range depending on stage of development. Total milestone payments, excluding royalties, during the life of a transaction (typically until end of patent life) were in the range of $409m to $570m. This analysis highlights the substantial financial opportunity within the brain disease therapy area, following successful late preclinical and early clinical development.\nProgress during the period towards our goal of reaching clinical trial readiness for the Ox-1 asset has been excellent.\nIn May 2025, TheraCryf appointed leading CRO/CDMO Pharmaron as development partner for its lead Ox-1 addiction programme, following a rigorous competitive tender process. Pharmaron is responsible for the manufacture of drug product for human use in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study. This process is conducted under special conditions, referred to as GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice), a regulatory standard to ensure safety and quality in order that the product can be given to humans. Data from this activity will form part of the regulatory package required for the clinical trial application. Manufacture is on track and in line with budget expectations with substantial progress made in scaling-up manufacture of the product to both 0.5kg and 10kg batches. Pharmaron is now starting the manufacture of human grade material.\nToxicology work for Ox-1 is also going to plan at Pharmaron. The second species for toxicology in vivo studies and a formulation suitable for administration to preclinical species and to humans have been selected. This work is on track for submission to the relevant regulatory authority to enable the start of clinical studies at the end of 2026.\nDuring the period, the TheraCryf team continued to highlight its work in this market segment via\npresentations and briefings to the pharma, scientific and shareholder communities, including a \"deep dive\" into the Ox-1 programme for investors in June 2025, which can be found\nHERE\n.\nPost period end, the first scaled up quantity of Ox-1 drug substance (0.5Kg) was delivered ahead of schedule in early November and manufacturing of human grade Ox-1 material for future use in clinical trials has commenced on schedule.\n4\nFuture Market Insights SUD Treatment Market Outlook June 2024\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP)\nWith the grant of a Korean patent during the period, the patent estate for the Ox-1 addiction programme is near to achieving global coverage. Patents for Ox-1 in the USA have been granted until 2039 and in European territories, including the UK, until 2038. Only one major territory remains to be added, where a submission has been made, and that grant is expected to be received in due course.\nLEGACY PROGRAMME\nSFX-01 in Glioblastoma, GBM\nGBM, the most severe form of the primary brain cancer glioma, has an incidence of 3.8 per 100,000 people. Prognosis with this severe form is poor with median survival of approximately 14 months and five-year survival of only around 5% of diagnosed patients. With treatment options limited to surgery followed by radiotherapy and only one drug approved for the condition, there is a very high need for novel treatments. Development of novel treatments has, however, proven challenging historically and therefore the Board has decided that the Company's primary focus of resources should be on the Ox-1 programme which is potentially lower risk with a significantly greater market opportunity.\nSFX-01 has already been awarded orphan drug status in this indication by the USA FDA and regulatory scientific advice received subsequently from the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board confirming there are no specific concerns regarding the clinical safety profile of SFX-01.\nDuring the period, collaborator Dr Marjolein Geurts, neuro-oncologist at the Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, NL continued to lead the SFX-01 GBM preclinical and clinical grant from\u00a0the Netherlands\u00a0government administered by the Dutch cancer society, KWF for a\u00a0\u20ac1.1m\u00a0total project value.\nThe next steps in this programme are to administer SFX-01 to preclinical models of GBM and, if successful to apply for permission to conduct a clinical trial in GBM patients.\nOUTLICENSING\nSTALICLA partnership\nIn October 2022, the Company licensed the global rights for legacy asset SFX-01 in neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia to STALICLA SA (Stalicla), a\u00a0Swiss company specialising in the identification of specific phenotypes of ASD, using its proprietary precision medicine platform.\u00a0The Company retains the global rights for all other indications.\nIn February 2024, TheraCryf gave a notice of dispute to Stalicla. The\u00a0TheraCryf board of directors believes that the Company has met the terms required to satisfy the $0.5m milestone payment due on completion of a Phase 1 clinical study, according to the License Agreement, and thus payment is due. In order to effect the payment, the Company has taken the decision to formally implement the dispute resolution process detailed in the License Agreement, the first step of which is the issuance of a dispute notice.\nAs stated previously, the Company has not included any milestone payments from Stalicla in its financial forecasting The Company continues to work on a way to resolve the current dispute.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe financial performance for the six-month period to 30 September 2025 was in line with expectations.\nOperating losses increased in the period by \u00a30.12m to \u00a31.37m compared with \u00a31.25m in the prior period\n. The use of cash predominantly reflects the commencement of the Ox-1 IND/CTA enabling work, while activities for SFX-01 programme spending remain mainly grant funded.\nThe integration of Chronos into the TheraCryf Group has been fully completed. Consequently, the total comprehensive loss for the period was \u00a31.31m (30 September 2024: \u00a31.25m).\nThe net cash outflow for the period was \u00a30.66m (30 September 2024: \u00a30.81m); the comparison with the prior period reflects working capital movements and the receipt of the R&D tax credit of \u00a30.39m (30 September: \u00a3nil).\nThe total cash position (including cash, cash deposits, short term investments and cash equivalents) as at 30 September 2025 was \u00a33.5m (30 September 2024: \u00a31.2m). The cash on deposits are held in a major bank in various fixed deposits account to maximise the return in interest. The longest fixed deposit account is a notice of 95 days.\nThe Directors estimate that the cash held by the Group will be sufficient to support the current level of activity to the end of 2026. They have therefore prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nOUTLOOK\nIn the last six months TheraCryf has made outstanding progress implementing its revised strategy to focus on progressing its lead Ox-1 addiction programme towards clinical readiness. With this focus, the opportunities for generating shareholder value have increased significantly. Active searches for funding of the other high value CNS programmes are underway and the Company will\nprovide updates as these come to fruition.\nThe next twelve months comprises several key preclinical development milestones including completion of large-\nscale manufacturing of drug substance for human trials, determination of maximum tolerated dose from toxicology studies and completion of all other regulatory activities to be clinic ready by the end of 2026. These milestones, and the ultimate goal of clinic readiness, represent significant value for shareholders driven by deal-making potential for the Company.\nThe Company's cash position remains healthy, especially in relative comparison to European peers, with a runway to the end of 2026, allowing the achievement of key milestones for the Ox-1 addiction programme and headroom to continue to progress the multiple opportunities for the expanded pipeline.\nThe Company's business model is to generate compelling data to support out-licensing of its preclinical and/or clinical assets with partners able to conduct later stage human trials and commercialise the resulting products.\nThe Board would like to thank all new and existing shareholders for their support and looks forward to progressing the Company's strategy which remains focused on its mission to reduce the human and financial cost of addiction and other neuropsychiatric conditions.\nDr Alastair Smith\nDr\nHuw Jones\nNon-Executive Chair\nCEO\n3 December 2025\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 -

GENERAL INFORMATION\nTHERACRYF PLC (\"TheraCryf\", \"the Group\" or \"the Company\") is a public limited company incorporated in England & Wales whose shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange under the symbol TCF.\nThe address of its registered office is Alderley Park, Congleton Road, Nether Alderley, SK10 4TG. The principal activity of the Group is clinical stage drug development.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of preparation\nThe Group's half-yearly financial information, which is unaudited, consolidates the results of TheraCryf plc and its subsidiaries undertaking up to 30 September 2025. The Group's accounting reference date is 31 March. TheraCryf plc's shares are quoted on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Company is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The consolidated financial information is presented in round thousands of Pounds Sterling (\u00a3'000).\nThe financial information contained in this half-yearly financial report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. It does not therefore include all of the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements. The financial information for the six months ended 30 September 2024 and 30 September 2025 is unaudited.\nFull audited financial statements of the Group in respect of the period ended 31 March 2025, which received an unqualified audit opinion and did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial information for the six months ended 30\u00a0September\u00a02025 are in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and are consistent with those which will be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2026.\nWhilst the financial information included has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of international accounting standards, the financial information does not contain sufficient information to comply with international accounting standards.\nThe Group has not applied IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, which is not mandatory for UK AIM listed Groups, in the preparation of this interim financial report.\nGoing concern\nAt 30 September 2025, the Group had cash, cash equivalents, cash on deposit and short term investments of \u00a33.5 million.\nThe Directors have prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows looking beyond 12 months from the date of the approval of these financial statements. In developing these forecasts, the Directors have made assumptions based upon their view of the current and future economic conditions that will prevail over the forecast period.\nThe Directors estimate that the cash and cash equivalents held by the Group together with known receivables will be sufficient to support the current level of activities into the end of calendar year 2026. They have therefore prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nSignificant management judgement in applying accounting policies and estimation uncertainty\nWhen preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial information, the Directors make a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions about the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\nThe following are significant management judgements and estimates in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most significant effect on the condensed consolidated interim financial information. Actual results may be substantially different.\nShare-based payments\nThe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of the options granted is determined using the Black Scholes model, taking into consideration the best estimate of the expected life of the options and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest.\nResearch and development expenditure\nAll research and development costs, whether funded by third parties under license and development agreements or not, are included within operating expenses and classified as such. Research and development costs relating to clinical trials are recognised over the period of the clinical trial based on information provided by clinical research organisations. All other expenditure on research and development is recognised as the work is completed.\nAll ongoing development expenditure is currently expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Due to the regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of the Group's programmes, the criteria for development costs to be recognised as an asset, as prescribed by IAS 38, 'Intangible assets', are not met until the product has been submitted for regulatory approval, such approval has been received and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group does not currently have any such internal development costs that qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets.\n3. LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the period attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nFor diluted loss per share, the loss for the period attributable to equity holders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. As the effect of the share options would be to reduce the loss per share, the diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share.\nThe calculation of the Group's basic and diluted loss per share is based on the following data:\nSix months ended\n30 September 2025\nSix months ended\n30 September 2024\nYear ended\n31\u00a0March 2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nLoss for the period attributable to equity holders\n(1,313)\n(1,245)\n(1,941)\nAs at\n30 September 2025\nAs at\n30 September 2024\nAs at\n31 March 2025\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\n2,145,687,341\n424,014,463\n538,311,037\nEffects of dilution:\nShare options\n-\n-\n21,982,557\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effects of dilution\n2,145,687,341\n424,014,463\n560,293,594\nPence\nPence\nPence\nLoss per share - basic and diluted\n(0.06)\n(0.29)\n(0.36)\n4. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nAs at the end of the period, the reconciliation of share option scheme movements is as follows:\nAs at 30 September 2025\nNumber\nWAEP\nOutstanding at 1 April 2025\n29,315,374\n0.0859\nGranted during the period\n289,820,873\n0.2500\nOutstanding at 30 September 2025\n319,136,247\n0.0079\nWAEP is an abbreviation for weighted average exercise price.\nDuring the six-month period ended 30 September 2025, a share-based payment charge of \u00a3102,206 (six months to 30 September 2024: \u00a321,092) was expensed to the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nThe fair values of the options granted have been calculated using a Black-Scholes model.\n5.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nOn 05 April 2024, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Chronos Therapeutics Limited for a total combined consideration of \u00a31,983k. Included within the total is cash consideration of \u00a384k, equity consideration of \u00a3899k and a contingent consideration of \u00a31,000k.\nChronos Therapeutics Limited holds a neuropsychiatry portfolio including two assets developed to late preclinical stage which widens the Group's pipeline. These assets comprise of an orexin-1 antagonist with potential utility in addition, impulsive behaviours and addiction and an atypical dopamine transporter inhibitor with potential utility in fatigue due to a number of conditions.\nThe Group has recognised contingent consideration liabilities at a value of \u00a31.0m on the acquisition of Chronos Therapeutics Limited. These liabilities are subject to certain conditional milestones being met, the additional payments could be a maximum of \u00a32.5m comprising of \u00a31.0m for the commencement of Phase 1 and \u00a31.5m upon completion of Phase 1. Given the current early stage of the development programme the Board have deemed it prudent to recognise contingent liability equivalent to 55.2% of the \u00a31.0m and 30% of the remaining \u00a31.5m. All additional consideration will be payable in shares.\nThe fair values of the identifiable net assets are set out below:\nBook Value\nFair Value Adjustments\nFair Value\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nIntangible assets\n504\n1,593\n2,097\nCash and cash equivalent\n9\n9\nTrade and other receivables\n12\n12\nTrade and other payables\n(135)\n(135)\nDeferred tax liability\n(398)\n(398)\nTotal identifiable assets\n390\n1,195\n1,585\nGoodwill\n398\nTotal consideration\n1,983\nSatisfied by:\nInitial cash consideration\n84\nInitial shares consideration\n899\nContingent consideration\n1,000\n1,983\nCashflow\nInitial cash consideration\n84\nCash acquired\n(9)\nNet cashflow impact of acquisition\n75\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The number of people affected is astonishing, with up to 2.2% of the global population estimated to have a Substance Use Disorder\n[1]\n. Current treatments often see high relapse rates, and there are limited long-term pharmacological options.\nLast year in the UK, addiction was the cause of more deaths than road traffic collisions, and it costs the economy more than \u00a321bn per year. Alcohol addiction alone costs the NHS more than \u00a33.5bn per year.\nTheraCryf is honoured to be contributing to the potential treatment of addiction with its lead Ox-1 orexin -1 blocker programme, targeting binge eating disorder and other substance use disorders.\nAs noted earlier this month, the programme is progressing on budget and ahead of schedule, with the\n0.5kg scale-up completed ahead of schedule, manufacturing of 2kg human grade material initiated and the scale-up to 10kg manufacturing proceeding to plan.\nThis is with our aim of achieving clinic readiness by the end of 2026.\nTheraCryf has also has robust patent protection for Ox-1, with the recent\npatent grant in Korea, complementing long lasting patent protection in all major territories including Europe and USA.\nDr Huw Jones, CEO of TheraCryf, said:\n\"\nIn marking Addiction Awareness Week, we are\nconscious of the very real unmet medical need in addiction. Addictive disorders affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families across the world, with the global cost burden running into many tens of billions. We are focused on helping to reduce both the human and financial costs of these conditions and getting our promising Ox-1 programme into the clinic as soon as possible.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nSinger Capital Markets (NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nPhil Davies /\nOliver Platts / Patrick Weaver\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nTurner Pope Investments (Joint Broker)\nJames Pope / Andy Thacker\n+44 (0)20 3657 0050\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris/ Melanie Toyne Sewell\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\ntheracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf plc\nTheraCryf is the clinical stage drug development company focussing on brain disorders.

Scale-up of the Ox-1 compound to 10kg has now been achieved on schedule and with a yield in excess of expectations.\nThis drug substance will be used in the 28-day regulatory toxicology studies scheduled to commence, in Q1 and Q2, this year in two species. These studies will provide essential data for the planned regulatory submission later in the year and represent the last major hurdle to achieving that goal.\nBefore starting the 28-day toxicology studies, the Maximum Tolerated Dose and Dose Range Finding studies need to be completed. This work has now started. These\nstudies will identify the 'therapeutic index' of the orexin-1 blocker - that is the range between which the dose is expected to have a therapeutic effect and the highest dose of compound reached before any harmful effects are observed.\nOx-1 is TheraCryf's lead asset, an orexin-1 blocker, being developed as\na potential treatment for addiction, blocks a pathway in the brain (orexin-1) known to be over-active in individuals with addiction. This group of conditions have significant human and economic impact globally. Blocking the overactivity of this pathway is known to reduce aberrant substance seeking behaviour in animal models. Drugs that can block this pathway have generated significant commercial interest and Theracryf's orexin-1 blocker is the most selective yet developed, indicating class leading potential.\nInvestor Webinar\nDr Huw Jones, Chief Executive Officer, and Dr Alastair Smith, Non-executive Chair, will be presenting a webinar hosted by TheraCryf's joint broker, Turner Pope Investments, at 6:00p.m. on Thursday, 8 January 2026.\nThe webinar will look at the progress made by TheraCryf in 2025 in driving its lead Ox-1 orexin blocker programme towards clinical trial readiness and also the potential milestones and value inflection points for TheraCryf coming up in 2026, including manufacturing scale-up as described above. A Q&A session will follow the main presentation.\nThe webinar is freely available for all existing and potential investors.

More than 80% of patients with multiple sclerosis suffer from fatigue and report it as the most common and debilitating symptom3. This overwhelming cognitive exhaustion, which is not simply being 'tired', severely impacts daily life. Currently there are no approved treatments for fatigue in these patients.\nThe potential market opportunity for treating chronic fatigue was estimated at US$1.2 billion in 2024 with the market expected to reach US$2.3 billion by 20331.\nGrowing scientific interest in the origins of mental fatigue is underscored by the recent\nNature\narticle2 by Lynne Peeples which highlights the research being undertaken to discover the roots of mental fatigue which could point to treatments for these debilitating disorders. Dopamine plays a major role in alertness and motivation with low levels being linked to fatigue states4.\nCurrent treatments include stimulants, such as amphetamines, which produce a rapid rise in dopamine, however, they are associated with significant side effects and a high potential for abuse because of the 'rush'-like feelings they produce.\nTheraCryf's DAT asset is differentiated by its ability to gradually increase levels of brain dopamine without the 'rush'-like profile, potentially providing a treatment that alleviates mental fatigue without abuse liability.\nElevating dopamine levels can also lead to increased wakefulness and the DAT asset has demonstrated positive preclinical proof of concept in connection with this, in models of drug-induced fatigue, MS fatigue and narcolepsy. The narcolepsy treatment market alone was valued at US$3.48 billion in 2024\u00a0and is expected to reach US$7.73 billion by 20325.\nDr Huw Jones, CEO of TheraCryf commented\n:\n\"Disease and treatment-related fatigue is a very serious issue for patients who are already severely affected by several underlying conditions. A therapeutic that could target these symptoms is clearly needed and the increase in research efforts and the associated market value related to fatigue make this a very attractive path to pursue.\n\"\nOur dopamine modulator is differentiated and highly selective, with strong potential in the large and growing area of central nervous system fatigue. While we progress our lead Ox-1 orexin blocker programme, we continue to explore the significant potential of the DAT programme for future development or licensing.\"\n-Ends-\n1.

The primary near-term value driver is a potential treatment for addiction; a market that already exceeds $40bn and is expected to grow substantially in the coming years to address the human and economic costs of a broad range of addictions from opioids, to alcohol, to food and binge eating.\n\"This treatment, which blocks a pathway in the brain that drives addictive behaviour, has the best pre-clinical\nperformance characteristics that I have seen. In addition, it has a short path to being ready to go into human trials next year - a major value inflection point which is certainly not reflected in the current valuation.\n\"I joined the board as Chair in February and, following a strategic review and a re-capitalisation of the company, the team has delivered strongly on the strategy to focus on our valuable CNS assets as the best route to delivering significant shareholder value.\n\"I anticipate multiple opportunities for strong news flow in Q1 and throughout 2026 as we drive towards the clinic and I look forward to working with the team to ensure the value of these important steps in the company's growth is communicated effectively.\"\nDr Huw Jones, Chief Executive Officer of TheraCryf, said:\n\"We have prioritised our addiction programme this year based on unmet medical need and potential market size, and a commitment to deliver value to shareholders. I am pleased that all activities leading to clinical readiness for ourOx-1 orexin blocker programme are progressing on or ahead of schedule, in line with our aim of achieving clinic readiness by the end of 2026.\n\"Addictions cause significant morbidity and mortality, affecting hundreds of millions of people across the world.

The number of people affected is astonishing, with up to 2.2% of the global population estimated to have a Substance Use Disorder\n[1]\n. Current treatments often see high relapse rates, and there are limited long-term pharmacological options.\nLast year in the UK, addiction was the cause of more deaths than road traffic collisions, and it costs the economy more than \u00a321bn per year. Alcohol addiction alone costs the NHS more than \u00a33.5bn per year.\nTheraCryf is honoured to be contributing to the potential treatment of addiction with its lead Ox-1 orexin -1 blocker programme, targeting binge eating disorder and other substance use disorders.\nAs noted earlier this month, the programme is progressing on budget and ahead of schedule, with the\n0.5kg scale-up completed ahead of schedule, manufacturing of 2kg human grade material initiated and the scale-up to 10kg manufacturing proceeding to plan.\nThis is with our aim of achieving clinic readiness by the end of 2026.\nTheraCryf has also has robust patent protection for Ox-1, with the recent\npatent grant in Korea, complementing long lasting patent protection in all major territories including Europe and USA.\nDr Huw Jones, CEO of TheraCryf, said:\n\"\nIn marking Addiction Awareness Week, we are\nconscious of the very real unmet medical need in addiction.

This milestone was reached ahead of schedule and with no issues. After formulation to the optimal dosage form, the compound will be used in an\nin vivo\nstudy to identify the 'therapeutic index': this is the range between which the dose is expected to have a therapeutic effect and the highest dose of compound reached before any harmful effects are observed. Data from this study will inform dosing in the key 28-day toxicology studies scheduled to commence in early 2026.\nThe 28-day toxicology studies will be supplied by the 10kg compound scale-up which is currently proceeding to plan and schedule.\nThe Company have also now initiated work through its partner, Pharmaron, to manufacture drug product for human use in the Ph1 healthy volunteer study. This process is conducted under special conditions, referred to as GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice), a regulatory standard to ensure safety and quality in order that the product can be given to people. Data from this activity will form part of the regulatory package required for the clinical trial application.\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO of TheraCryf commented\n:\n\"\nThe achievement of this first stage of compound scale-up is testament to the expertise and drive of the TheraCryf team and our colleagues at Pharmaron who continue to deliver excellent progress on our Orexin programme.\n\"We stated in our previous update that we would inform the market of this key milestone and it is very satisfying to be able to share that we got there ahead of schedule.\n\"\nWe anticipate updating the market over the coming weeks and months\u00a0on further substantial progress.\u00a0This will include completion of the 10kg manufacturing scale-up campaign, further\u00a0dose range finding studies to enable the initiation of the toxicology studies\u00a0and\u00a0the start and finish of the regulatory standard 28-day toxicology studies.\u00a0We will also provide updates on\u00a0the GMP manufacture of compound intended for human administration, along with our interactions with appropriate regulatory agencies in preparation for our clinical trial application.\n\"We remain confident that we are on target to achieve the data required to support a clinical trial submission for this exciting programme\u00a0according\u00a0to the plan we have outlined.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nSinger Capital Markets (NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nPhil Davies /\nOliver Platts / Patrick Weaver\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nTurner Pope Investments (Joint Broker)\nJames Pope / Andy Thacker\n+44 (0)20 3657 0050\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\ntheracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf plc\nTheraCryf is the clinical stage drug development company focussing on brain disorders.

This grant complements TheraCryf's already broad coverage across the major commercial markets including US, EU and other Asian territories. The patent cover for this programme is composition of matter (CoM), the strongest form of patent cover available.\nAdditionally, the Company is pleased to report on significant development progress on the Orexin programme. The manufacturing campaign continues on-track and to-plan to produce multi kilogram quantities. An optimal formulation of the lead compound has recently been identified and, based on new data, the non-rodent species has been selected for the 28-day toxicity studies that will commence in early 2026.\nFormulation\nA number of potential Amorphous Solid Dispersions (ASD) of the lead compound were screened\nin vitro\nand the optimal formulation taken forward into an\nin vivo\npharmacokinetics (PK) study. The chosen formulation has optimal features allowing for the utilisation of a straightforward drug-in-capsule drug delivery approach for first-in-human studies, and provides enhanced oral absorption and exposure, meaning less product will be required to achieve the blood levels needed for potential effectiveness.\nSecond preclinical species selection\nThe lead compound was tested\nin vivo\nin an alternative non-rodent species for the first time, where it exhibited highly favourable handling properties. This has enabled the confirmation of this species, which has comparability with human metabolism and is accepted by major regulatory agencies, for the 28-day repeated dose toxicity studies, data from which will form an essential element of the clinical trial application next year.\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO of TheraCryf commented\n:\n\"\nOur Intellectual Property cover for all major territories for our lead programme in addiction is very nearly complete. We are also pleased that the key pre-clinical activities needed in our Ox-1 development programme before first-in-human trials can be initiated are progressing on-time and to-plan.\n\"We now have a tractable formulation for both animal and human use and our second toxicology species, as required by regulatory authorities, has been confirmed by new data showing appropriate handling of our Ox-1 lead compound in blood following oral administration.\n\"\nWe anticipate updating the market over the coming weeks and months\u00a0on further substantial progress.\u00a0This will include completion of the 0.5 and 10kg scale manufacturing campaigns, further\u00a0dose range finding studies to enable the initiation of the toxicology studies\u00a0and\u00a0the start and finish of the regulatory standard 28-day toxicology studies.\u00a0We will also provide updates on\u00a0the manufacture of bulk and capsule material to a standard acceptable for human administration, along with our interactions with appropriate regulatory agencies in preparation for our clinical trial application.\n\"In short, with this substantial recent progress we remain confident that we are on target to achieve the data required to support a clinical trial submission for this exciting programme\u00a0according\u00a0to the plan we have outlined.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nSinger Capital Markets (NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nPhil Davies /\nOliver Platts / Patrick Weaver\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nTurner Pope Investments (Joint Broker)\nJames Pope / Andy Thacker\n+44 (0)20 3657 0050\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\ntheracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf plc\nTheraCryf is the clinical stage drug development company focussing on brain disorders.

Having appointed leading contract research and manufacturing organisation, Pharmaron UK, as partner, their team are currently working on optimising the synthesis of Ox-1 in order to scale up to produce the kilogram quantities required for regulatory standard toxicology work and later, clinical studies.\nThe Ox-1 molecule has been shown to be highly stable at room temperature.\nAn archive sample produced by Chronos Therapeutics Ltd in 2020, tested at Pharmaron, was found to have greater than 99% purity. This potential for long-term stability, which will be confirmed with additional stability testing of the newly produced material, will be an important factor in achieving optimal commercial potential.\nThe chemistry and biology work are progressing well with testing underway to understand further characteristics of Ox-1's synthesis and activity.\nAdditional\nin vitro\ntesting indicates that Ox-1 is well handled in cells from a new, fourth species, which will be essential to confirm its toxicology profile, a key enabling study before eventual permission to administer the agent to man.\nSFX-01\nThe company's legacy SFX-01 programme also continues to progress with the grant-funded Glioblastoma (GBM) project at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands confirming that drug from SFX-01 crosses the blood-brain barrier in\nin vivo\nexperiments, essential for GBM brain tumour treatment.\nAn academic collaboration in the USA on colorectal cancer has also reported data showing that Nrf2, a known molecular target, is\nup-regulated by SFX-01 only in diseased colon cancer models and not where the disease is absent.\nFurther, collaborating teams from Queen Mary University of London, Barts Hospital, Imperial College London, UCL, University of Oxford and University of Leicester have had a scientific paper on the effects of SFX-01 on another molecular target, SHP-2, accepted by a peer-reviewed journal which will be published imminently.\nDr Huw Jones, CEO of TheraCryf commented\n:\n\"We are pleased with how our Ox-1 programme is developing on-time and to-plan as we complete the final steps for readiness for human trials. Our commercial and academic collaborations are continuing to generate insightful data. We would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support as we unlock value from our assets.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\nDr Helen Kuhlman, CBO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nSinger Capital Markets (NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nPhil Davies /\nOliver Platts / Patrick Weaver\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nTurner Pope Investments (Joint Broker)\nJames Pope / Andy Thacker\n+44 (0)20 3657 0050\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\ntheracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf plc\nTheraCryf is the clinical stage drug development company focussing on brain disorders.

We have been struck by the high quality of our interactions so far and wish him a very warm welcome to the team. I look forward to working closely with Alastair.\"\nDr Alastair Smith, incoming Non-executive Chair of TheraCryf, added:\n\"TheraCryf's product portfolio includes assets addressing areas of high unmet need and, in particular, the Orexin-1 antagonist candidate has class leading characteristics and potential to treat patients with addictive disorders such as alcohol and opioid abuse, and binge eating disorder. This is a key time to be joining the business as it seeks to complete the final steps, over the next twelve months or so, to transition the Orexin-1 programme to clinical readiness - a huge value inflection point for the company.\n\"I look forward very much to supporting the team to deliver on the opportunities that clearly exist within the company and to communicate these opportunities effectively to the market so that progress is reflected by growth in shareholder value.\"\nThe following information is disclosed pursuant to Rule 17 and Schedule Two paragraph (g) of the AIM Rules for Companies in relation to Dr David Alastair Maclaughlin Smith, aged 58:\nCurrent Directorships/Partnerships\nPast Directorships/Partnerships (within 5 years)\nN4 Pharma plc\nSparta BioDiscovery Limited\nAvacta Group plc\nNextmune Laboratories Ltd (formerly Avacta Animal Health Ltd)\nAvacta Animal Health Inc.\nAvacta Analytical Limited\nAffimer Limited\nAvacta Ltd\nAvacta Life Sciences Limited\nAvacta Life Sciences Inc.\nAvacta Group Trustee Limited\nAvacta Finance (Jersey) Limited\nAffyXell Therapeutics\nCrossco (1127) Limited\nLaunch Diagnostics Holdings Limited\nLaunch Diagnostics Ltd\nCoris BioConcept SrL\nCoris Holdings SrL\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEOToni H\u00e4nninen, CFODr Helen Kuhlman, CBO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nCavendish Capital Markets (NOMAD and Broker)\nGeoff Nash / Teddy Whiley / Rory Sale (Corporate Finance)Nigel Birks /\nHarriet Ward\n(ECM)\n+\n44 (0)20 7220 0500\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris\n+44 (0)20 7390 0231theracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf plc\nTheraCryf is the clinical stage drug development company focussing on oncology and neuropsychiatry.

Planning for the atypical dopamine uptake inhibitor (DAT) and Orexin-1 antagonist programmes has also started in earnest.\n\"We saw further data generated on lead asset SFX-01 by collaborators on our grant funded GBM programme from the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam - triangulating data published by two other collaborators and further de-risking the programme, showing different cell lines and tissues all responding to SFX-01 in independent laboratories with varying methodologies. Data demonstrating SFX-01's effectiveness in radiosensitisation in rhabdomyosarcoma was also published in a prestigious cancer journal by our collaborators from University La Sapienza, Rome.\n\"Post period, data from our Phase 1b healthy volunteer PK study of SFX-01 was published in peer reviewed journal Advances in Therapy, showing the effectiveness of our new enteric coated tablet formation in proceeding beyond the acid environment of the stomach and releasing active drug where desired, in the small intestine. Concentrations of sulforaphane and metabolites were observed in the range where biological activity is seen in models of various diseases of interest.\"\n\"Recently we have had a notification from the European Patent Office of an intention to grant a composition of matter patent for our acquired OX-1 antagonist asset in December 2024. This complements patents already granted in territories such as the USA.\"\n\"In November, we were shocked and saddened at the sudden and unexpected death of our Chair Dr Sue Foden. Sue was highly supportive of management in the development and delivery of our plans and I re-iterate our deepest sympathies to her family and friends.\"\n\"Despite the recent sad news, we are better positioned than ever to execute on our business model to generate compelling data sets and commercialise our assets via accretive industry collaborations\n.\"\nDr\nHuw Jones, CEO, and Toni H\u00e4nninen, CFO will provide a live results presentation via the Investor Meet Company platform at 11am GMT on Thursday, 28 November 2024.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders and can be accessed via\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/\nEnquiries:\nTheraCryf PLC\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\n+44 1625 466591\nCave",

An imbalance in Orexin production and stimulation of the Orexin 1 receptor in the brain has been linked to anxiety, addiction and other mental health conditions. An Orexin 1 receptor antagonist inhibits the effect of Orexin on this receptor, potentially providing effective treatments for these disorders. TheraCryf's Ox-1 is the most selective Orexin 1 receptor antagonist thus far discovered and is currently at late pre-clinical stage.\nThis patent adds to TheraCryf's extensive international IP portfolio covering its oncology and neuropsychiatry products.\nDr Huw Jones, TheraCryf's CEO, commented:\n\"Composition of Matter patents such as this are the strongest form of intellectual property available. This decision will give extensive protection for our candidate Ox-1 receptor antagonist and associated novel molecular structures in the broad group of territories covered by the European Patent Office, complementing the patents in this family already awarded in the USA and Asia.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEOToni H\u00e4nninen, CFODr Helen Kuhlman, CBO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nCavendish Capital Markets (NOMAD and Broker)\nGeoff Nash / Teddy Whiley / Rory Sale (Corporate Finance)Nigel Birks /\nHarriet Ward\n(ECM)\n+\n44 (0)20 7220 0500\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris\n+44 (0)20 7390 0231theracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf plc\nTheraCryf is the clinical stage drug development company focussing on oncology and neuropsychiatry.

At the completion of the Acquisition, the Company agreed to adapt the legacy share option plan for each person holding options in Chronos, whereby Chronos option holders would surrender options held with Chronos and enter new option agreements with TheraCryf granting them Options in the Company.\nFurther, the Company stated in the final results for year to 31 March 2023 released on 28 May 2024, that all members of the management team had foregone opportunities for cash bonus payments to extend Company's cash runway as much as possible and had agreed to take Options in their place to an equivalent value.\nThe Options in lieu of cash bonus will vest on the 1 April 2025 and the Options for Chronos employees will vest immediately without any additional performance conditions attached, however the Chronos Option holders have agreed to a 18 month lock-in period for selling any shares following the acquisition of Chronos Therapeutics Ltd, which ends 05 October 2025.\nSurrender of existing Options\nThe Company's LTIP plan, as amended, has an aggregate maximum number of Options outstanding limited to 10% of the Company's issued share capital. To enable the issuance of the Options to key persons in Chronos and in order to issue Options in lieu of a cash bonus to key members of the Company's management as described above, it is a condition of the new Options that remaining rights over any existing options currently held are surrendered for no consideration (the \"Option Surrender\").\nThe Options previously granted had an exercise price of nil. The board believe it is appropriate to issue new Options to replace the existing ones to properly incentivise its employees, including its new employees and management. The new options have an exercise price of 0.25p.\nFollowing this award there are 29,895,081 options in issue, representing 7.0 per cent of the Company's issued share capital.\nDr Sue Foden, Chair of TheraCryf\nsaid:\n\"This revised incentive scheme provides greater alignment between Company management, former Chronos personnel deemed essential in development of the acquired Chronos Assets and our shareholders. I thank our management team for accepting share-based payments in lieu of cash bonuses in the interests of extending our cash runway and for voluntarily surrendering their options under previous schemes.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEOToni H\u00e4nninen, CFODr Helen Kuhlman, CBO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nCavendish Capital Markets (NOMAD and Broker)\nGeoff Nash / Teddy Whiley / Rory Sale (Corporate Finance)Nigel Birks /\u00a0Harriet Ward\u00a0(ECM)\n+\n44 20 7220 0500\nVigo Consulting\nRozi Morris\n+44 207 7390 0230theracryf@vigoconsulting.com\nAbout TheraCryf\nTheraCryf is a clinical stage drug development company focussing on oncology and neuropsychiatry.

The last couple of presentations have been good and whilst I was a little shocked by the fundraise and dilution at the time, given the state of funding for the sector at the moment and they way other companies are trickle feeding request for funding almost month by month or quarter be quarter at the moment in the hope that there will be a turnaround, I think TCF probably did the right thing. It potentially could be a long journey, but the new chair seems to know what he's doing, so for me, I'll top-up from time to time and average down when I can.",

The patent provides Composition of Matter, the strongest form of patent cover available, conferring long-term exclusivity and significantly strengthening the commercial and partnering proposition for the programme.\nThe Group also reports continued progress on\nits Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose Range Finding (DRF) studies, which commenced earlier this month. The MTD have now been successfully completed, with two species dosed up to the regulatory maximum, 1g/kg of the orexin-1 blocker, with no adverse clinical observations reported. This favourable outcome further de-risks the programme and enables progression into repeat-dose DRF studies, the results of which will inform the dosing for the planned 28-day regulatory toxicity studies scheduled in Q1 and Q2 2026, depending on species. This is a near final step on the path to IND/CTA readiness targeted for 2026.\nOx-1, TheraCryf's lead programme, is a novel, best-in-class orexin-1 blocker, being developed as\na potential treatment for addiction, including alcohol and other substance use disorders. The programme demonstrates class-leading selectivity and high receptor occupancy, characteristics which are expected to translate into improved tolerability and efficacy. Blocking the orexin-1 pathway has been shown to reduce aberrant substance-seeking behaviour in animal models, and the orexin pathway has attracted strong interest in the pharmaceutical sector.\nAddiction represents a large and growing global market, with substantial unmet medical need and significant human, social and economic impact, making it an attractive indication for development and commercialisation.\nDr Helen Kuhlman, Chief Operating Officer of TheraCryf, commented\n:\n\"Securing the Canadian patent completes coverage across all major commercial markets for our Ox-1 programme and strengthens its long-term value\n. Completion of our maximum tolerated dose studies further de-risks our best-in-class lead asset as we progress towards clinical readiness.\nWe remain well positioned to generate key value inflection data and advance Ox-1 towards partnering opportunities.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries\nTheraCryf plc\nDr Huw Jones, CEO\nToni H\u00e4nninen, CFO\nDr Helen Kuhlman, COO\n+44 (0)1625 315 090\nenquiries@theracryf.com\nSinger Capital Markets (NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nPhil Davies\n/ Patrick Weaver\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nTurner Pope Investments (Joint Broker)\nGuy McDougall / Andy Thacker\n+44 (0)20 3657 0050\nNorthstar Communications (Investor Relations)\nSarah Hollins\n+44 (0)113 730 3896\nsarah@northstarcommunications.co.uk\nAbout TheraCryf\nTheraCryf plc is a biotechnology company developing new medicines for addiction and other disorders of the brain, areas of significant unmet medical need within central nervous system (CNS) disorders.\nThe Group's lead programme is a novel, best-in-class orexin-1 receptor antagonist being developed as a potential treatment for addiction, including binge eating, alcohol and other substance use disorders. The programme is heavily de-risked, demonstrates superior selectivity and high receptor occupancy, and is fully funded through to clinical readiness, with regulatory submissions targeted for 2026.\nTheraCryf also has a dopamine transporter (DAT) modulator programme addressing fatigue of brain origin, including fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy and narcolepsy. The Group also has a legacy, grant-funded, oncology programme in glioblastoma with SFX-01.\nThe Group operates a capital-light, virtual development model\nadvancing programmes to early clinical or proof-of-concept stage before partnering with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.\nTheraCryf's headquarters and registered office are at Alderley Park, Cheshire.\nFor further information, visit:\nhttps://theracryf.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The last couple of presentations have been good and whilst I was a little shocked by the fundraise and dilution at the time, given the state of funding for the sector at the moment and they way other companies are trickle feeding request for funding almost month by month or quarter be quarter at the moment in the hope that there will be a turnaround, I think TCF probably did the right thing. It potentially could be a long journey, but the new chair seems to know what he's doing, so for me, I'll top-up from time to time and average down when I can.",

Unless that money they raised is for TCF but I doubt it. so...at least it tells us TCF's product was good. even if the buyer was a bit pants. anyway someone spent about \u00a310K on TCF stock today.",

The last couple of presentations have been good and whilst I was a little shocked by the fundraise and dilution at the time, given the state of funding for the sector at the moment and they way other companies are trickle feeding request for funding almost month by month or quarter be quarter at the moment in the hope that there will be a turnaround, I think TCF probably did the right thing. It potentially could be a long journey, but the new chair seems to know what he's doing, so for me, I'll top-up from time to time and average down when I can.",

Unless that money they raised is for TCF but I doubt it. so...at least it tells us TCF's product was good. even if the buyer was a bit pants. anyway someone spent about \u00a310K on TCF stock today.",

It potentially could be a long journey, but the new chair seems to know what he's doing, so for me, I'll top-up from time to time and average down when I can.",

It potentially could be a long journey, but the new chair seems to know what he's doing, so for me, I'll top-up from time to time and average down when I can.",
