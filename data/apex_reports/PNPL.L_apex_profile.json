Despite significant effort by both parties, Pineapple and Buffalo have mutually agreed to discontinue discussions on the proposed acquisition.\nAccordingly, Pineapple has applied to the FCA to lift the suspension of the Company's ordinary shares from the Official List and from trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (LON:LSEG). The Company anticipates trading will resume shortly.\nPineapple considered the proposed acquisition internally and as such no external due diligence costs have been incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition.\nClive de Larrabeiti, Corporate Finance Advisor to the Company stated - \"\nIt is regretful that the proposed amalgamation with Buffalo Battery Metals could not be completed despite the best efforts of both parties. However, the resumption of trading on the Main Market of the LSE will bring additional opportunities for the company and its shareholders as Pineapple is now one of very few available cash shells still listed on this market which enables an expeditious route to the international financial markets.\nI am pleased to report that the Company has, over the past month, received a number of enquiries from interested companies, which we are actively exploring and will update the market in due course.\n\"\nENQUIRIES\nFor further information, please visit -\nwww.pineapple-powercorp.com\n, or contact:\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\nClive de Larrabeiti\nCorporate Finance Advisor\nclive.d.l@pineapple-powercorp.com\n+44 203 039 3913\n+44 797 317 7973\nCorporate Broker\nPeterhouse Capital\nCharles Goodfellow\ncg@peterhousecap.com\n+44 207 220 9791\nMedia Relations\nDavid Burton\nTotal Market Solutions\ndavidburton.tms@gmail.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
