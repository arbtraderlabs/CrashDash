Despite significant effort by both parties, Pineapple and Buffalo have mutually agreed to discontinue discussions on the proposed acquisition.\nAccordingly, Pineapple has applied to the FCA to lift the suspension of the Company's ordinary shares from the Official List and from trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (LON:LSEG). The Company anticipates trading will resume shortly.\nPineapple considered the proposed acquisition internally and as such no external due diligence costs have been incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition.\nClive de Larrabeiti, Corporate Finance Advisor to the Company stated - \"\nIt is regretful that the proposed amalgamation with Buffalo Battery Metals could not be completed despite the best efforts of both parties. However, the resumption of trading on the Main Market of the LSE will bring additional opportunities for the company and its shareholders as Pineapple is now one of very few available cash shells still listed on this market which enables an expeditious route to the international financial markets.\nI am pleased to report that the Company has, over the past month, received a number of enquiries from interested companies, which we are actively exploring and will update the market in due course.\n\"\nENQUIRIES\nFor further information, please visit -\nwww.pineapple-powercorp.com\n, or contact:\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\nClive de Larrabeiti\nCorporate Finance Advisor\nclive.d.l@pineapple-powercorp.com\n+44 203 039 3913\n+44 797 317 7973\nCorporate Broker\nPeterhouse Capital\nCharles Goodfellow\ncg@peterhousecap.com\n+44 207 220 9791\nMedia Relations\nDavid Burton\nTotal Market Solutions\ndavidburton.tms@gmail.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

On publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\nMay 2, 2025\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC (the \"Company\" or \"Pineapple Power\")\nTermination of Proposed Acquisition of FUSE-AI Gmbh\nHeads of Terms signed for Proposed Reverse Takeover of\nBuffalo Battery Metals PTY LimitedContinuation of Suspension of Listing\nOn 23 December 2024 the Company announced that it had entered into non-binding heads of terms to acquire FUSE-AI Gmbh\u00a0(\"\nFUSE\n\"). Since that time, the Company has spent considerable time attempting to reach an acceptable agreement on the final structure of the transaction. To date, this has not been possible and the Company therefore announces that the proposed acquisition of FUSE has been terminated.\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has agreed in principle the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares in Buffalo Battery Metals PTY (Buffalo Battery Metals or\nBBM\n) in an all-share transaction, subject to legal, financial, technical and other due diligence and entry into a legally binding sale and purchase agreement (the \"\nProposed Acquisition\n\"). As no binding agreement has yet been reached, the Company cannot guarantee that the Proposed Acquisition will complete.\nAbout Buffalo Battery Metals PTY\nBuffalo Battery Metals is a privately owned Australian company focused on the exploration, development, and production of various minerals, including lithium, copper and gold, in Zimbabwe. Formed in 2022, BBM is a relatively new entrant into the African critical minerals sector. BBM provides investors with exposure to a high-growth region on the African Continent with significant untapped potential and is managed by a proven discovery and development team: BBM's management and technical team have a successful track record of bringing mineral projects from discovery through development and into production. BBM is focused on generating positive cash flow from its operations to minimise shareholder dilution with low capital cost and near term cash flow potential.\nThe Proposed Acquisition\nPineapple Power, as a listed shell, is well placed to facilitate the listing of Buffalo Battery Metals on the London Stock Exchange. As such, the Company and shareholders of BBM entered into non-binding heads of terms for the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of BBM by way of the allotment and issue of new ordinary shares in Pineapple Power. It is envisaged that, in conjunction with the Proposed Acquisition, there will be an equity financing to fund future investment and the working capital requirements of the enlarged group.\nOn completion of the Proposed Acquisition, it is the Company's intention is to delist its shares from the Official list and cease trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nDelisting\n\"), and to seek admission of its shares to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAdmission\n\").

On publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\n23 December 2024\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC (the \"Company\" or \"Pineapple Power\")\nTermination of Proposed Acquisition of Ilios Hydrogen Canada Limited\nHeads of Terms signed for Proposed Reverse Takeover of FUSE-AI GmbHContinuation of Suspension of Listing\nOn 6 November 2023 the Company announced that it had entered into non-binding heads of terms to acquire Ilios Hydrogen Canada Limited\u00a0(\"\nIlios\n\"). Since that time, both the Company and Ilios have spent considerable time attempting to raise the capital required for the transaction and to reach an acceptable agreement on valuation and the final structure of the transaction. To date, this has not been possible and the Company therefore announces that the proposed acquisition of Ilios has been terminated.\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has agreed in principle the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares in FUSE-AI GmbH (\"\nFUSE-AI\n\") in an all-share transaction, subject to legal, financial and other due diligence and entry into a legally binding sale and purchase agreement (the \"\nProposed Acquisition\n\"). As no binding agreement has yet been reached, the Company cannot guarantee that the Proposed Acquisition will complete.\nAbout FUSE-AI\nFUSE-AI is a Hamburg-based company specializing in the development of AI-powered software solutions for the clinical sector, which has established itself in recent years as an innovative company in the field of medical artificial intelligence.\nFUSE-AI has gained particular recognition with its AI software solution \u00abProstate.Carcinoma.ai\u00bb, which enables radiologists to save over 30% of time in MRI image analysis and reduces the error rate significantly from an average of 14% to 1%. The software is already ready for distribution in more than 42 countries, with recurring revenues being generated through distributors. This technology forms the foundation for further growth and the expansion into new application areas in diagnostic assistance software.\nFUSE-AI is backed by Xlife Sciences AG, a SIX listed incubator and accelerator focused on the value development and commercialization of promising research projects from universities and other research institutions in the life sciences sector.\nFurther information can be found here:\nhttps://fuse-ai.de/\nThe Proposed Acquisition\nXlife Sciences AG's announced on 21 November 2024 that FUSE-AI's shareholders had passed a unanimous resolution to list the FUSE-AI on the London Stock Exchange. The proposed listing is intended to support the further growth of FUSE-AI and the expansion into new application areas in diagnostic assistance software.\nPineapple Power, as a listed shell, is well placed to facilitate this listing. As such, the Company and shareholders of FUSE-AI, including Xlife Sciences AG entered into non-binding heads of terms for the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of FUSE-AI by way of the allotment and issue of new ordinary shares in Pineapple Power. It is envisaged that, in conjunction with the Proposed Acquisition, there will be an equity financing to fund future investment and the working capital requirements of the enlarged group.\nOn completion of the Proposed Acquisition, it is the Company's intention is to seek re-admission to trading on the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (\"\nFCA\n\") and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (together, \"\nAdmission\n\"). It is anticipated that, following completion of the Proposed Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nthe current directors of FUSE-AI will form a majority of the board of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe sellers of FUSE-AI will become majority shareholders of the enlarged Company.\nThe Proposed Acquisition is conditional on, amongst other things:\n\u00b7\nobtaining the necessary regulatory approvals of the FCA;\n\u00b7\nthe satisfactory completion, by each of the parties to the transaction, of legal, financial and commercial due diligence;\n\u00b7\nthe parties agreeing, signing and exchanging a legally binding share sale and purchase agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe admission of the enlarged share capital of the Company to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange;\n\u00b7\nthe raising of an appropriate amount of new equity funds by the Company;\n\u00b7\nthe Takeover Panel waiving any obligation the FUSE-AI sellers (and any persons acting in concert with them) might otherwise incur under Rule 9 of the City Code by virtue the issue to them of consideration shares (the \"\nRule 9 W",

The Company seeks to build and operate its production plants or alternatively may monetize the developed sites, producing significant near-term cash flows.

On publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC (the \"Company\" or \"Pineapple Power\")\nTermination of Proposed Reverse Takeover of Element 2 Limited\nUpdate on Suspension of Listing\nThe Company would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.\nTermination of Proposed Transaction\nOn 21 April 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a non-binding heads of terms with Element 2 Limited (\"\nE2\n\" or \"\nElement 2\n\"), based in Yorkshire, to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares in Element 2 in an all-share transaction, subject to legal, financial and other due diligence and entry into a legally binding sale and purchase agreement (the \"\nProposed Acquisition\n\").\nSince that time, both the Company and Element 2 have spent considerable time to raise the capital required for the transaction and reach an acceptable agreement on valuation and the final structure of the transaction. To date, this has not been possible and the Directors therefore announce that the Proposed Acquisition will not now proceed.\nStatus of Suspension of Trading\nDue to the size and nature of the Proposed Acquisition, it was treated as a reverse takeover (\"\nRTO\n\") for the purposes of the FCA's Listing Rules. As a consequence, the Company requested a suspension of trading in its ordinary shares while the details of the Proposed Acquisition were finalised and the required information is published or the Proposed Acquisition is terminated. Trading in the Company's shares was accordingly suspended on 24 April 2023 and has been suspended since that date.\nOrdinarily, on termination of such discussions, the Company would request that its ordinary shares be restored to listing. However, the Directors of the Company are actively considering another potential acquisition opportunity in the renewables sector which would constitute an RTO and have therefore requested that the Company's shares remain suspended for the time being.\nA further announcement will be made by the Company in due course.\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\nClaudio Morandi - Director\nClive de Larrabeiti\nCorporate Finance Advisor\nclive.d.l@pineapple-powercorp.com\n+44 203 039 3913\n+44 797 317 7973\nCorporate Broker\nPeterhouse Capital\nCharles Goodfellow\ncg@peterhousecap.com\n+44 207 220 9791\nMedia Relations\nDavid Burton\nTotal Market Solutions\ndavidburton.tms@gmail.com\nThis announcement is not intended to, and does not, constitute or form part of any offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of, or vote in any manner, any securities pursuant to this announcement or otherwise.

UPON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\n\u00a3350,000 Placing at 3p per share\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC (\"PNPL or the Company\") is pleased to announce that \u00a3350,000 of new financing has been secured for the Company by way of a fundraising undertaken by the Company's joint broker Peterhouse Capital Limited (\"Peterhouse\") at an issue price of 3p per share (the \"Placing Price\"). Andrew Holland (a director of the Company) and Peter Mills (a former director of the Company) participated in the fundraising.\nBackground\nThe Company is currently unable to issue and admit new shares without either the publication of an FCA approved prospectus or relying upon an exemption to the requirement to issue a prospectus. Consequentially, this fundraise involves a combination of a subscription by Claudio Morandi, a director of PNPL, for 10,966,666\nnew ordinary shares in the Company (the \"Director Shares\"), at a placing price of 3p each.\nFollowing Admission, Mr Morandi has agreed to sell the 10,966,666\nDirector Shares, at the same 3p consideration price, to certain investors introduced by Peterhouse and Andrew Holland, a director of the Company. In addition to the above, Peter Mills, a former director, is subscribing for 700,000 new ordinary shares at the Placing Price on his own account.\nPeterhouse is acting as placing agent to the Company. The Proceeds of the Placing, less expenses, will be utilised for general working capital requirements and to ensure the Company retains sufficient funds to meet the anticipated costs involved in any future acquisition.\nCompletion of the Placing is conditional on,\ninter alia\n:- the Placing Shares being admitted to listing on the Official List (standard listing segment) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities on or around 23 March 2023.\nApplications will be made to the FCA and to the London Stock Exchange for Admission in respect of the Placing Shares proposed to be issued on completion of the Placing. It is expected that Admission will become effective, and that dealings in the Placing Shares are expected to commence, at 8.00 a.m. on 23 March 2023.\nThe rights attaching to the Placing Shares will be uniform in all respects and all of the new Placing Shares will rank\npari passu\nand form a single class for all purposes with the existing issued shares of \u00a30.01 par value in the Company.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company has 83,332,877 ordinary shares of \u00a30.01 par value in issue, each with one vote per share (and none of which are held in treasury). The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore 83,332,877. This figure of 83,332,877 may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for calculations to determine if they have a notifiable interest in the share capital of the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, or if such interest has changed.\nFor further information please contact -\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\nClaudio Morandi - Director\nClive de Larrabeiti\nCorporate Finance Advisor\nclive.d.l@pineapple-powercorp.com\n+44 203 039 3913\n+44 797 317 7973\nJoint Corporate Broker\nPeterhouse Capital\nCharles Goodfellow\ncg@peterhousecap.com\nJoint Corporate Broker\nAxis Capital Markets\nRichard Hutchison\nrh@axcap247.com\n+44 207 220 9791\n+44\n203 026 0320\nMedia Relations\nDavid Burton\nTotal Market Solutions\ndavidburton.tms@gmail.com\nThis announcement is not intended to, and does not, constitute or form part of any offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of, or vote in any manner, any securities pursuant to this announcement or otherwise.

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Not for me personally but it is a stock I watch with interest as an observer of investor behaviour. ATB",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Not for me personally but it is a stock I watch with interest as an observer of investor behaviour. ATB",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m.

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

          "content": "Cash shell Pineapple Power Corporation (LON: PNPL) has found another potential reverse takeover candidate. Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",

Hamburg-based FUSE-AI develops medical artificial intelligence products. It has developed Prostate.Carcinoma.ai software that enables radiologists to save time analysing MRI images and reduces the error rate. Distributors are being signed up. FUSE-AI is an investee company of Xlife Sciences The deal to acquire Ilios Hydrogen is not going ahead. Raising the funding and coming to n agreement on valuation was not possible. Previously, the purchase of hydrogen refuelling business Element 2 at a valuation of \u00a3120m fell through in 2023. In the previous year, the proposed acquisition of Ireland-based green-focused fund manager BVP Investments, did not go ahead. FUSE-AI would be acquired in an all-share transaction. This is still subject to due diligence. A binding agreement has not been reached. The majority of the board will be from FUSE-AI. Pineapple Power Corporation floated on the standard list and the share price is 2.74p, although trading has been suspended since 24 April. The plan is to be readmitted to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) segment of the Official List. The company would have to be valued at a minimum of \u00a330m. Don\u2019t get to excited it will probably fall through again next year",
