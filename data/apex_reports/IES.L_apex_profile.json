He joins Invinity from U.S. energy storage business, Eos Energy Enterprises Inc., where he was Vice President, Strategic Corporate Accounts. Shane holds a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Biochemical Engineering from The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, as well as an MBA from the University of Miami.\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Shane enhances Invinity's global business development team with a primary focus on rapidly advancing the Company's commercial opportunities in the U.S. as well as globally. This senior hire represents a further advancement of Invinity's capabilities in the U.S., positioning the Company to capitalise on one of the world's largest and fastest growing markets for energy storage.\nInvinity continues to gain commercial traction within the U.S., driven by a growing number of operating projects across the country. Most recently, in late December 2025, Invinity announced a\n12 MWh order from Pacific Northwest National Labs (\"PNNL\")\nwhich followed a\nvisit from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright\n, who operated an existing Invinity battery system installed at PNNL's Grid Storage Launchpad facility. The Company also announced the successful commissioning of a number of key U.S. projects including the\n10 MWh vanadium flow battery system at the Viejas Resort and Casino\nand the\n4 MWh system for EDF Renewables North America subsidiary, Powerflex\n, both in Southern California.\nInvinity remains on track to establish a U.S. manufacturing facility later this year to complement its existing service facility in Vista, California. This U.S. manufacturing capability is being implemented in part to meet the domestic content and sourcing requirements required by customers who purchase Endurium for U.S. projects expecting to qualify for the enhanced Investment Tax Credit (\"ITC\"), while also allowing Invinity to benefit from manufacturing Production Tax Credits (\"PTC\"). Together, these benefits mean projects using Endurium can access materially improved project economics through higher after-tax returns, while our manufacturing operations benefit from predictable, long-term support for domestic clean-energy supply chains. Importantly, the facility is expected to be fully compliant with Foreign Entity of Concern (\"FEOC\") rules, giving customers, financiers and partners confidence that projects are insulated from regulatory risk and future policy tightening. Together, this delivers lower cost of ownership for customers, stronger bankability for projects, and a scalable, compliant platform for long-duration energy storage deployment across the U.S. market.\nFurther information on Invinity's activities in the U.S. can be found on the Company's\nwebsite\n.\nShane McBee, Vice President, Business Development at Invinity said:\n\"\nI am incredibly excited to join the Invinity team at this pivotal moment for the energy storage industry. Across the U.S., utilities, regulators and developers are moving quickly to secure reliable, high-throughput energy storage that can scale to support the rapid load growth seen particularly within the datacentre segment. The market is increasingly seeking an annuity versus a disposable asset - prioritizing proven technologies that deliver predictable performance and a 30+ year asset life without thermal runaway risk.\n\"I joined\nInvinity because I believe we are uniquely positioned to provide the mission-critical power infrastructure that not only hyperscalers, but the U.S. market as a whole require as we move into the next stage of the Age of Electrification\n\"\nMatt Harper, President at Invinity said:\n\"\nWe're\nabsolutely thrilled to welcome Shane to Invinity. His deep sector expertise and long track record in one of the world's fastest\u2011growing energy storage markets make him an exceptional addition to our team. The U.S. market represents a major growth trajectory for the Company, and Shane's leadership gives us a powerful platform to build on the strong network of projects and partners we've already established. As we move toward launching U.S. manufacturing, his arrival further strengthens the foundation for the next stage of Invinity's expansion.\n\"\nStay up to date with news from Invinity.

Invinity is also announcing today its biggest combined sales agreements to date for 2 Endurium systems totalling 20 MWh to Ideona, further details of which are set out below.\nThe Company has a substantial pipeline of opportunities which it is progressing and has growing confidence that this pipeline will ultimately be converted into material sales orders in due course, particularly given the momentum shown recently from the 4 agreements announced over the last 7 business days. In addition, the Company continues to work with its potential customers on the 16.7 GWh of bids submitted under the UK Long Duration Energy Storage (\"LDES\") Cap & Floor Scheme, further details of which are given below.\nThe above commercial progress has been made possible by the product cost reduction activities that have, and continue to be, engaged in and are progressing ahead of targets. This, together with the expansion of the product range announced in September 2025 with the launch of Endurium Enterprise primarily aimed at the Commercial & Industrial 'behind-the-meter' market, is enabling Invinity to provide a competitive product offering to its customers and which, the Board believe, will enable Invinity to expand its market share and cement its position as one of the leading\nglobal manufacturers of utility-grade long duration energy storage.\nOperationally, Invinity is pleased to announce that deliveries to major projects expected for completion within 2025 have been successfully concluded. This includes deliveries to\nHITT, STS\nand the 2 VS3 sales to\nIdeona\nas well as the Invinity Copwood VFB Energy Hub, which is progressing very well and expected to be fully operational within H1 2026. The Company is very pleased to have engaged with partner Enel X to manage dispatch and revenue optimisation from the Invinity Copwood VFB Energy Hub, which once operational will generate recurring revenue for the Company.\nA feature of Invinity's operational capabilities is the flexibility of its manufacturing approach. Stack manufacturing capacity was significantly increased through the implementation of a semi-automated stack line in Scotland, which can be readily replicated in other jurisdictions for relatively low capital expenditure, and during the year the transfer has been completed of Endurium initial balance of system manufacturing to its partner in China, Baojia. Invinity is now able to ship Endurium direct from the UK, Canada and China and is primed to scale up such capacity across those locations as well as the U.S. and in India supported by its recently announced partnership with Atri.\nThe Company is pleased to confirm that it has recently concluded the commissioning of its\n10 MWh project with partner Indian Energy\nat the Viejas Resort and Casino in Southern California, as well as its\n4 MWh project with EDF Renewables North America subsidiary PowerFlex\non the tribal lands of the Rincon Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians, also in Southern California. At the Rincon project all the Invinity vanadium flow batteries (\"VFBs\") have now been installed, with commissioning expected in January 2026.\nIn terms of performance for 2025, on 9 September the Company confirmed, inter alia, that it had approximately \u00a315m of signed committed or booked revenue and grant income where Invinity had a high confidence, albeit with risks remaining relating to supply chain execution impacting delivery by year-end. It also stated that it had approximately \u00a35m signed uncommitted with projects where the key risks include delay to customer Notice to Proceed (\"NTP\") and approximately \u00a36m near-term contracts. The amount of such revenue to be recognised would depend on concluding certain near-term commercial opportunities and the successful shipment of those together with the completion of shipment of existing signed orders.\nThe Company can confirm today that it anticipates recording revenue and project grant income for 2025 of approximately \u00a317m following the shipment of products to STS, Ideona and HITT as well as claiming the majority of the grant funding available for the Invinity Copwood VFB Energy Hub. This does not include any licence fee income from the agreement with UESNT which had not yet been concluded by, despite negotiations running up to, the year-end; however, Invinity will work with UESNT to progress their project into 2026.\nAt today's date, the Company has a 2026 order book of \u00a317m signed contracts/sales agreements comprising the following:\n\u00b7\nApproximately \u00a38m signed committed.\n\u00b7\nApproximately \u00a39m signed uncommitted. These are projects where the key risks include delay to customer NTP, typically impacted by construction permits, site readiness and the timing of financial close. This number does not include any licence fee which would be payable by UESNT if their project progresses.\nThis order book, which matches the same revenue and project grant income expected to be recorded for all of 2025, represents a meaningful portion of anticipated 2026 revenues which, together with the substantial pipeline of potential order for 2026 and beyond, gives significant confidence in the future prospects for the Company.\nFollow-On Sales to Hungarian Partner\nAs indicated above, the Company has signed two new agreements to supply 20 MWh of vanadium flow battery systems to Central European Vanadium Storage Kft, a subsidiary of diversified energy project, property and capital management firm\nIdeona\n, one of Invinity's commercial partners in Hungary, for use in two solar-plus-storage projects in Hungary.\nThese deals would represent Invinity's fourth and fifth sales into the Hungarian market, and are repeat orders from Ideona, which previously purchased a\n4 MWh VS3 battery system in September 2025\nand were part of a consortium which\npurchased a 1.5 MWh VS3 in 2023\n.\nOf the 20 MWh, an 8 MWh Endurium VFB will be located in Veszk\u00e9ny, western Hungary, while a 12 MWh Endurium VFB will be located in Dunaf\u00f6ldv\u00e1r, central Hungary. Both projects will be co-located with existing solar photovoltaic arrays and will use Invinity's batteries to provide energy shifting and regulation services to their local grids. These projects are to be supported in part by funding from the Hungarian government.\nAs with previous sales with Ideona, both agreements are conditional on NTP being received by Invinity, which the Company has been advised to expect in H1 2026 once Ideona and their funding partners have reached financial close on each project. Assuming the NTPs are received in line with this schedule, deliveries of Endurium batteries for both projects are expected to commence in H1 2026.\nCap and Floor Programme Continues to Progress\nFinally, Invinity has continued to work with its partners within the UK LDES Cap and Floor programme to advance those applications for delivery to 21 projects across the UK, which together could see\nthe deployment of up to 16.7 GWh of Invinity's VFBs\n. Efforts by Invinity and its partners within Q4 2025 have included finalising submissions to programme administrator\nOfgem\ndetailing the cost-benefit analysis of these projects, confirming how these projects will benefit not just the operation of the UK grid but also the costs passed on to electricity consumers.\nThe Company cautions that due to the competitive nature of the Ofgem process, there is no guarantee any, and highly unlikely that all, of these project bids will ultimately be successful. However, Invinity's management team continue to believe that the Company is well positioned to secure a level of orders which could be highly material to Invinity's future trading.\nThe Company expects to provide an update once further announcements on the scheme are made by Ofgem, for which Ofgem has guided towards a final determination in summer 2026.\nJonathan Marren, Chief Executive Officer at Invinity said:\n\"2025 has been a year of meaningful progress for Invinity. We entered the year having just launched Endurium and with a clear focus on reducing product costs while expanding our addressable market, and I am pleased with the substantial advances we have made commercially, operationally and in product competitiveness. The momentum demonstrated by multiple sales announced in recent weeks, repeat orders from established partners such as Ideona, and the build-up of a \u00a317m 2026 order book gives the Board growing confidence in the Company's outlook. With a scalable manufacturing footprint, an expanded product range and a strong pipeline across utility-scale and behind-the-meter markets, we believe Invinity is well positioned to drive further growth and strengthen its position as a global leader in long-duration energy storage.\n\"These follow-on agreements with Ideona are a strong endorsement of both our technology and our execution. Signing repeat agreements which will represent our largest combined sales to date with a trusted European partner reflects the growing role that long-duration energy storage is playing in solar-plus-storage projects across Central Europe. We look forward to supporting Ideona as these projects progress to financial close and into delivery during 2026, and to further expanding our partnership as the market for grid-scale long duration energy storage continues to develop.\"\nStay up to date with news from Invinity.

Chosen for its safety and durability characteristics, Invinity's battery system will enable the facility to maximise its use of self-generated solar power, improve resilience and perform other services such as peak load management as required. The installation of vanadium flow batteries is expected to deliver a significant reduction in energy costs for the site whilst improving resiliency and enabling the facility to operate with a reduced carbon footprint, supporting their commitment to environmental and ecological responsibility.\nEndurium Enterprise is the latest addition to Invinity's product line and is specifically designed for commercial and industrial (\"C&I\") businesses looking to deploy proven, safe and cost-effective on-site energy storage to deliver low-cost, low-carbon electricity on demand.\nCommencement of the project remains subject to the receipt of relevant construction permits, which are expected to be received soon, with delivery of the batteries therefore expected during H2 2026.\nJonathan Marren, Chief Executive Officer at Invinity said:\n\"We launched Endurium Enterprise in September this year and this announcement marks our first such sale. Endurium Enterprise is designed for\nC&I businesses often using the system \"behind-the-meter\" and the use case by Charles Murgat is exactly the sort that we envisaged.\n\"The efforts during 2025 by Invinity to reduce the product cost of Endurium are now starting to be rewarded. This sale, which is not reliant on subsidy or grant funding but is justified on a purely commercial basis, is an incredibly exciting milestone and provides an excellent reference case for other businesses looking to reduce their energy supply costs by deploying our vanadium flow batteries.\n\"Our Enterprise product delivers low-cost, low-carbon energy on demand for C&I customers who look for market-leading safety, sustainability and durability from their energy storage solution. We're looking forward to delivering this project and many more like it in the future.\"\nStay up to date with news from Invinity.
