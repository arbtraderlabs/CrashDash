The changes reflect the Company's growing scale and maturity as a public company and align B90 with best practice corporate governance standards, providing clearer distinction between independent Board oversight and executive management.\nAndy has been a Non-Executive Director of B90 since August 2023, where he has served as Chair of the Audit Committee, and brings extensive experience of digital gaming and public markets. This includes having been Non-Executive Chairman of leading Italian gambling company Planet Win/SKS365 Malta Ltd, CEO of Jackpotjoy plc, one of the world's largest online bingo operators, and CEO of leading online gambling company Sportingbet plc.\nMartin Fleisje, independent Non-Executive Director, will assume the role of Chair of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will comprise Martin Fleisje (Chair) and Andy McIver.\nRonny Breivik, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"As B90 continues to scale and mature as a public company, it is right that our governance structures evolve alongside it. Separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides greater clarity and focus across the Group and reflects both the progress we have made and our ambitions for the future.\n\"I am delighted that Andy will assume the role of Chairman, bringing deep sector experience and strong governance insight, while I continue to focus fully on executing our strategy and driving long-term value for shareholders.\"\nAndy McIver, Non-Executive Chairman, added:\n\"Having worked closely with the Board as a Non-Executive Director, I am pleased to assume the role of Chairman at this important stage in B90's development. The Company has built a scalable, technology-led platform with a clear strategic focus and strong operational discipline. I look forward to working closely with Ronny and the executive team as B90 continues to execute its growth strategy.\"\n-ends-\nFor further information please visit\nwww.b90holdings.com\nor contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Chief Executive OfficerMarcel Noordeloos, Chief Financial Officer\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nRosewood (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Subject to the completion of the audit process, EBITDA is expected to be in line with market expectations, reflecting higher marketing spend, primarily driven by increased competition and rising costs across Google-led acquisition channels.\nOperational Highlights\nB90 has further embedded automation, AI and machine-learning tools across its marketing and operational infrastructure, enabling the Group to scale activity without a commensurate increase in overheads. This continued evolution of the operating model is enhancing campaign efficiency, improving partner returns and supporting margin progression.\nThe Group's pay-per-click operations, underpinned by experienced in-house teams and data-driven optimisation, delivered a growing volume of high-quality leads and first-time depositing customers (\"FTDs\") to an expanding base of B2B partners.\nIncreased automation has improved targeting, campaign optimisation and real-time decision-making, while maintaining tight control over customer acquisition costs.\nOperational cash generation remained a key focus during the period, with marketing investment funded from cash generated from operations. This disciplined approach has enabled the Group to reinvest selectively behind its strongest-performing activities while maintaining control of the overall cost base.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, 2026 is expected to follow a similar strategic trajectory, with an increased emphasis on automation, AI-driven optimisation and scalable growth. The Group believes its technology-led model is well positioned to benefit from major global sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup in 2026, which historically drive increased customer acquisition activity and first-time depositor volumes across the sector.\nRonny Breivik, Executive Chairman of B90 Holdings plc, commented:\n\"Looking ahead, our priorities are clear. We will continue to scale our core pay-per-click and owned-media operations, while increasing automation across the business to drive growth without incremental cost inflation. We will invest selectively in marketing where returns are demonstrable and cash generative, deepen and strengthen our partner network, and remain highly disciplined in our approach to cash management and operational execution.\n\"We are confident that this focus will support continued growth, improving operating leverage and enabling the Group to deliver another year of material revenue and EBITDA growth.\"\n- Ends -\nThe information communicated in this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\u00a0as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.b90holdings.com\nor contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Executive ChairmanMarcel Noordeloos, Finance Director\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nRosewood (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Our lean operating model, supported by automation and AI, continues to deliver real value to partners while keeping our infrastructure agile and efficient.\n\"We enter the second half of 2025 with strong momentum, benefiting from a strong trading period and a growing portfolio of high-quality partnerships.

Having completed the operational turnaround in 2024, we have now entered a period of accelerated, technology-driven growth underpinned by our lean, B2B-focused model. The benefits of this transition are evident in our financial and operational performance for the period, with management focused on increasing revenue and EBITDA. H1 2025 resulted in revenue increasing by 75% and EBITDA reaching \u20ac0.30 million (compared to \u20ac0.18 million in H1 2024).\nWe are no longer a turnaround story. We are now a scalable B2B marketing platform focused on performance, efficiency, and innovation. Our technology-led customer acquisition capabilities, enhanced partner base, and expanding geographic reach position us to deliver continued growth and long-term value creation.\nOperational Review\nDuring H1 2025, we made strong progress across the business, with revenue rising to \u20ac2.41 million (H1 2024: \u20ac1.38 million) and increasing EBITDA to \u20ac0.30 million (H1 2024: \u20ac0.18 million). Growth was driven by increased volumes from existing partners and the onboarding of new B2B relationships. Our scalable pay-per-click engine continues to deliver high-quality leads and first-time depositing customers, through more than 200 partners. These results reflect a disciplined focus on performance marketing, cost control, and operational leverage.\nAt the heart of our growth is a high-performing marketing platform underpinned by automation and AI. The now-completed turnaround has streamlined our cost base, enabling us to focus entirely on lead generation and value delivery. Brand performance remains strong: Oddsen.nu's international expansion is unlocking new revenue opportunities, with long-term agreements contributing materially. Bet90.com, relaunched as an affiliate platform, is also generating encouraging early traction.\nThis momentum is the result of deliberate planning and focused execution. We have been selective in the markets we serve and the partners we engage, prioritising sustainable growth over scale for its own sake. That discipline is supported by a lean, experienced core team whose sector knowledge and agility are central to our performance.\nOur relationships with partners are built on trust, responsiveness, and data-driven execution. We tailor acquisition strategies by season, vertical and geography, and continually optimise campaigns based on close collaboration and shared insight.\nTechnology and Innovation\nTechnology is embedded in every layer of our operations and is central to how we scale. We continue to invest in tools and platforms that enhance campaign efficiency, optimise traffic monetisation, and support real-time decision making. AI-driven targeting and automation are enabling us to generate high-quality leads at lower marginal cost, improving returns for our partners without requiring proportional increases in headcount or spend.\nAI is now integrated across almost every aspect of the business, from traffic routing and campaign analytics to market research and partner optimisation. The use of generative and predictive tools allows us to process and interpret large volumes of data in minutes, replacing what previously required multiple teams and significant time. The power of these technologies lies not just in the tools themselves, but in how we deploy them using our deep sector knowledge and operational experience.\nIn parallel, we are diversifying our marketing channel mix by exploring new channels and geographies, laying the groundwork for continued organic growth. Our scalable architecture, combined with a clear understanding of affiliate marketing dynamics, gives us a competitive advantage that is both defensible and adaptable.\nBy embedding automation and AI into our daily operations, we are able to stay lean, agile and highly focused. This is a model that continues to deliver both performance and efficiency as we scale across multiple platforms and markets.\nCorporate Review\nIn June 2025, we implemented an enhanced long-term incentive plan, granting 22 million options to directors and key staff. This aligns performance with shareholder value creation and incentivises sustained delivery over the medium term. In the same month, our Non-Executive Director Andrew McIver increased his equity holding, which is another clear demonstration of Board-level confidence in our strategy and outlook.\nWe continue to operate with a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We are selective about the events we attend, the channels we invest in, and the partnerships we pursue. By focusing on activity that builds long-term value rather than short-term visibility.\nFinancial Review\nThe Group delivered revenues of \u20ac2.41 million in H1 2025, up from \u20ac1.38 million in H1 2024, a 75% increase.\nEBITDA for the period was \u20ac0.30 million, up from \u20ac0.18 million in the prior period, while the net loss narrowed significantly to \u20ac0.04 million (H1 2024: loss of \u20ac0.32 million), after accounting for ongoing amortisation and share-based payment expenses.\nOperating expenses were held broadly flat despite the significant growth in revenue, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of our operating model. Cash at the period end stood at \u20ac0.40 million, with a modest net current asset position.\nWhile we continue to monitor liquidity closely, our financial position reflects a healthy and improving profile driven by profitability, rather than external capital. We remain confident in our ability to fund future growth through operational cash flow.\nUnaudited\nFirst 6 months of 2025\nUnaudited\nFirst 6 months of 2024\nAudited\nFull year\n2024\nNet loss\n(39,223)\n(321,954)\n(1,701,414)\nAmortisation & Depreciation\n282,102\n381,966\n763,932\nImpairments\n-\n-\n1,398,107\nShare based payments\n66,336\n130,975\n219,769\nTax\n(6,499)\n(7,583)\n(14,083)\nEBITDA\n302,716\n183,404\n666,311\nOutlook and Current Trading\nB90 enters the second half of 2025 in its strongest position to date. We have a lean, scalable, and profitable business model; a growing and diversified network of global partners; and a highly focused team aligned around performance and growth. With market expectations reaffirmed in our July 2025 trading update, we remain confident in delivering a strong full-year result at both revenue and EBITDA level.\nOur priorities for the remainder of the year include expanding revenue from existing marketing assets, securing additional high-margin partnerships, unlocking new geographies, and continuing to invest in performance-driven technology. The second half of the year traditionally benefits from peak activity in both sports and casino, trends already reflected in current trading, giving us additional confidence in our outlook.\nJuly and August 2025 delivered record-breaking monthly revenues for the Group and a corresponding strong EBITDA performance, underlining the strength of our model and the momentum with which we enter the remainder of the year.\nWe remain focused on driving profitable growth, strengthening partner relationships, and creating sustained value for shareholders.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our shareholders, partners, and team for their continued support. We move forward with confidence, momentum, and a clear strategy for long-term success.\nRonny Breivik\nExecutive Chairman22 September 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nUNAUDITED\nPeriod ended\nUNAUDITED\nPeriod ended\nAUDITED\nYear ended\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nRevenue\n2,407,483\n1,379,178\n3,521,834\nMarketing and selling expense\n(986,287)\n(181,370)\n(753,064)\nSalary expense\n(816,368)\n(841,940)\n(1,591,191)\nOther administrative expense\n(368,448)\n(303,439)\n(731,037)\nAmortisation and impairment expense\n(282,102)\n(381,966)\n(2,162,039)\nTotal administrative expenses\n(2,453,205)\n(1,708,715)\n(5,237,331)\nOperating loss\n(45,722)\n(329,537)\n(1,715,497)\nTaxation\n6,499\n7,583\n14,083\nLoss for the period\n(39,223)\n(321,954)\n(1,701,414)\nLoss per share attributable to equity holders of the Company\n- Basic (in \u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0164)\n- Diluted (in \u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0164)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nUNAUDITED\nUNAUDITED\nAUDITED\nYear ended\n6 months ended\nYear ended\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nNon-current assets\nGoodwill\n1,913,600\n1,913,600\n1,913,600\nOther intangible assets\n4,880,248\n6,942,423\n5,162,350\nTotal non-current assets\n6,793,848\n8,856,023\n7,075,950\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n1,010,011\n503,553\n704,374\nCash and cash equivalents\n401,206\n302,104\n364,259\nTotal current assets\n1,411,217\n805,657\n1,068,633\nTotal assets\n8,205,065\n9,661,680\n8,144,583\nEquity and liabilities\nShare capital\n-\n-\n-\nAdditional paid-in capital\n41,170,466\n41,110,393\n41,170,466\nReverse asset acquisition reserve\n(6,046,908)\n(6,046,908)\n(6,046,908)\nRetained earnings\n(28,480,624)\n(27,217,071)\n(28,507,737)\nTotal shareholders' equity\n6,642,934\n7,846,414\n6,615,821\nNon-current liabilities\nDeferred tax liability\n213,345\n226,345\n219,845\nTotal non-current liabilities\n213,345\n226,345\n219,845\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n1,348,786\n1,588,921\n1,308,917\nTotal current liabilities\n1,348,786\n1,588,921\n1,308,917\nTotal equity and liabilities\n8,205,065\n9,661,680\n8,144,583\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nAdditional\nOther reserves -\nShare\npaid in\nReverse asset\nRetained\ncapital\ncapital\nacquisition reserve\nearnings\nTotal\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nBalance as at 1 January 2024\n-\n41,110,393\n(6,046,908)\n(27,026,092)\n8,037,393\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(321,954)\n(321,954)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n130,975\n130,975\nBalance as at 30 June 2024\n-\n41,110,393\n(6,046,908)\n(27,217,071)\n7,846,414\nBalance as at 1 January 2024\n-\n41,110,393\n(6,046,908)\n(27,026,092)\n8,037,393\nResult for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(1,701,414)\n(1,701,414)\nConversion of liabilities\n-\n45,000\n-\n-\n45,000\nExercise of stock options\n-\n15,073\n-\n-\n15,073\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n219,769\n219,769\nBalance as at 31 December 2024\n-\n41,170,466\n(6,046,908)\n(28,507,737)\n6,615,821\nResult for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(39,223)\n(39,223)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n66,336\n66,336\nBalance as at 30 June 2025\n-\n41,170,466\n(6,046,908)\n(28,480,624)\n6,642,934\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash flows from operating activities\nOperating loss\n(45,722)\n(329,537)\n(1,715,497)\nAdjustments for:\nShare based payments\n66,336\n130,975\n219,769\nImpairments of intangible assets\n-\n-\n1,398,107\nAmortisation of intangibles\n282,102\n381,966\n763,932\nCash flow generated from operations before working capital changes\n302,716\n183,404\n666,311\n(Increase) in trade and other receivables\n(305,638)\n(15,568)\n(216,389)\nIncrease/(decrease) in trade and other payables\n39,870\n(694,847)\n(929,851)\nCash flow used in operations\n36,948\n(527,011)\n(479,929)\nTax (paid)/received\n-\n-\n-\nCash flow used in operating activities\n36,948\n(527,011)\n(479,929)\nCash flow from financing activities\nProceeds of issue of new shares\n-\n-\n15,073\nNet cash inflow used in financing activities\n-\n-\n15,073\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n36,948\n(527,011)\n(464,856)\nCash and cash equivalents at start of period\n364,259\n829,115\n829,115\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n401,207\n302,104\n364,259\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n1. Basis of preparation\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of B90 Holdings plc (the \"Company\") and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) (collectively the \"Group\").\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited, do not constitute statutory accounts and were approved by the Board of Directors on 19 September 2025.\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nIn preparing the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024. The year ended 31 December 2024 Annual Report and financial statements is available on the Company's website (www.b90holdings.com).\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial information in this report has been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. IFRS is subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee and there is an ongoing process of review and endorsement by the European Commission. These policies are consistent with those to be adopted in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2025.\nThe Group has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Statements\" in preparing the interim financial information.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties of the Group have not changed since the last annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, where a detailed explanation of such risks and uncertainties can be found.\nGoing concern\nThe Group reported a net loss of \u20ac0.04 million for the six months ended 30 June 2025, with a positive EBITDA of \u20ac0.30 million. The Group reported a positive cash flow from operations of \u20ac0.04 million.\nTrading during H1 2025 was in line with the Board's expectations and shows further improvement from 2024. The Group also shows a positive working capital position of \u20ac0.06 million. The Directors believe the Group will meet the full year expectations. However, should revenue not be in line with management's expectations going forward, the Group's ability to meet its liabilities may be impacted, in which case the Group may need to raise further funding. In the event that further funds are needed, whilst the directors are confident of being able to raise such funding if required, there is no certainty that such funding will be available and/or the terms of such funding. These conditions are necessarily considered to represent a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWhilst acknowledging this uncertainty, the Directors remain confident that the current strategy will allow the Group to expand its operations and generate a positive operational cash flow within a reasonable time or, if needed, be able to raise additional funding when required; therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis. These financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\n2. Earnings per share\nThe calculation of earnings per share is based on the following earnings and number of shares.\n6 months\nended\n30 June 2025\n6 months\nended30 June 2024\nYear ended31 December 2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nEarnings\nLoss for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per shares being net result attributable to equity shareholders\n(39,223)\n(321,954)\n(1,715,497)\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share\n440,814,739\n439,518,227\n439,782,993\nWeighted average number of dilutive share options\n-\n-\n-\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share\n440,814,739\n439,518,227\n439,782,993\nBasic loss per share (\u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0039)\nDiluted loss per share (\u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0039)\n3.

These options have an exercise price of 3p and will vest in equal instalments over the years following the first anniversary of the grant date. The options expire after 8 years.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Having completed the operational turnaround in 2024, we have now entered a period of accelerated, technology-driven growth underpinned by our lean, B2B-focused model. The benefits of this transition are evident in our financial and operational performance for the period, with management focused on increasing revenue and EBITDA. H1 2025 resulted in revenue increasing by 75% and EBITDA reaching \u20ac0.30 million (compared to \u20ac0.18 million in H1 2024).\nWe are no longer a turnaround story. We are now a scalable B2B marketing platform focused on performance, efficiency, and innovation. Our technology-led customer acquisition capabilities, enhanced partner base, and expanding geographic reach position us to deliver continued growth and long-term value creation.\nOperational Review\nDuring H1 2025, we made strong progress across the business, with revenue rising to \u20ac2.41 million (H1 2024: \u20ac1.38 million) and increasing EBITDA to \u20ac0.30 million (H1 2024: \u20ac0.18 million). Growth was driven by increased volumes from existing partners and the onboarding of new B2B relationships. Our scalable pay-per-click engine continues to deliver high-quality leads and first-time depositing customers, through more than 200 partners. These results reflect a disciplined focus on performance marketing, cost control, and operational leverage.\nAt the heart of our growth is a high-performing marketing platform underpinn",

This reflects continued momentum in B90's transition to a lean, scalable, B2B-focused model.\nAs a result of the progress made, the Board expects full-year 2025 revenue and EBITDA to at least be in line with market expectations.\nThe Group's scalable pay-per-click engine continues to deliver high-quality leads and first-time depositing customers to its B2B partners, underpinning strong commercial traction. The number of active partner accounts grew during the period, with new partnerships already contributing to total revenue. Operational efficiency remains a core focus, with operating expenses held relatively flat despite a significant increase in both revenue and EBITDA on the prior year comparable period.\nLooking ahead to the second half of 2025, the Group's priorities include continuing to scale the existing business as partner revenue grows and further diversifying its marketing channel mix. Technology remains central to operations, with early adoption of AI and high levels of automation continuing to underpin performance. The Company remains confident in delivering another year of material revenue and EBITDA growth.\nCommenting on the outlook for the remainder of the year, Executive Chairman Ronny Breivik said:\n\"B90 is no longer just a turnaround story; it is now a technology-led B2B marketing growth story. Strong year-on-year growth confirms that our pivot from B2C gambling operations to a leaner, B2B-led model is working. Our first-half results represent clear progress and position us well for the remainder of the year.\n\"We now have a solid platform to scale more aggressively, and our focus will be on growing revenues from existing assets; expanding our partner base; unlocking new geographies; and investing in next-generation marketing channels.\n\"Technology remains at the core of our model, and we will continue to embrace AI and automation to ensure efficiency at scale. We remain confident in delivering another year of material revenue and EBITDA growth.\"\n-Ends-\nThe information communicated in this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\u00a0as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.b90holdings.com\nor contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Executive ChairmanMarcel Noordeloos, Finance Director\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson / Rob Patrick\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nRosewood (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Since the Company's H1 2024 results were announced on 23 September 2024, the Company continued to trade well during the final quarter of the year, remaining EBITDA positive for every month of 2024. The Company expects to at least meet current market expectations at EBITDA level for FY 2024, with further growth anticipated in FY 2025 as the operational efficiency of its business model continues to drive performance.\nBuilding on this momentum, the Company anticipates further organic growth in FY 2025, underpinned by its streamlined operational model and innovative marketing initiatives, driving customer acquisition and positive results for over 200 partners, including major brands like Bet365 and Stake.com. Focus remains on organic growth, as marketing-led customer acquisition and B2B partnerships continue to yield positive results.\nThe Company's continued shift to a B2B-focused model in H2 2024 has proven instrumental in driving increased EBITDA profitability. By outsourcing its remaining legacy online sportsbook and casino operations to a white-label solution, B90 has been able to optimise (and therefore significantly reduce) operating costs and concentrate its resources on performance marketing.\nRonny Breivik, Executive Chairman of B90 Holdings plc, commented:\n\"2024 was a truly transformative year for B90. Maintaining positive EBITDA in every single month is an achievement that reflects the resilience of our business model and the incredible hard work of our team. Our strategic pivot to a B2B-focused operation is not just delivering short term results - it is more than anything positioning us for long-term success.\n\"We will build on the massive groundwork done, and we remain focused on building exceptional value for both our shareholders and B2B partners. Our ability to thrive amidst challenges is proof that B90 is stronger and more innovative than ever.

During the last quarter of the year the Company restructured its casino and sportsbook operations and transitioned to an outsourced solution.\nRevenue1 and reported loss1 for FY 2023 are expected to be in line with market expectations, although increased marketing and administrative expenses (including one-off restructuring costs) during the year are expected to result in an increased adjusted EBITDA loss1 over 2022.\nStrategically, the Group has undergone a significant shift to focus on its B2B operations. This includes the discontinuation of B2C gambling on www.Bet90.com and the relaunch of the platform as a comprehensive affiliate site offering a wide range of content, including\ncasino reviews\nand information about available bonuses for both sportsbook and casino. B90 has now successfully established over 200 partnerships in the industry with notable names such as Bet365, Unibet, ComeOn Group and Betsson Group.\nIn line with this strategic realignment, B90 has also streamlined operations at\nwww.spinbookie.com\n. In January 2024, the Company partnered with a specialised platform and operations partner. The Company is now fully focused on its B2B, performance marketing strategy.\nThis move has already reduced Group operating costs and enhances the Company's focus on affiliate marketing efforts. The new look and feel of\nSpinbookie.com\nis live and operational, providing a much-improved customer experience.\nThe operations of Emwys and\nwww.oddsen.nu\n, dedicated to engaging users with online gaming forums and maintaining affiliate agreements within the Nordic region, have performed in line with management expectations during FY 2023. Full integration of Emwys, acquired in July 2023, into the Group has now been completed.\nThe Company also announces that Marcel Noordeloos has agreed to continue in his position as Finance Director and to remain on the Board.\nExecutive Chairman Ronny Breivik commented:\n\"Our strategic refocus on B2B operations within the iGaming sector, particularly with the relaunch of\nBet90.com\nand the outsourcing of operations at\nSpinbookie.com,\nunderpins the shift in our business model. These initiatives are central towards achieving our target of profitability, and to driving shareholder, value in 2024.\n\"We remain committed to leveraging our industry experience and partnerships to deliver innovative solutions, driving our performance marketing and affiliate services. We are increasingly confident in our operational execution and our ability to build a strong foundation for sustainable growth and shareholder value. With an enhanced management team and a stronger Board, complemented by the backing of investment, as well as strategic and practical guidance from seasoned, insightful investors in our sector, we are well-positioned to realise our growth strategy.\"\n1\nUnaudited.\n-Ends-\nFor further information please contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Executive Chairman\nMarcel Noordeloos, Finance Director\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson / Rob Patrick\nZeus Capital Limited (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nBelvedere (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Platforms like Emwys, oddsen.nu, and tippen4you.com, dedicated to the Scandinavian market, engage users with online gaming forums and maintain affiliate agreements. Spinbookie and Bet90, licensed platforms, offer sports betting and casino experiences covering global sporting events.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Partnerships:\nB90 has established collaborations with renowned brands such as Playtech, Bet365, Betsafe, and Betsson, strengthening its market presence.\n\u00b7\nIndustry Expertise:\nMark Blandford, founder of Sportingbet, joined as Strategic Adviser, bringing extensive experience and insights to the team. Team composition further strengthened with appointments of Andrew McIver as a non-executive director, Ronny Breivik taking the role of Executive Chairman and Farzad Peyman bringing his expertise in finance and M&A strategy.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nRevenue Performance:\nRevenues for H1 2023 amounted to \u20ac754,659, reflecting a 25% decrease compared to the same period in 2022 mainly due to the unexpected internal restructuring after the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held in November 2022, which took internal focus away from revenue generation. Management is targeting a revenue recovery now these adjustments have been implemented.\n\u00b7\nNet Loss Analysis:\nIn addition to the change in revenue, the net operating loss for H1 2023 was \u20ac1,623,398, influenced by increased amortization charges resulting from acquisitions in H2 2021 and increased marketing spend, of which a major portion was executed in the second quarter of 2023, and anticipated to generate revenues in the second half of 2023.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Marketing Investments:\nInvestment of \u20ac361,815 (H1 2022: \u20ac266,396) in marketing initiatives during H1 2023, reflects a significant increase compared to the same period in 2022. These investments are projected to drive revenue growth in H2 2023 and beyond.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful Fundraising\n: The company secured \u20ac2.27 million (before expenses) through subscriptions for Convertible Loan Notes (\"CLN\") in H1 2023. A further CLN subscription of \u20ac2.0 million was announced in June 2023, and received after the period end, enhancing financial flexibility. Post-period end, a further \u20ac2,325,000 (or \u00a32.0 million, before expenses) was raised by way of an equity placing and subscription, bringing the total raised in this financial year to \u20ac6.6 million. Concurrent with this most recent fundraise, the Company served conversion notices to all holders of the existing loan notes, thereby simplifying the Group's capital structure.\nRonny Breivik, Executive Chairman commented:\n\"We are excited with the substantial operational progress made during the first half of 2023. Our strategic acquisitions, enhanced team composition, and increased marketing investments are pivotal to our future growth. While we navigate dynamic market conditions, we are poised for success through our 'buy and build' M&A strategy and commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. The future holds great promise for B90 Holdings as it capitalises on strategic partnerships, expansion initiatives, and emerging opportunities within the dynamic gaming industry.\nHe added:\n\"We are focussed on our strategy of organic growth alongside sourcing accretive acquisitions, as symbolised by the Emwys acquisition.

With global operations, it was initially listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as a roll-up vehicle, rapidly growing through an acquisition strategy.\nUpon joining\u00a0as CEO, Andrew moved the listing to the London Stock Exchange and successfully refocused the business on operations.\nPrior to this, for over a decade, Andrew was on the board of Sportingbet plc, first as Chief Financial Officer and then as Group Chief Executive Officer. Established in 1998, Sportingbet was one of the first online gaming companies and as CFO, Andrew oversaw the financing for its $300 million acquisition of Canada's Paradise Poker.\nAndrew has also been Director of Finance for House of Fraser plc and held senior roles at British Telecom plc, Hilton Group Finance plc (now Ladbrokes Group Finance plc), and Signet Group plc (now Signet Group Limited).

I have had the privilege to know and work with Andrew for many years, a respected individual in the gaming industry, with a wealth of unmatched experience.

In conjunction with the Acquisition, B90 and Funko have also entered into a short term associated licence and marketing agreement with regard to Funko's Google advertising account used by Emwys for PPC marketing (the \"Google PPC Account\"), currently conducted in the Finnish market (the \"Licence Agreement\" and, together with the Acquisition, the \"Transaction\").\nThe Transaction will provide B90 with a significant asset to enhance its marketing capabilities and generate future revenue through strategic affiliate partnerships. The expected closing date for the Acquisition is no later than 1 September 2023 (the \"Closing Date\").\nEmwys and the\nAcquisition\nThe total consideration payable by B90 under the Acquisition is, in aggregate, up to\n\u20ac3.6 million for Emwys' entire share capital on\na cash free and debt free basis.\nThe initial consideration payable is an immediate payment of\n\u20ac500,000 in cash and \u20ac250,000 in the form of convertible loan notes (the \"CLNs\"), both of which are non-refundable\n. The balance\nconsideration is payable on the Closing Date,\nsubject to certain performance conditions being achieved, and consists of \u20ac1.25 million in cash and \u20ac1.6 million either in the form of CLNs or the issue of new ordinary shares in the Company at the closing mid-price on the business day prior to the Closing Date (with any such shares subject to a 3-month lock-in period), at the election of the Company.\nThe cash element of the initial and balance consideration is intended to be\nfunded from the proceeds of the Subscription announced to market on 30 June 2023, with the final instalment of the\n\u20ac2 million to be received shortly, following which the CLNs will be issued and the market updated\n.\nAlternatively,\nthe Company can elect to settle the entire balance consideration for \u20ac2.25 million in cash at the Closing Date, subject to available cash balances. The assets being acquired are expected to be positive cash flow generating in Q4 2023.\nThe CLNs have a term of three years from issue and are convertible no earlier than 31 December 2023, at the request of the CLN holder, at a 10% discount to the volume weighted average price for the five trading days prior to the conversion notice. The CLNs are convertible, at the discretion of the Company, at any time and on the same terms. The CLNs carry a coupon of 10% per annum, which shall accrue and be paid in cash or shares at the Company's election, upon redemption or conversion.\nTo date, Emwys has been focused on marketing online gambling services in Finland, and B90 plans to expand into new territories using the knowledge and assets acquired in order to drive traffic and boost revenues for its existing and new affiliate accounts. By utilising Emwys' expertise, B90 aims to maximise its reach and capitalise on the growing demand for online gambling marketing services.

His family investment portfolio now spans over\n40\ncompanies across a broad range of sectors, but still with a primary focus on gaming, support services and data driven scalable tech businesses. He is a current non-executive director of\nGaming Realms plc (AIM: GMR), the developer and licensor of mobile focused gaming content. He also sits\nas Chairman of the b\noard of Nasdaq-listed Gambling.com Group Limited (Nasdaq: GAMB),\na performance marketing company and a leading provider of digital marketing services active in the global online gambling industry.\nMark s\nerves as Chairman of the board of directors at FSB Technology (U.K.) Ltd., Double Diamond\nGaming\nLimited, and Condor Properties.\nRonny Breivik, Interim Executive Chairman of B90, commented:\n\"Mark has pioneered the development, financing, and monetising of digital Pay2Play entertainment companies over the last fifteen years and having worked with him previously at Sportingbet, I am extremely pleased that he has invested in B90 and has now agreed to become a strategic adviser to the Company. His experience, advice, market insight and knowledge; as well as his network of contacts, will be invaluable to us as we embark on the next phase of our growth.\"\nMark Blandford added:\n\"B90 is determined\nto make more use of the opportunities afforded by its listing on the AIM market, particularly as it is one of the few stock market listed online bookmakers and gaming companies on that market at present. I look forward to supporting Ronny and his team in identifying and monetizing these opportunities.\"\n-Ends-\nFor further information please contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Interim Executive Chairman\nMarcel Noordeloos, Chief Financial Officer\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson / Rob Patrick\nZeus Capital (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Tim Dainton\nBelvedere (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20\n3008 6864\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus\nAbout B90 Holdings plc\nB90 Holdings plc is a group of companies focused\non the operation of its own online Sportsbook and Casino product as well as marketing activities for other online gaming companies.\nWebsite:\nwww.b90holdings.com\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

I've been watching this stock for a few years and didn't want to buy until I was sure the bottom was reached and we were in for a turnaround. The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023. On the contrary, his positions has increased.",

Nor have I accumulated any new shares for quite some time. I want to see green numbers before doing so. Once that occurs, I will start adding. Full Year 2023 results should be announced soon. The management would be wise to guide us on expectations for 2024. The tone in previous RNSes has been that the Company targets profitability in the short term. It would obviously be amazing news should the management manage to get\u00a0this\u00a0executed. That remains to be seen, but I think they will deliver.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025. These factors support a bullish view on the stock. Link to the trading update attached below: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news",

What a bummer the last months have been, with Bet90 going offline for ages, with little to no explanation (rumor has it the reason for the down period was due to a mix of technical stuff and change of jurisdiction for their License). Thankfully it's up & running again now, and looking much better than before. Lots of improvements, with a brand new Casino with a huge selection, and a very good looking Live-casino. Odds selection was always top notch, but it's now maybe even better than before. The stock has fallen to rock bottom, as low as 5,6 GBX yesterday (!) Makes parts of my investment at 14 GBX look pretty darn horrible. On the bright side, I have averaged down :) But now for some good news; I am 100% sure that we will receive, not good, not great, but rather absolutely fabulous news from B90's activity in South America. And the extraordinary growth the company will report from those markets, combined with restructuring and cost control, will elevate the share price considerably. I think we will see the share price sky-rocket when the market see the results of the restructure process, and the numbers start ticking in. Today B90 is priced as a bankruptcy candidate. My view is that this is almost like buying a derivative right now. The upside is extreme. Let's see what happens. Hang in there...",

Parts is based on gathered information. The restructure of the company and board of directors is no secret, and something I regard as vital. So is the strategy of expanding in emerging markets such as Central & South America. Imagine the population of Brazil alone is 215 million, that's more than three times the population in the UK (!) Add another 20 million people in the very attractive market of Chile, etc. It all adds up to one very interesting region, and B90 Plc is on it as we speak! They are hiring people.

TamirApril 24, 2022 Spread financial intelligence In June 2022, the trials against some ringleaders of the cybercrime organization of Uwe Lenhoff, who died in prison, will start in Germany. The \u201cold\u201d B90 Holdings plc, which operated as Veltyco Group PLC at the time, was founded by Lenhoff and played an essential role in his scams. Since Lenhoff\u2019s death in July 2020, some things have changed at B90 Holdings, while others have remained the same. CFO Marcel Noordeloos is still in place, and the Lenhoff partner Dirk-Jan Bakker is still one of the principal shareholders. In April 2021, Ronny Breivik was appointed as CEO; he is also one of the largest economic owners. Key data Trading names\tBet90 Bet90 Holdings Bet90 Ventures Spinbookie Domains\twww.bet90.com www.spinbookie.com www.b90holdings.com Legal entities\tBet90 Holdings plc, Isle of Man Bet 90 Sports Limited (old), Malta Spintastic NV (new), Curacao Entercreation Ltd, Malta Related individuals\tUwe Lenhoff (deceased founder) Ronny Breivik Karim Peer Marcel Noordeloos Dirk-Jan Bakker Paul Westerterp Regulators\tFCA for Bet90 Holdings plc MGA for Entercreation Ltd MGA for B90 Sports Ltd Curacao eGaming (CEG) for Spintastic NV Ronny Breivik takes over B90 CEO Ronny Breivik is also a shareholder of Malta-based Entercreation Ltd Norwegian gambling veteran Ronny Ingvar Breivik has been appointed CEO of B90 Ventures Ltd, the operating subsidiary of the listed holding company. Breivik is also one of the shareholders of Entercreation Ltd in Malta, according to Offshore Leaks. From the latter, B90 Holdings acquired online gaming and sports betting venture Spinbookie at the end of 2021. The release did not mention that this was a transaction between related companies. Until recently, Malta-based MGA-regulated Bet 90 Sports Limited was the operator of online sports betting and casino provider Bet90 (ww.bet90.com). Since the acquisition of Spinbookie, both are operated by Spintastic NV with a license in Curacao. Over the last 18 months, a structural shift in the shareholder structure has apparently taken place due to the acquisitions of various businesses such as Spinbookie or Oddsen in the environment of CEO Ronny Breivik and the issue of shares to affiliate partners. In addition, there were also several capital increases or convertible loans to which new shareholders also subscribed. In addition, stock options were granted. The number of shares issued massively increased to almost 240 million. Uwe Lenhoff's family is still a large shareholder in B90 Holdings As of December 31, 2021, Dutch investor Paul Westerterp, Performance Media, and Dutch real estate investor Dirk-Jan Bakker (via Vancom Ltd and Diman BV) were the largest shareholders. If the shares of Entercreation, Performance Media, and Ronny Breivik are counted as one block, that is the largest shareholder and controls more than 16% of the company. Enter",

When someone is trying to tell you that a $1.3m loss is a huge improvement from last years $1.4m loss, you know they are full of BS. When someone is using the RNS as a platform to issue long letters bashing the very same shareholders that have saved the company from insolvency several times the last 18 months, you know they are full of BS. When someone is accusing others of not acting in the best interest of all shareholders, while the very same someone has both hands in the cookie jar, rewarding themselves every Q with endless amounts of stock options and huge salaries, you KNOW they are full of BS. When someone has failed miserably, again and again, still wont let go, and lashes out at anyone suggesting their time is up, you know they are full of BS. This someone is the current board of B90 Plc, and it's chairman Karim Peer. Right now they are doing what they can to cling on to their seats at the table, so that they can continue to dilute all other shareholders to oblivion, while they reward themselves stock options. Meanwhile not having enough liquidity to even pay their customers (but always having cash on hand to pay themselves..) Shameless to ask for the continued support from the community of shareholders. Throw them to the wolves. Do not delegate 1 vote to these a-holes. The RNS today was a weird mix of innuendo and hearsay. Karim Peer speculates & concludes on a number of topics, including derogatory reference related to the very same candidates which have been put forward as candidates to replace him. Karim Peer share a resemblance to unsavoury characters clinging to power, by attempting to undermine his opponents. And how undemocratic and completely in breach with every Corporate Governance principle isn't this RNSs failure to provide an alternative for voting. Karim Peer & co are providing recipients one option: support them, and delegate your vote by Proxy to them. And if shareholders are fed up and want a change? Sorry, zero information provided in the RNS about that part (!) Karim Peer should apply for a job at Robinhood (you know, the guys who removed the Buy-button..) I would strongly urge everyone who own B90 shares to vote in favor of the resolutions (if they allow you to do so...) Get rid of this POS.",

I've been watching this stock for a few years and didn't want to buy until I was sure the bottom was reached and we were in for a turnaround. The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

Price target set forth is more than double the current trading price (!) It seems cost reduction measures has been successful. I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023. On the contrary, his positions has increased.",

          "content": "$B90 Holdings Plc (LSE: B90) is finally showing its potential as a remarkable turnaround story, and it\u2019s heartening to see some reward for loyal investors. The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

          "content": "@Nerd Happy to hear that you have belief in your investment. My belief, however, is that there's just no way this won't end in misery. The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations.

The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends.

          "content": "$B90 Holdings Plc (LSE: B90) is finally showing its potential as a remarkable turnaround story, and it\u2019s heartening to see some reward for loyal investors. The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025. These factors support a bullish view on the stock. Link to the trading update attached below: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news",

What a bummer the last months have been, with Bet90 going offline for ages, with little to no explanation (rumor has it the reason for the down period was due to a mix of technical stuff and change of jurisdiction for their License). Thankfully it's up & running again now, and looking much better than before. Lots of improvements, with a brand new Casino with a huge selection, and a very good looking Live-casino. Odds selection was always top notch, but it's now maybe even better than before. The stock has fallen to rock bottom, as low as 5,6 GBX yesterday (!) Makes parts of my investment at 14 GBX look pretty darn horrible. On the bright side, I have averaged down :) But now for some good news; I am 100% sure that we will receive, not good, not great, but rather absolutely fabulous news from B90's activity in South America. And the extraordinary growth the company will report from those markets, combined with restructuring and cost control, will elevate the share price considerably. I think we will see the share price sky-rocket when the market see the results of the restructure process, and the numbers start ticking in. Today B90 is priced as a bankruptcy candidate. My view is that this is almost like buying a derivative right now. The upside is extreme. Let's see what happens. Hang in there...",

Parts is based on gathered information. The restructure of the company and board of directors is no secret, and something I regard as vital. So is the strategy of expanding in emerging markets such as Central & South America. Imagine the population of Brazil alone is 215 million, that's more than three times the population in the UK (!) Add another 20 million people in the very attractive market of Chile, etc. It all adds up to one very interesting region, and B90 Plc is on it as we speak! They are hiring people. Always a good sign!",

TamirApril 24, 2022 Spread financial intelligence In June 2022, the trials against some ringleaders of the cybercrime organization of Uwe Lenhoff, who died in prison, will start in Germany. The \u201cold\u201d B90 Holdings plc, which operated as Veltyco Group PLC at the time, was founded by Lenhoff and played an essential role in his scams. Since Lenhoff\u2019s death in July 2020, some things have changed at B90 Holdings, while others have remained the same. CFO Marcel Noordeloos is still in place, and the Lenhoff partner Dirk-Jan Bakker is still one of the principal shareholders. In April 2021, Ronny Breivik was appointed as CEO; he is also one of the largest economic owners. Key data Trading names\tBet90 Bet90 Holdings Bet90 Ventures Spinbookie Domains\twww.bet90.com www.spinbookie.com www.b90holdings.com Legal entities\tBet90 Holdings plc, Isle of Man Bet 90 Sports Limited (old), Malta Spintastic NV (new), Curacao Entercreation Ltd, Malta Related individuals\tUwe Lenhoff (deceased founder) Ronny Breivik Karim Peer Marcel Noordeloos Dirk-Jan Bakker Paul Westerterp Regulators\tFCA for Bet90 Holdings plc MGA for Entercreation Ltd MGA for B90 Sports Ltd Curacao eGaming (CEG) for Spintastic NV Ronny Breivik takes over B90 CEO Ronny Breivik is also a shareholder of Malta-based Entercreation Ltd Norwegian gambling veteran Ronny Ingvar Breivik has been appointed CEO of B90 Ventures Ltd, the operating subsidiary of the listed holding company. Breivik is also one of the shareholders of Entercreation Ltd in Malta, according to Offshore Leaks. From the latter, B90 Holdings acquired online gaming and sports betting venture Spinbookie at the end of 2021. The release did not mention that this was a transaction between related companies. Until recently, Malta-based MGA-regulated Bet 90 Sports Limited was the operator of online sports betting and casino provider Bet90 (ww.bet90.com). Since the acquisition of Spinbookie, both are operated by Spintastic NV with a license in Curacao. Over the last 18 months, a structural shift in the shareholder structure has apparently taken place due to the acquisitions of various businesses such as Spinbookie or Oddsen in the environment of CEO Ronny Breivik and the issue of shares to affiliate partners. In addition, there were also several capital increases or convertible loans to which new shareholders also subscribed. In addition, stock options were granted. The number of shares issued massively increased to almost 240 million. Uwe Lenhoff's family is still a large shareholder in B90 Holdings As of December 31, 2021, Dutch investor Paul Westerterp, Performance Media, and Dutch real estate investor Dirk-Jan Bakker (via Vancom Ltd and Diman BV) were the largest shareholders. If the shares of Entercreation, Performance Media, and Ronny Breivik are counted as one block, that is the largest shareholder and controls more than 16% of the company. Enter",

When someone is trying to tell you that a $1.3m loss is a huge improvement from last years $1.4m loss, you know they are full of BS. When someone is using the RNS as a platform to issue long letters bashing the very same shareholders that have saved the company from insolvency several times the last 18 months, you know they are full of BS. When someone is accusing others of not acting in the best interest of all shareholders, while the very same someone has both hands in the cookie jar, rewarding themselves every Q with endless amounts of stock options and huge salaries, you KNOW they are full of BS. When someone has failed miserably, again and again, still wont let go, and lashes out at anyone suggesting their time is up, you know they are full of BS. This someone is the current board of B90 Plc, and it's chairman Karim Peer. Right now they are doing what they can to cling on to their seats at the table, so that they can continue to dilute all other shareholders to oblivion, while they reward themselves stock options. Meanwhile not having enough liquidity to even pay their customers (but always having cash on hand to pay themselves..) Shameless to ask for the continued support from the community of shareholders. Throw them to the wolves. Do not delegate 1 vote to these a-holes. The RNS today was a weird mix of innuendo and hearsay. Karim Peer speculates & concludes on a number of topics, including derogatory reference related to the very same candidates which have been put forward as candidates to replace him. Karim Peer share a resemblance to unsavoury characters clinging to power, by attempting to undermine his opponents. And how undemocratic and completely in breach with every Corporate Governance principle isn't this RNSs failure to provide an alternative for voting. Karim Peer & co are providing recipients one option: support them, and delegate your vote by Proxy to them. And if shareholders are fed up and want a change? Sorry, zero information provided in the RNS about that part (!) Karim Peer should apply for a job at Robinhood (you know, the guys who removed the Buy-button..) I would strongly urge everyone who own B90 shares to vote in favor of the resolutions (if they allow you to do so...) Get rid of this POS.",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base.

This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends.

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

Price target set forth is more than double the current trading price (!) It seems cost reduction measures has been successful. I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023. On the contrary, his positions has increased.",

The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025. These factors support a bullish view on the stock. Link to the trading update attached below: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news",

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

Why is there not a front page proclaiming clearly what it does (and correctly spelled (see \"are\" instead of \"era\") with appropriate links to region  specific and sport specific content for example. As it stands, I can't see this website being  a great organic growth story. I hope I'm wrong.",

I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023. On the contrary, his positions has increased.",

The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025. These factors support a bullish view on the stock. Link to the trading update attached below: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news",

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

Subject to the completion of the audit process, EBITDA is expected to be in line with market expectations, reflecting higher marketing spend, primarily driven by increased competition and rising costs across Google-led acquisition channels.\nOperational Highlights\nB90 has further embedded automation, AI and machine-learning tools across its marketing and operational infrastructure, enabling the Group to scale activity without a commensurate increase in overheads. This continued evolution of the operating model is enhancing campaign efficiency, improving partner returns and supporting margin progression.\nThe Group's pay-per-click operations, underpinned by experienced in-house teams and data-driven optimisation, delivered a growing volume of high-quality leads and first-time depositing customers (\"FTDs\") to an expanding base of B2B partners.\nIncreased automation has improved targeting, campaign optimisation and real-time decision-making, while maintaining tight control over customer acquisition costs.\nOperational cash generation remained a key focus during the period, with marketing investment funded from cash generated from operations. This disciplined approach has enabled the Group to reinvest selectively behind its strongest-performing activities while maintaining control of the overall cost base.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, 2026 is expected to follow a similar strategic trajectory, with an increased emphasis on automation, AI-driven optimisation and scalable growth. The Group believes its technology-led model is well positioned to benefit from major global sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup in 2026, which historically drive increased customer acquisition activity and first-time depositor volumes across the sector.\nRonny Breivik, Executive Chairman of B90 Holdings plc, commented:\n\"Looking ahead, our priorities are clear. We will continue to scale our core pay-per-click and owned-media operations, while increasing automation across the business to drive growth without incremental cost inflation. We will invest selectively in marketing where returns are demonstrable and cash generative, deepen and strengthen our partner network, and remain highly disciplined in our approach to cash management and operational execution.\n\"We are confident that this focus will support continued growth, improving operating leverage and enabling the Group to deliver another year of material revenue and EBITDA growth.\"\n- Ends -\nThe information communicated in this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\u00a0as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.b90holdings.com\nor contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Executive ChairmanMarcel Noordeloos, Finance Director\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nRosewood (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "Looking at the RNS released on Monday, which provides guidance for 2025, it seems that the B90 has improved significantly, moving from a net loss of \u00a35.5m in 2023 to a net profit in 2025. This suggests that we should see a substantial cash amount on the balance sheet when the audited numbers are released. This is compared to the FY numbers for 2024. If this does not signal a completed turnaround, I do not know what will. The analyst target price set in 2023 was around 9p. From my calculations, it looks like the company is in line with or ahead of the numbers at that time. However, the stock is still trading under 4p. Go figure! The forward-looking part of the RNS released by the company indicates that all is well and that the company has started the year well. Or at least, that's my interpretation. I guess we'll find out when the audited numbers are released. Hopefully, a full Q1 update will follow. No matter how I look at it now, I think the share price does not reflect the analyst valuation, which has been available for a long time. Nor does the share price compare well with that of peers, in my opinion, given the growth that B90 can produce in comparison. Finally, B90 is a highly automated company. Whenever an interview is published or an RNS is released, the focus is often on AI and machine learning. In a world where competitors seem to be outperformed by AI (as many of them rely on traditional SEO methods), B90 is a breath of fresh AI air. It's refreshing to see AI making a meaningful impact on a business for a change. I hope this continues to be the case. If so, it will only improve margins going forward. That will be good for the shares I hold. And my God have I been patient.. Like Anthropic's Claude AI tool is changing the game in the legal software market, with legal tech companies reaching billions in valuation and AI tools beginning to match or outperform lawyers in speed and accuracy, I hope to see the same development accross the board, including the sector B90 operates in. I continue to hold. Not gonna sell @ single digits.",

The management would be wise to guide us on expectations for 2024. The tone in previous RNSes has been that the Company targets profitability in the short term.

I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023. On the contrary, his positions has increased.",

The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025.

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

The changes reflect the Company's growing scale and maturity as a public company and align B90 with best practice corporate governance standards, providing clearer distinction between independent Board oversight and executive management.\nAndy has been a Non-Executive Director of B90 since August 2023, where he has served as Chair of the Audit Committee, and brings extensive experience of digital gaming and public markets. This includes having been Non-Executive Chairman of leading Italian gambling company Planet Win/SKS365 Malta Ltd, CEO of Jackpotjoy plc, one of the world's largest online bingo operators, and CEO of leading online gambling company Sportingbet plc.\nMartin Fleisje, independent Non-Executive Director, will assume the role of Chair of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will comprise Martin Fleisje (Chair) and Andy McIver.\nRonny Breivik, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"As B90 continues to scale and mature as a public company, it is right that our governance structures evolve alongside it. Separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides greater clarity and focus across the Group and reflects both the progress we have made and our ambitions for the future.\n\"I am delighted that Andy will assume the role of Chairman, bringing deep sector experience and strong governance insight, while I continue to focus fully on executing our strategy and driving long-term value for shareholders.\"\nAndy McIver, Non-Executive Chairman, added:\n\"Having worked closely with the Board as a Non-Executive Director, I am pleased to assume the role of Chairman at this important stage in B90's development. The Company has built a scalable, technology-led platform with a clear strategic focus and strong operational discipline. I look forward to working closely with Ronny and the executive team as B90 continues to execute its growth strategy.\"\n-ends-\nFor further information please visit\nwww.b90holdings.com\nor contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Chief Executive OfficerMarcel Noordeloos, Chief Financial Officer\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nRosewood (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "Looking at the RNS released on Monday, which provides guidance for 2025, it seems that the B90 has improved significantly, moving from a net loss of \u00a35.5m in 2023 to a net profit in 2025. This suggests that we should see a substantial cash amount on the balance sheet when the audited numbers are released. This is compared to the FY numbers for 2024. If this does not signal a completed turnaround, I do not know what will. The analyst target price set in 2023 was around 9p. From my calculations, it looks like the company is in line with or ahead of the numbers at that time. However, the stock is still trading under 4p. Go figure! The forward-looking part of the RNS released by the company indicates that all is well and that the company has started the year well. Or at least, that's my interpretation. I guess we'll find out when the audited numbers are released. Hopefully, a full Q1 update will follow. No matter how I look at it now, I think the share price does not reflect the analyst valuation, which has been available for a long time. Nor does the share price compare well with that of peers, in my opinion, given the growth that B90 can produce in comparison. Finally, B90 is a highly automated company. Whenever an interview is published or an RNS is released, the focus is often on AI and machine learning. In a world where competitors seem to be outperformed by AI (as many of them rely on traditional SEO methods), B90 is a breath of fresh AI air. It's refreshing to see AI making a meaningful impact on a business for a change. I hope this continues to be the case. If so, it will only improve margins going forward. That will be good for the shares I hold. And my God have I been patient.. Like Anthropic's Claude AI tool is changing the game in the legal software market, with legal tech companies reaching billions in valuation and AI tools beginning to match or outperform lawyers in speed and accuracy, I hope to see the same development accross the board, including the sector B90 operates in. I continue to hold. Not gonna sell @ single digits.",

I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023.

The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate.

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025. These factors support a bullish view on the stock. Link to the trading update attached below: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news",

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

          "content": "$B90 Holdings Plc (LSE: B90) is finally showing its potential as a remarkable turnaround story, and it\u2019s heartening to see some reward for loyal investors. The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

          "content": "Looking at the RNS released on Monday, which provides guidance for 2025, it seems that the B90 has improved significantly, moving from a net loss of \u00a35.5m in 2023 to a net profit in 2025. This suggests that we should see a substantial cash amount on the balance sheet when the audited numbers are released. This is compared to the FY numbers for 2024. If this does not signal a completed turnaround, I do not know what will. The analyst target price set in 2023 was around 9p. From my calculations, it looks like the company is in line with or ahead of the numbers at that time. However, the stock is still trading under 4p. Go figure! The forward-looking part of the RNS released by the company indicates that all is well and that the company has started the year well. Or at least, that's my interpretation. I guess we'll find out when the audited numbers are released. Hopefully, a full Q1 update will follow. No matter how I look at it now, I think the share price does not reflect the analyst valuation, which has been available for a long time. Nor does the share price compare well with that of peers, in my opinion, given the growth that B90 can produce in comparison. Finally, B90 is a highly automated company. Whenever an interview is published or an RNS is released, the focus is often on AI and machine learning. In a world where competitors seem to be outperformed by AI (as many of them rely on traditional SEO methods), B90 is a breath of fresh AI air. It's refreshing to see AI making a meaningful impact on a business for a change. I hope this continues to be the case. If so, it will only improve margins going forward. That will be good for the shares I hold. And my God have I been patient.. Like Anthropic's Claude AI tool is changing the game in the legal software market, with legal tech companies reaching billions in valuation and AI tools beginning to match or outperform lawyers in speed and accuracy, I hope to see the same development accross the board, including the sector B90 operates in. I continue to hold. Not gonna sell @ single digits.",

Price target set forth is more than double the current trading price (!) It seems cost reduction measures has been successful. I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023. On the contrary, his positions has increased.",

Not many companies will go out and guide in strong wording how the year will look like. From my point of view, B90 went very far in saying profitability is\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0expected.",

The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025.

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

          "content": "Looking at the RNS released on Monday, which provides guidance for 2025, it seems that the B90 has improved significantly, moving from a net loss of \u00a35.5m in 2023 to a net profit in 2025. This suggests that we should see a substantial cash amount on the balance sheet when the audited numbers are released. This is compared to the FY numbers for 2024. If this does not signal a completed turnaround, I do not know what will. The analyst target price set in 2023 was around 9p. From my calculations, it looks like the company is in line with or ahead of the numbers at that time. However, the stock is still trading under 4p. Go figure! The forward-looking part of the RNS released by the company indicates that all is well and that the company has started the year well. Or at least, that's my interpretation. I guess we'll find out when the audited numbers are released. Hopefully, a full Q1 update will follow. No matter how I look at it now, I think the share price does not reflect the analyst valuation, which has been available for a long time. Nor does the share price compare well with that of peers, in my opinion, given the growth that B90 can produce in comparison. Finally, B90 is a highly automated company. Whenever an interview is published or an RNS is released, the focus is often on AI and machine learning. In a world where competitors seem to be outperformed by AI (as many of them rely on traditional SEO methods), B90 is a breath of fresh AI air. It's refreshing to see AI making a meaningful impact on a business for a change. I hope this continues to be the case. If so, it will only improve margins going forward. That will be good for the shares I hold. And my God have I been patient.. Like Anthropic's Claude AI tool is changing the game in the legal software market, with legal tech companies reaching billions in valuation and AI tools beginning to match or outperform lawyers in speed and accuracy, I hope to see the same development accross the board, including the sector B90 operates in. I continue to hold. Not gonna sell @ single digits.",

It would obviously be amazing news should the management manage to get\u00a0this\u00a0executed. That remains to be seen, but I think they will deliver.",

I strongly believe that Mr.Ronny Breivik and his team has made some tough, but right, choices, and the shift in strategy is now paying off. Also, IMO, having Mr.Mark Blandford, the founder of Sportingbet, on the team as an advisor, has been a valuable asset for the company. I also think it is worth mentioning that Mr.Blandford is a significant shareholder in the company, and furthermore; as far as I can tell he has not sold any shares during 2023.

I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate.

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base. This diversification mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single income source and enhances long-term stability. Positive Full-Year Outlook: The update states that B90 expects its full-year 2025 performance to align with market expectations. This forward-looking confidence suggests that the company anticipates continued momentum, supported by its strategic initiatives and market positioning. Market Positioning and Brand Strength: B90\u2019s focus on licensed platforms offering sports betting and online casino services, including live betting markets, positions it well in a competitive industry. The company\u2019s ability to leverage global sports events and expand its market reach enhances its brand visibility and customer engagement. Technical Indicators: According to available data, B90\u2019s stock has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d signal based on moving averages and other technical indicators. This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends. B90 Holdings PLC\u2019s trading update reflects a company on a strong growth trajectory, with significant revenue and EBITDA improvements, a diversified business model, and a positive outlook for 2025. These factors support a bullish view on the stock. Link to the trading update attached below: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news",

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",

          "content": "Looking at the RNS released on Monday, which provides guidance for 2025, it seems that the B90 has improved significantly, moving from a net loss of \u00a35.5m in 2023 to a net profit in 2025. This suggests that we should see a substantial cash amount on the balance sheet when the audited numbers are released. This is compared to the FY numbers for 2024. If this does not signal a completed turnaround, I do not know what will. The analyst target price set in 2023 was around 9p. From my calculations, it looks like the company is in line with or ahead of the numbers at that time. However, the stock is still trading under 4p. Go figure! The forward-looking part of the RNS released by the company indicates that all is well and that the company has started the year well. Or at least, that's my interpretation. I guess we'll find out when the audited numbers are released. Hopefully, a full Q1 update will follow. No matter how I look at it now, I think the share price does not reflect the analyst valuation, which has been available for a long time. Nor does the share price compare well with that of peers, in my opinion, given the growth that B90 can produce in comparison. Finally, B90 is a highly automated company. Whenever an interview is published or an RNS is released, the focus is often on AI and machine learning. In a world where competitors seem to be outperformed by AI (as many of them rely on traditional SEO methods), B90 is a breath of fresh AI air. It's refreshing to see AI making a meaningful impact on a business for a change. I hope this continues to be the case. If so, it will only improve margins going forward. That will be good for the shares I hold. And my God have I been patient.. Like Anthropic's Claude AI tool is changing the game in the legal software market, with legal tech companies reaching billions in valuation and AI tools beginning to match or outperform lawyers in speed and accuracy, I hope to see the same development accross the board, including the sector B90 operates in. I continue to hold. Not gonna sell @ single digits.",

Not many companies will go out and guide in strong wording how the year will look like. From my point of view, B90 went very far in saying profitability is\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0expected.",

The last few updates have been excellent and it's just a shame this is so under-the-radar. But it's been great to buy while so low. I noticed another buyer building a position here over the last few weeks, buying regular blocks of 20000. Maybe a TR1 soon? Let's hope for a big re-rate. CLN holders must be confident as they won't be converting until 2024!! GLA!",

          "content": "Finally! Good news! \ud83d\ude0a The trading update from B90 Holdings PLC highlights several encouraging developments that underscore the company\u2019s growth trajectory and operational success in the online gaming and sports betting sector. Key points from the update include: Strong Revenue Growth: B90 reports a significant increase in revenues for the first half of 2025, driven by robust performance across its online sportsbook and casino brands, such as Bet90 and Spinbookie. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the expanding online gaming market and attract a growing customer base. Improved EBITDA Performance: The company notes a substantial rise in EBITDA for H1 2025 compared to the previous year. This improvement in profitability indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency, positioning B90 to generate sustainable earnings as it scales its operations. Diversified Revenue Streams: B90\u2019s business model, which includes both operating its own brands and generating marketing leads through affiliate agreements (via platforms like Oddsen.nu and Tippen4you.com), provides a balanced and resilient revenue base.

This suggests potential for a rally, particularly as the market digests the positive trading update. My target is 12 GBX which represents a significant but achievable increase from the current price, reflecting technical momentum and fundamental improvements. Industry Trends: The online gaming and sports betting industry continues to experience global growth, driven by increasing digital adoption and regulatory liberalization in various markets. B90\u2019s focus on both direct operations and affiliate marketing positions it to benefit from these trends.

The company has negative working capital and will almost 100% raise money near term. Reviewing their assets one can see that one affiliate site (bet90) is a one-pager that anybody could create in less than 10 minutes, it's value is near 0. They also have an old german sportsbetting forum that have almost no monetisation but most of all, no activity what so ever. I'd be suprised if these two sites combined generate a couple of grand a month. Oddsen, their third site, is bigger but site traffic gauging tools show that it's struggling and has no growth, which is also easy to see by looking at the amount of posts made in their forum. I truly don't understand how the mcap of this ticker is anywhere near \u00a31m. There are lots of peers listed in other jurisdictions and just a quick comparison would show how the valuation is here.",

The share price has climbed over 60% from its recent low, a testament to the solid progress reported over the past 18 months. The 2024 financials were a bright spot, highlighting strong growth and a management team that\u2019s clearly steering the ship in the right direction. For those who\u2019ve weathered the storm\u2014many still down 70% despite this surge\u2014your resilience is commendable, and this uptick feels like a well-deserved step forward. For the record, personally I have not sold one single share, and I strongly believe Mr.Ronny Breivik will continue to succeed this turnaround story. I have faith in him! B90 is capitalizing on the thriving online gambling sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 11% through 2030, driven by mobile betting and expanding global markets. Their diverse portfolio of casino and sportsbook brands, paired with strategic execution, is paying off. Last year\u2019s Q2/H1 trading update on July 30th set a high bar, and I\u2019m optimistic about a potential update this month. If this management team sustains its momentum, B90 could be on track to further close the gap for long-suffering shareholders. The gambling industry\u2019s tailwinds\u2014tech innovation, regulatory progress, and rising demand\u2014position B90 well for future gains. For those considering adding to their holdings, this could be a pivotal moment. To all the steadfast investors still in the red, hang in there\u2014B90\u2019s trajectory suggests brighter days ahead. #B90 #GamblingStocks #Turnaround",
