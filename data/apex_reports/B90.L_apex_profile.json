The main KPI for the business is EBITDA which was more than 65% higher compared to the comparative prior period, at \u20ac0.3 million - driven by revenue growth, tight cost controls, and increased partner engagement.

With increased EBITDA profitability and a 75% increase in revenue, we are delivering against our KPIs and positioning the business for scalable, long-term growth. We have been working with machine learning and AI technologies since 2009, and today they underpin almost every part of our operations. This is a core differentiator. We are a data-driven business and early adopters of AI, constantly monitoring the space for new tools to automate and improve current flows. Our lean operating model, supported by automation and AI, continues to deliver real value to partners while keeping our infrastructure agile and efficient.\n\"We enter the second half of 2025 with strong momentum, benefiting from a strong trading period and a growing portfolio of high-quality partnerships. The foundations are now firmly in place for B90 to establish itself as a leading B2B marketing group for the global gaming industry. We continue to remain focused on driving profitable growth, strengthening partner relationships, and creating sustained value for shareholders.\"\n-Ends-\nFor further information please contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Executive ChairmanMarcel Noordeloos, Finance Director\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson / Imogen Ellis\nZeus Capital Limited (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Simon Johnson\nRosewood (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nChairman's Statement\nOverview\nThe first half of 2025 has marked a pivotal phase in B90's transformation. Having completed the operational turnaround in 2024, we have now entered a period of accelerated, technology-driven growth underpinned by our lean, B2B-focused model. The benefits of this transition are evident in our financial and operational performance for the period, with management focused on increasing revenue and EBITDA. H1 2025 resulted in revenue increasing by 75% and EBITDA reaching \u20ac0.30 million (compared to \u20ac0.18 million in H1 2024).\nWe are no longer a turnaround story. We are now a scalable B2B marketing platform focused on performance, efficiency, and innovation. Our technology-led customer acquisition capabilities, enhanced partner base, and expanding geographic reach position us to deliver continued growth and long-term value creation.\nOperational Review\nDuring H1 2025, we made strong progress across the business, with revenue rising to \u20ac2.41 million (H1 2024: \u20ac1.38 million) and increasing EBITDA to \u20ac0.30 million (H1 2024: \u20ac0.18 million). Growth was driven by increased volumes from existing partners and the onboarding of new B2B relationships. Our scalable pay-per-click engine continues to deliver high-quality leads and first-time depositing customers, through more than 200 partners. These results reflect a disciplined focus on performance marketing, cost control, and operational leverage.\nAt the heart of our growth is a high-performing marketing platform underpinned by automation and AI. The now-completed turnaround has streamlined our cost base, enabling us to focus entirely on lead generation and value delivery. Brand performance remains strong: Oddsen.nu's international expansion is unlocking new revenue opportunities, with long-term agreements contributing materially. Bet90.com, relaunched as an affiliate platform, is also generating encouraging early traction.\nThis momentum is the result of deliberate planning and focused execution. We have been selective in the markets we serve and the partners we engage, prioritising sustainable growth over scale for its own sake. That discipline is supported by a lean, experienced core team whose sector knowledge and agility are central to our performance.\nOur relationships with partners are built on trust, responsiveness, and data-driven execution. We tailor acquisition strategies by season, vertical and geography, and continually optimise campaigns based on close collaboration and shared insight.\nTechnology and Innovation\nTechnology is embedded in every layer of our operations and is central to how we scale. We continue to invest in tools and platforms that enhance campaign efficiency, optimise traffic monetisation, and support real-time decision making. AI-driven targeting and automation are enabling us to generate high-quality leads at lower marginal cost, improving returns for our partners without requiring proportional increases in headcount or spend.\nAI is now integrated across almost every aspect of the business, from traffic routing and campaign analytics to market research and partner optimisation. The use of generative and predictive tools allows us to process and interpret large volumes of data in minutes, replacing what previously required multiple teams and significant time. The power of these technologies lies not just in the tools themselves, but in how we deploy them using our deep sector knowledge and operational experience.\nIn parallel, we are diversifying our marketing channel mix by exploring new channels and geographies, laying the groundwork for continued organic growth. Our scalable architecture, combined with a clear understanding of affiliate marketing dynamics, gives us a competitive advantage that is both defensible and adaptable.\nBy embedding automation and AI into our daily operations, we are able to stay lean, agile and highly focused. This is a model that continues to deliver both performance and efficiency as we scale across multiple platforms and markets.\nCorporate Review\nIn June 2025, we implemented an enhanced long-term incentive plan, granting 22 million options to directors and key staff. This aligns performance with shareholder value creation and incentivises sustained delivery over the medium term. In the same month, our Non-Executive Director Andrew McIver increased his equity holding, which is another clear demonstration of Board-level confidence in our strategy and outlook.\nWe continue to operate with a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We are selective about the events we attend, the channels we invest in, and the partnerships we pursue. By focusing on activity that builds long-term value rather than short-term visibility.\nFinancial Review\nThe Group delivered revenues of \u20ac2.41 million in H1 2025, up from \u20ac1.38 million in H1 2024, a 75% increase.\nEBITDA for the period was \u20ac0.30 million, up from \u20ac0.18 million in the prior period, while the net loss narrowed significantly to \u20ac0.04 million (H1 2024: loss of \u20ac0.32 million), after accounting for ongoing amortisation and share-based payment expenses.\nOperating expenses were held broadly flat despite the significant growth in revenue, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of our operating model. Cash at the period end stood at \u20ac0.40 million, with a modest net current asset position.\nWhile we continue to monitor liquidity closely, our financial position reflects a healthy and improving profile driven by profitability, rather than external capital. We remain confident in our ability to fund future growth through operational cash flow.\nUnaudited\nFirst 6 months of 2025\nUnaudited\nFirst 6 months of 2024\nAudited\nFull year\n2024\nNet loss\n(39,223)\n(321,954)\n(1,701,414)\nAmortisation & Depreciation\n282,102\n381,966\n763,932\nImpairments\n-\n-\n1,398,107\nShare based payments\n66,336\n130,975\n219,769\nTax\n(6,499)\n(7,583)\n(14,083)\nEBITDA\n302,716\n183,404\n666,311\nOutlook and Current Trading\nB90 enters the second half of 2025 in its strongest position to date. We have a lean, scalable, and profitable business model; a growing and diversified network of global partners; and a highly focused team aligned around performance and growth. With market expectations reaffirmed in our July 2025 trading update, we remain confident in delivering a strong full-year result at both revenue and EBITDA level.\nOur priorities for the remainder of the year include expanding revenue from existing marketing assets, securing additional high-margin partnerships, unlocking new geographies, and continuing to invest in performance-driven technology. The second half of the year traditionally benefits from peak activity in both sports and casino, trends already reflected in current trading, giving us additional confidence in our outlook.\nJuly and August 2025 delivered record-breaking monthly revenues for the Group and a corresponding strong EBITDA performance, underlining the strength of our model and the momentum with which we enter the remainder of the year.\nWe remain focused on driving profitable growth, strengthening partner relationships, and creating sustained value for shareholders.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our shareholders, partners, and team for their continued support. We move forward with confidence, momentum, and a clear strategy for long-term success.\nRonny Breivik\nExecutive Chairman22 September 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nUNAUDITED\nPeriod ended\nUNAUDITED\nPeriod ended\nAUDITED\nYear ended\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nRevenue\n2,407,483\n1,379,178\n3,521,834\nMarketing and selling expense\n(986,287)\n(181,370)\n(753,064)\nSalary expense\n(816,368)\n(841,940)\n(1,591,191)\nOther administrative expense\n(368,448)\n(303,439)\n(731,037)\nAmortisation and impairment expense\n(282,102)\n(381,966)\n(2,162,039)\nTotal administrative expenses\n(2,453,205)\n(1,708,715)\n(5,237,331)\nOperating loss\n(45,722)\n(329,537)\n(1,715,497)\nTaxation\n6,499\n7,583\n14,083\nLoss for the period\n(39,223)\n(321,954)\n(1,701,414)\nLoss per share attributable to equity holders of the Company\n- Basic (in \u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0164)\n- Diluted (in \u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0164)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nUNAUDITED\nUNAUDITED\nAUDITED\nYear ended\n6 months ended\nYear ended\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nNon-current assets\nGoodwill\n1,913,600\n1,913,600\n1,913,600\nOther intangible assets\n4,880,248\n6,942,423\n5,162,350\nTotal non-current assets\n6,793,848\n8,856,023\n7,075,950\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n1,010,011\n503,553\n704,374\nCash and cash equivalents\n401,206\n302,104\n364,259\nTotal current assets\n1,411,217\n805,657\n1,068,633\nTotal assets\n8,205,065\n9,661,680\n8,144,583\nEquity and liabilities\nShare capital\n-\n-\n-\nAdditional paid-in capital\n41,170,466\n41,110,393\n41,170,466\nReverse asset acquisition reserve\n(6,046,908)\n(6,046,908)\n(6,046,908)\nRetained earnings\n(28,480,624)\n(27,217,071)\n(28,507,737)\nTotal shareholders' equity\n6,642,934\n7,846,414\n6,615,821\nNon-current liabilities\nDeferred tax liability\n213,345\n226,345\n219,845\nTotal non-current liabilities\n213,345\n226,345\n219,845\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n1,348,786\n1,588,921\n1,308,917\nTotal current liabilities\n1,348,786\n1,588,921\n1,308,917\nTotal equity and liabilities\n8,205,065\n9,661,680\n8,144,583\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nAdditional\nOther reserves -\nShare\npaid in\nReverse asset\nRetained\ncapital\ncapital\nacquisition reserve\nearnings\nTotal\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nBalance as at 1 January 2024\n-\n41,110,393\n(6,046,908)\n(27,026,092)\n8,037,393\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(321,954)\n(321,954)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n130,975\n130,975\nBalance as at 30 June 2024\n-\n41,110,393\n(6,046,908)\n(27,217,071)\n7,846,414\nBalance as at 1 January 2024\n-\n41,110,393\n(6,046,908)\n(27,026,092)\n8,037,393\nResult for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(1,701,414)\n(1,701,414)\nConversion of liabilities\n-\n45,000\n-\n-\n45,000\nExercise of stock options\n-\n15,073\n-\n-\n15,073\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n219,769\n219,769\nBalance as at 31 December 2024\n-\n41,170,466\n(6,046,908)\n(28,507,737)\n6,615,821\nResult for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(39,223)\n(39,223)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n66,336\n66,336\nBalance as at 30 June 2025\n-\n41,170,466\n(6,046,908)\n(28,480,624)\n6,642,934\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash flows from operating activities\nOperating loss\n(45,722)\n(329,537)\n(1,715,497)\nAdjustments for:\nShare based payments\n66,336\n130,975\n219,769\nImpairments of intangible assets\n-\n-\n1,398,107\nAmortisation of intangibles\n282,102\n381,966\n763,932\nCash flow generated from operations before working capital changes\n302,716\n183,404\n666,311\n(Increase) in trade and other receivables\n(305,638)\n(15,568)\n(216,389)\nIncrease/(decrease) in trade and other payables\n39,870\n(694,847)\n(929,851)\nCash flow used in operations\n36,948\n(527,011)\n(479,929)\nTax (paid)/received\n-\n-\n-\nCash flow used in operating activities\n36,948\n(527,011)\n(479,929)\nCash flow from financing activities\nProceeds of issue of new shares\n-\n-\n15,073\nNet cash inflow used in financing activities\n-\n-\n15,073\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n36,948\n(527,011)\n(464,856)\nCash and cash equivalents at start of period\n364,259\n829,115\n829,115\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n401,207\n302,104\n364,259\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n1. Basis of preparation\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of B90 Holdings plc (the \"Company\") and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) (collectively the \"Group\").\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited, do not constitute statutory accounts and were approved by the Board of Directors on 19 September 2025.\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nIn preparing the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024. The year ended 31 December 2024 Annual Report and financial statements is available on the Company's website (www.b90holdings.com).\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial information in this report has been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. IFRS is subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee and there is an ongoing process of review and endorsement by the European Commission. These policies are consistent with those to be adopted in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2025.\nThe Group has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Statements\" in preparing the interim financial information.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties of the Group have not changed since the last annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, where a detailed explanation of such risks and uncertainties can be found.\nGoing concern\nThe Group reported a net loss of \u20ac0.04 million for the six months ended 30 June 2025, with a positive EBITDA of \u20ac0.30 million. The Group reported a positive cash flow from operations of \u20ac0.04 million.\nTrading during H1 2025 was in line with the Board's expectations and shows further improvement from 2024. The Group also shows a positive working capital position of \u20ac0.06 million. The Directors believe the Group will meet the full year expectations. However, should revenue not be in line with management's expectations going forward, the Group's ability to meet its liabilities may be impacted, in which case the Group may need to raise further funding. In the event that further funds are needed, whilst the directors are confident of being able to raise such funding if required, there is no certainty that such funding will be available and/or the terms of such funding. These conditions are necessarily considered to represent a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWhilst acknowledging this uncertainty, the Directors remain confident that the current strategy will allow the Group to expand its operations and generate a positive operational cash flow within a reasonable time or, if needed, be able to raise additional funding when required; therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis. These financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\n2. Earnings per share\nThe calculation of earnings per share is based on the following earnings and number of shares.\n6 months\nended\n30 June 2025\n6 months\nended30 June 2024\nYear ended31 December 2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nEarnings\nLoss for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per shares being net result attributable to equity shareholders\n(39,223)\n(321,954)\n(1,715,497)\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share\n440,814,739\n439,518,227\n439,782,993\nWeighted average number of dilutive share options\n-\n-\n-\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share\n440,814,739\n439,518,227\n439,782,993\nBasic loss per share (\u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0039)\nDiluted loss per share (\u20ac)\n(0.0001)\n(0.0007)\n(0.0039)\n3. Significant events during the reporting period\nOn 30 June 2025, the Company announced that it had granted a total of 22,000,000 options over ordinary shares to directors and employees of the Company. These options have an exercise price of 3p and will vest in equal instalments over the years following the first anniversary of the grant date. The options expire after 8 years.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
