As previously communicated in the 2024 interim accounts and recent fact sheets, Vision and their advisers have been negotiating the FCVS RJ credits through the government system and have achieved some success. Over 80% of the credits in the portfolio which were approved by Caixa and officially handed over to the Treasury have now been novated. Having signed a novation contract with the Treasury, the related cash and bonds have been deposited into the V3 FIDC securities account.\nA further tranche remains under review by the Treasury, and this may transition through to novation in the next several months.\nWith respect to the first novated tranche, Vision will now work with tax lawyers, service providers and the independent directors to determine and execute the following:\n-\nthe fiscal deductions that need to be settled in Brazil;\n-\nthe distribution waterfall approval;\n-\ndirectors' resolution approval;\n-\nexecution of FIDC amortization;\n-\nexecution of FX transaction;\n-\ntransfer of funds among intermediate offshore vehicles; and\n-\nsending notice of redemption to the Cayman administrator (Suntera); and\n-\nFinally the joint authorization from Vision and Suntera for payment on behalf of each investor.\nVision estimates that the above steps will take approximately one month to complete. With respect to the waterfall of payments, we expect the V Invest RJ Loan to be settled in full first (ALF's share being circa US$2.67mlm), followed by the repayment of the recent US$3mln recapitalisation loan. The balance will then be distributed to all shareholders.\nALF owns 21.5% of the Vision RJ Fund and using an approximate estimate for the expected deductions that are listed above, we anticipate that ALF should receive a figure roughly equivalent to Vision's March 31, NAV for the RJ Fund. This was US$14.88mln.\nWe would like to re-iterate that this recovery estimate is an indicative guideline only. At this point we do not have accurate data with respect to the deductions listed above. Consequently, the recovery number could increase or decrease.\nBased on the estimated timeline received from Vision, it is possible that this exercise could be completed prior to the end of August, however, accurate timing is difficult to ascertain at this point.\nOnce funds have been received, the Board will determine the appropriate amount of cash to be distributed through redeemable B shares. The Board will also take soundings from shareholders with a view to making recommendations with respect to the remaining assets in the portfolio.\nEnquiries\nTim Gardner, Hindsight Solutions Limited\nTel. +44 7917 630 460\nEmail:\ntimgardner@hindsightsolutions.co.uk\nWebsite:\nhttps://alternativeliquidityfund.com/\nApex Fund and Corporate Services (Guernsey) Limited\nTelephone: +44 (0) 20 3530 3111\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

On the balance sheet, there was no debt, with net assets at \u00a34.88 million.\r\n\r\nWhile revenue and profits for the current year are expected to be lower than the comparable period a year earlier at APIS -  due to investment in personnel and infrastructure - they are in-line with expectations.

As such they are also highly profitable, delivering excellent margins. On a historical basis the two firms made combined net profits of around \u00a31.83 million in 2010, thus, at the current market cap the earnings multiple is just 6.25 times. For a business with a solid balance sheet, extra funding from the IPO and a clear growth strategy that looks like a good price to us. Buy.",

With the shares at 67.5p the specialist real estate insurance broker is capitalised at \u00a311.42 million. \r\n\r\nOperations\r\n\r\nThe group brings together two specialist commercial real estate insurance brokers, APIS and ICP, which focus on managing the insurance needs of large, international property portfolios. The small team delivers a tailored, professional service founded on a deep understanding of commercial real estate markets developed over many years.\r\n\r\nAPIS, which was established in 2007 by Gary Field together with Timothy Allan and Rold Allan of Allan Properties, operates a loyalty scheme that offers prominent potential stakeholder investors (with control over significant real estate portfolios and related insurance premiums) equity participation in a vehicle in return for committing to place insurance through the group. The APIS business model is based on having fewer large clients, with minimum premiums in excess of \u00a3100,000, supported by industry recognised technology and retaining clients through good service management.\r\n\r\nICP, which was originally a subsidiary of Lee Baron, a major property management company, offers both UK and European insurance coverage to its predominantly high premium clients. The group has invested in industry recognised insurance broking software and it is anticipated that ICP\u2019s data will be transferred to the group\u2019s systems as soon as possible after completion of the acquisition.",
