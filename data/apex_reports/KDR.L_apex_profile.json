ODM is a specialised laboratory for testing diamondiferous kimberlite indicator minerals.\nThe targets sampled were up-ice from the location of the green diamond discovery along a kimberlite indicator mineral train and were identified by geophysics and kimberlitic indicator analysis.\nSamples from the two locations returned anomalous concentrations of\nthirty-six purple to red peridotitic garnets\n(G9/10 Cr-pyropes garnets). Six of the peridotitic garnets were in the large range\n(0.5 to 1.0mm size\n). Partial alteration mantles, otherwise referred to as \"Kelyphitic rims\", were present on the peridotitic garnets. Kelyphitic rims are fragile and tend not be preserved on the peridotitic garnets if they have been transported any large distance.\nThe presence of G9/10 peridotitic garnets indicates that the material sampled has been derived from the diamond stability field where diamonds are formed.\nThe number and size of the peridotitic garnets, and the presence of Kelyphitic rims, suggests close proximity to a kimberlite source, from which the green diamond may have been derived.\nOrange mantle garnets\nwere also present in samples from these two locations. Orange mantle garnets can include eclogitic pyrope almandine garnets (G3) which, if present, are significant, as they tend to be associated with richer diamond grades. These orange mantle garnets will be tested in due course to establish whether or not eclogitic mantle materials are present.\nKimberlite indicator minerals were absent in locations further up-ice from the two anomalous locations. This, together with geophysical data, suggests that the kimberlite indicator mineral train, up-ice from the green diamond discovery, ends at an electromagnetic geophysical anomaly within which the kimberlite source of the green diamond may be located.\nGiven that indicator minerals were not present in samples further up ice, the positive sample result provides further evidence that the green diamond kimberlite source is closer to and within our targeted area.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nFurther results will be issued as the programme progresses.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"These results are most encouraging and are a major step forward in the Company's diamond exploration programme, in the highly prospective Kuhmo region. They also suggest that we may be getting very close to locating the source of the green diamond which the Company discovered.\n\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3895759_0.jpeg"

Results from a subsequent stream sediment sampling programme indicated high prospectivity for Nickel/Copper/Platinum Group Metals and a highly anomalous area was outlined.\nWe look forward to 2024 with optimism.\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3897606_0.jpeg"

During the period the Company advanced its prospects in both Finland and Ireland.\nHighlights of the period included:\nThe long-awaited decision regarding mine boundaries for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit in Finland was received. It is the Company\u2019s intention to move through the development stage and on to production and the Company is focussed on securing appropriate strategic investment to this end.\nFollowing analysis of basal till samples excavated at various target locations in the Kuhmo region of Finland a semi-airborne unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey was completed and the data resulting from this survey was processed. The geophysical interpretation of the data identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the kimberlitic source of the green diamond. A follow up drilling programme when weather conditions suit is planned.\nA number of interlinking new licences and licence extensions have also been obtained in the Kuhmo area.\nThe Company\u2019s exploration programme for Nickel, Copper and Platinum-Group Elements in Northern Ireland, with licences covering 750Km\u00b2, adds a significant important supplement to the Company\u2019s diamond programme in Finland.\nThe Company has identified the site of the historic Cappagh Copper Mine in Northern Ireland as a significant new copper target for investigation within its KDR 4 licence area.\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman of Karelian, said:\n\u201cThe Company has again made progress towards developing its targets in both Finland and Ireland and it is the Board\u2019s intention to now accelerate the pace of the work, particularly in Finland where we have the opportunity to move towards the development of a producing diamond mine.\u201d\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements for the year to 31 May 2025\nThe full audited annual report and financial statements for the year to 31 May 2025 has been posted to shareholders and will be published on the Company's website (\nwww.kareliandiamondresources.com\n) shortly.\nKey elements can also be viewed at the bottom of this announcement.\nAnnual General Meeting\nThe Annual General Meeting of the Company (\"\nAGM\n\") will be held at The Radisson Blu St. Helen\u2019s Hotel, Stillorgan Road, Blackrock, Dublin at 12 noon on Wednesday 17 December 2025.\nA copy of the notice of AGM has been posted to shareholders and can be viewed on the Company's website.\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+ 44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI am pleased to present the Company\u2019s Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2025, a year which saw progress on our projects in both Finland and Northern Ireland.\nThe Lahtojoki Diamond Deposit\nDuring the year the Company was granted a mining concession certificate by Tukes which formally entitles the Company to utilise the minerals within the mining concession.\nThis was a critical milestone for your Company as it allows the Company to proceed with its plans to bring in a mine at Lahtojoki.\nThe Lahtojoki mining project comprises a mining concession covering 71 hectares (c. 176 acres), including a kimberlite pipe with a surface area of 1.6 hectares (c.4 acres).\nSince its\u2019 initial purchase of the project over eight years ago, the Company has been steadily working with the relevant authorities to achieve the various milestones required for the granting of a mining concession certificate by Tukes.\nNow that this has been received, focus has turned to securing appropriate strategic investment to take this project through the development stage and on to production.\nI do not expect this to be easy, however with the presence of fancy diamonds, including pink diamonds, and also the potential for the mine to act as a hub for other developments by your Company in the area, I believe the Company is an attractive proposition as the first diamond mine in Europe outside of Russia.\nDiamond Exploration in the Kuhmo Region",

Further operational progress was made by Karelian during the period, while the final approval for the proposed diamond mine remains awaited.\nHighlights of the half-year period included:\nLahtojoki diamond mine boundaries were finalised with no change to the existing boundaries. Landowner compensation agreed and paid. Final approval on the three outstanding items is expected in H2 2025.\nExploration programme in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\ncontinues with a follow-up detailed electromagnetic survey conducted over the target area which has identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the kimberlitic source of the green diamond.\nNew licence areas and extensions of existing ones have been granted over, and adjacent to, the target areas in\nFinland\n.\nIn\nNorthern Ireland\nexpert assessment on the nickel, copper and platinum anomalies have proven very encouraging as being capable of hosting significant economic deposits and as a result further work is being carried out.\nBrendan McMorrow\n, Chairman of Karelian Diamonds, said:\n\u201cThe Company has made further progress in the period, especially with regards to the granting of the mining permit at the Lahtojoki diamond deposit.

A hearing of the Finnish Land Court resulted in no change to the existing boundaries. This decision was an essential and long-awaited step as the Company proceeds with its plans for the proposed development of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit.\nAdditionally, the appeals by two landowners regarding the terms were rejected by the Land Court, except for three minor items. The Company has been informed that these will be determined in the next quarter.\nDiamond Exploration Programme in\nFinland\nThe Company\u2019s exploration programme in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\ncontinues to be encouraging up-ice of the Company\u2019s discovery of a green diamond. Basal till sampling suggests that two of the sample locations may be close to the source of the green diamond.\nA follow-up semi-airborne unmanned aerial vehicle (\u201cUAV\u201d) based detailed electromagnetic (\u201cEM\u201d) survey has been conducted over the target area. A UAV-based EM survey is a geophysical method used to map the electrical conductivity of the subsurface.\nAs announced on\n24 January 2025\n, the geophysical interpretation of the electromagnetic data has identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the kimberlitic source of the green diamond (and the indicator mineral fan).\nThe anomalies are up-ice of the two highly anomalous basal till sample locations documented in the pitting programme carried out in 2023 (announced by the Company on\n19 December 2023\n) and the green diamond previously discovered in till by the Company (as announced by the Company on\n31 January 2017\n).\nSeveral new licences and licence extensions have been obtained in the area.\nAs announced on\n7 February 2025\n, the Company has applied for, and been granted, a new reservation, Kuumu 1, at Lentiira in northern Kuhmo, 30 kilometres to the north of the Company\u00b4s green diamond discovery (announced by Karelian on\n31 January 2017\n).

A total of\nseventy-four purple to red peridotitic garnets\n(G9/G10 pyropes), nine of which in the large range (0.5 to 1.0 mm size),\ntwo orange mantle garnets\n,\nfour chrome diopsides\nand\neighty-one chromites\nwere discovered.\nThe highest KIM counts were achieved in three highly anomalous basal till samples, containing a total of fifty-nine purple to red peridotitic garnets, two orange mantle garnets and nineteen chromites. The fourth-best KIM count was achieved in a surface till sample, also including one pyrope of the large range.\nPartial alteration mantles, referred to as \"kelyphitic rims\", were present on fifteen peridotitic garnets of the three highly anomalous basal till samples. The kelyphitic rims indicate a relatively short transportation distance from a kimberlitic source, as do the number and size of peridotitic garnets in the same basal till samples as well as in one surface till sample.\nOne highly anomalous sample contained orange mantle garnets which are likely to be eclogitic, based on the results of adjacent samples taken in 2023. Eclogitic garnets tend to be associated with better diamond grades. All the garnets will be tested by electron microprobe for further classification.\nTill locating any further up-ice cannot be sampled by excavation because the thickness of overburden, especially peat on top of till, increases considerably in a swampy area to the north-west of the last sampling point. As a result, the most necessary next step is to drill. Combined with the recent results of the semi-airborne UAV-based electromagnetic survey, the kimberlite indicator mineral analysis, updated with the current results, significantly limits the area to be targeted for drilling.\nMaureen Jones\n, Managing Director of Karelian Diamond Resources PLC, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by further excellent kimberlite indicator mineral results highlighting the recently electromagnetic anomaly as a potential source of the green diamond.\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources PLC\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n4112326_0.jpeg",

The reservation provides a one-year privilege to apply for an exploration permit in the area.\nThe Lentiira area is considered highly prospective by the Company. Several orangeite dikes with highly prospective indicator mineral compositions were discovered in the area by European Diamonds PLC in the early 2000s, and diamonds were discovered by till sampling in a number of locations.\nConsidering the fact that the ultimate sources of the main indicator fans still remain unlocated, the exploration possibilities for the Company in the Lentiira area are intriguing.\nThe Company has submitted an application to TUKES for an uninterrupted extension of the exploration permit, Kuhmo 1, where a follow-up excavation programme was recently completed up-ice of the green diamond discovery (as announced by the Company on\n25 September 2024\n).\nThe results of this programme are expected in the first quarter of 2025. The Company plans to continue its exploration programme in the Kuhmo region in 2025 focussing in particular on the green diamond target area where a high priority drilling target has already been identified from the detailed electromagnetic survey conducted over the Company's green diamond target area, the results of which were announced on\n24 January 2025\n.\nThe exploration permit, Seitaper\u00e4, covering the Seitaper\u00e4 diamondiferous kimberlite (orangeite) in Kuhmo, circa 6 kilometres to the southwest of the exploration permit Kuhmo 1, has been extended for a further 3 year period by TUKES in\nMarch 2024\n. Karelian has shown the Seitaper\u00e4 kimberlite to be the largest known kimberlite in\nFinland\n, extending over a surface area of 6.9 hectares.\nAs announced by the Company on\n25 January 2024\n, extensions for the exploration permits, Riihivaara 26, Riihivaara 24, 24A and\n24B\nin Kuhmo, were granted by TUKES for further 3 years from\nJanuary 2024\n.\nThe Riihivaara 26 exploration permit covers Karelian Diamond's kimberlite (olivine lamproite) discovery at Riihivaara, circa 10 kilometres to the south of the exploration permit Kuhmo 1.\nAll of the above-mentioned Karelian licence areas in Kuhmo, combined with the new reservation extending the area of interest north to Lentiira, may together prove to become a significant diamond province on the Finnish side of the Karelian Craton.\nIn addition, new exploration permits at Liperi, in the Joensuu region of\nEastern Finland\n, and Salla, in Lapland of\nFinland\n, have been recently granted.\nLahtojoki Diamond Deposit\nThe Company expects to finalise all outstanding aspects of the landowner compensation in the second quarter of 2025. As set out in the Company's announcement of\n18 October 2024\nthe decision of the Land Court has now gained legal force with only three matters remaining to be finalised with the National Land Survey. The court hearing was in relation to appeals by two landowners regarding amounts of compensation to be paid to them and the mine boundary itself at the Company's proposed mine development at Lahtojoki, in the Kuopio Kaavi region of\nFinland\n.\nA mining concession application for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit has already been approved by TUKES.\nThe Company is reaching out to potential strategic partners to advance the Company's proposed development of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit.\nFinalisation of the mine boundary and landowner compensation is an essential step in progressing this development.\nNorthern Ireland Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Metals Projects\nAn assessment prepared by independent geological consultant, Dr\nLarry Hulbert\n, announced on\n24 June 2024\n, confirms the potential for Nickel, Copper, and Platinum-Group Elements (\"PGE\"), in the Company's license areas in\nNorthern Ireland\n, following the discovery by the Company of indicator minerals for Nickel, Copper and PGE, during the course of a stream sediment sampl",

A UAV-based EM survey is a geophysical method used to map the electrical conductivity of the subsurface.\nThe geophysical interpretation of electromagnetic data has identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the kimberlitic source of the green diamond (and the indicator mineral fan) that is the focus of the Company's exploration in the area.\nThe anomalies are up-ice of the two highly anomalous basal till sample locations documented in the pitting programme carried out in 2023 (announced by the Company on\n19 December 2023\n) and the green diamond previously discovered in till by the Company (as announced by the Company on\n31 January 2017\n).\nThe 3D resistivity mesh model obtained from the inversion of the EM data, from three layers (at the depths of 10 metres, 60 metres and 110 metres below the surface), reveal a weak (resistivity > 300-1000\n\uf057\nm) but confined pipe-like conductivity anomaly, located to the northwest of the Company's existing Kimberlite Indicator Mineral (\"KIM\") fan.\nAt increasing depths, another smaller conductivity anomaly appears close to the former.\nWeak electromagnetic anomalies are typically related to certain zones of kimberlites or lamproites which can be highly weathered into clay minerals at the surface. Combined with the Company's existing high resolution magnetic data, there is a negative magnetic anomaly overlapping with the main EM anomaly of the 3D resistivity model. The Company is classifying the resultant target as a high priority for drilling and has incorporated the testing of this target into its plans for 2025.\nThe semi-airborne EM survey was carried out using specialised measurement equipment created by\nRadai Oy\n, attached to a UAV. In this specialised EM measurement system, the aerial device tows an EM receiver approximately 30 metres behind it. The receiver, together with a transmitter located on the ground, is capable of measuring the electrical conductivity of the ground and bedrock.\nThe EM survey was flown on a Northeast-Southwest orientation with 38 flight lines at 50 metres spacing and 5 Northwest-Southeast tie-lines 500 metres apart at a height of circa 40 metres. The survey comprised 70 line-kilometres, covering an area of 3 km\n2\n.\nThe survey was made using multiple transmitter loop locations, making the total length of flights over 600 kilometres.\nMaureen Jones\n, Managing Director of Karelian, commented:\n\"We are delighted that this new innovative UAV geophysical survey has been so successful in the identification of a\ndiatreme shape kimberlite target\nand possible source of the green diamond. This kimberlite target is further supported by the kimberlite indicator mineral fan, making it a very exciting and high priority drilling target.\nWe look forward to progressing our exploration programmes both in\nNorthern Ireland\nand\nFinland\nin addition to moving the Lahtojoki mining project forward as it moves to the next phase.\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources PLC\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n4095464_0.jpeg",

Details of these can be found below and a full copy of the Annual Results can be viewed on the Company\u2019s website.\nDuring the period progress was made in developing the Company\u2019s prospects in both\nFinland\nand\nIreland\n.\nHighlights of the period included:\nThe long awaited decision regarding mine boundaries for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit were finalised, post year end, at a hearing of the Finnish Land Court resulting in no change to the existing boundaries. This decision was an essential step as the Company proceeds with its plans for the proposed development of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit.\nAdditionally, regarding the appeals by two landowners the majority of the items were rejected by the Land Court. Three items were referred back to the Land Survey to review.\nAnalysis of basal till samples excavated at various target locations in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\n, suggests that the Company\u2019s search for the source of the green diamond the Company discovered has narrowed, with garnets, identified in two sample locations. This suggests close proximity to a kimberlite source\n.\nThe Company\u2019s exploration programme for Nickel, Copper and Platinum - Group Elements in\nNorthern Ireland\nadds a significant, exciting and possibly very important wing to the Company\u2019s diamond exploration and development programme in Finland. The Company now holds three prospecting licences, totalling an area of approximately 750Km\u00b2, in\nNorthern Ireland\n.\nSamples from a stream sediment sampling programme over the prospecting licences dispatched for analysis and an independent assessment carried out.\nBrendan McMorrow\n, Chairman of Karelian, said:\n\u201cI have pleasure in presenting the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2024. However, it is also tinged with great sadness as I do so following the passing of our founder and Executive Chairman, Professor\nRichard Conroy\n. It now falls to myself and the team to continue Richard\u2019s work and I look forward with confidence to continued success for the Company both in\nFinland\n, where we are looking to open a diamond mine, and in\nNorthern Ireland\nwhere we have potential Nickel, Copper and Platinum - Group Elements deposits.\u201d\nAnnual Report and Accounts for the year to\n31 May 2024\nThe full audited annual report and accounts for the year to\n31 May 2024\nhas been posted to shareholders and will be published on the Company's website (\nwww.kareliandiamondresources.com\n) shortly. Key elements can also be viewed at the bottom of this announcement.\nAnnual General Meeting\nThe Annual General Meeting of the Company (\"AGM\") will be held at The Conrad Dublin Hotel, Earlsfort Terrace,\nDublin\nat\n12.30pm\non\n18 December 2024\n.

However it is also tinged with great sadness as I do so following the passing of our founder and Executive Chairman, Professor\nRichard Conroy\nafter a brief illness.\nRichard\u2019s accomplishments across the diverse range of medicine, politics and indeed mineral exploration garnered respect from all. His entrepreneurial and inquiring spirit was excited by the opportunities in mine exploration and development, and his skills, honed in zinc and gold projects in\nIreland\n, spread to\nFinland\nwhere his vision of the Karelian Craton having the potential for a significant European diamond mine is being steadily realised by the Company. Equally, the Company\u2019s recent progress on its Copper, Nickel and Platinum-Group Elements project in\nNorthern Ireland\nheld true to his belief in the potential of\nIreland\nto provide a European solution to the shortfall in critical minerals necessary for a modern economy. In Karelian Diamond Resources, we intend to continue to build on his substantial legacy and deliver on Richard\u2019s vision for the company.\nThe Lahtojoki Dia",

Brendan was appointed to the Board of the Company as a non-executive director on\n15 November 2018\n. He assumes leadership of the Board following the death of Company founder and Executive Chairman, Professor\nRichard Conroy\n, last month.\nProfessor Conroy as Executive Chairman had led the Company for many years and has left it with a very strong foundation including diamond exploration and development opportunities in\nFinland\nand copper, nickel and platinum group metal exploration licences in\nNorthern Ireland\n. These projects offer significant upside value and opportunity for the Company and its shareholders.\nUpdate on current activity\nDiamond exploration and development projects in\nFinland\nThe Karelian craton, which extends across\nFinland\n, is one of the largest cratons in the world and has been proven to contain world class diamond deposits.\nThe presence of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit confirms that the Finnish section of the Karelian craton is diamondiferous, and the size of the Karelian craton in\nFinland\nsuggests the potential for the occurrence of a world class diamond deposit.\nLahtojoki Diamond Deposit\nKarelian's acquisition of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit in the Kuopio - Kaavi region of\nFinland\nwas driven by the Company's experience in diamond exploration. A preliminary economic assessment carried out by the Company in 2017 suggested that 2.11 million carats would be recoverable from the mine. The presence of pink diamonds at Lahtojoki is significant and could have a considerable effect on the profitability of a mine as they command a substantially higher price than colourless diamonds (up to twenty times higher).\nAnalyst calculations based on a 3% pink diamond content at Lahtojoki estimated a net present value for the project of\n$69 million\nat an 8% discount rate.\nThe Company has been progressing the project steadily towards the granting of a mining concession.\nThe last step in this process is the finalisation of landowner compensation.\nThe Land Survey decision in relation to this requirement was given in late 2023 and compensation paid in early 2024.\nTwo landowners appealed the decision in relation to aspects of the mine boundary and the quantum of compensation.\nThe mine boundaries for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit were finalised by the decision of the Finnish Land Court, announced on\n13 August 2024\n, resulting in no change to the existing boundaries.\nThe Court also held in the Company's favour on most of the matters raised in the appeal in relation to compensation with three remaining matters referred back to the Land Survey to review. The appellants were also required to contribute to the Company's legal costs.\nWith no further appeal having been lodged, the decision has now gained legal force.\nFollowing finalisation of these last matters regarding compensation the Company will progress to the development phase of this project.\nDiamond exploration programme\nThe Company is also active in an increasingly exciting diamond exploration programme in\nFinland\n.\nThe Company has carried out an extensive and systematic exploration programme for diamonds using,\ninter alia\n, geology, geophysics, kimberlitic indicator mineral trains, airborne and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) drone surveys together with excavation and drilling and the analysis of basal till samples. The programme has led to the previous discovery of a green diamond in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\n- the best possible kimberlitic indicator.\nAnalysis of basal till samples excavated at various target locations in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\n, suggests that the Company's search is narrowing for the source of the green diamond with the amount and type of garnets identified in sample locations suggesting a close proximity to a kimberlite source. Further work is ongoing in relation to this effort, the results of which will be released at the appropriate time.\nExploration for Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Metals in\nNorthern Ireland\nThe Company is carrying out an exploration programme for nickel, copper and platinum-group elements in\nNorthern Ireland\n.\nInitial results from this programme indicate a highly anomalous river catchment area. This area has yielded five samples each having over 1,000 indicator minerals. The indicator minerals are primarily Chromite and Forsterite with some Chalcopyrite.\nMicroprobe analysis on Chromite grains from samples taken ",

The indicator mineral train leads into a zone where there is the presence of an airborne electromagnetic anomaly. The recent pits were targeted as close as possible down-ice of this airborne electromagnetic anomaly zone which is believed to be a likely source for the kimberlitic indicator minerals and the green diamond. Six of the potential kimberlite targets previously identified by geophysics are located inside this same area. Many of the pits were placed exactly down-ice of these targets, one of them on a straight line up-ice from the location of the green diamond discovery along the indicator mineral train.\nGlacial till samples for kimberlite indicator mineral testing were collected in a total of twenty-one locations, fifteen of which were from basal till, five from medium layer till and one from surface till.\nEach glacial till sample consisted of three c. 30kg bags of glacial till. One of the bags was kept as a reference and two of the bags were passed through a 2 mm sieve, to produce 30 kg of sieved material for analysis. These sieved samples are to be dispatched to Overburden Drilling Management Limited (\"ODM\") in\nCanada\nfor kimberlite indicator mineral analysis.\nAfter receiving the results from ODM, the Company intends to follow up with a drilling programme in winter when the ground freezes and a drill rig can get on site. The results of the kimberlite indicator mineral analyses will provide critical information for targeting diamond drilling by further delineating the potential kimberlitic source area where any highly anomalous targets are to be tested.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"This has been a highly successful and very encouraging excavation programme which brings the Company ever closer to the discovery of the source of the Kuhmo green diamond.\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources PLC\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n4042378_0.jpeg",

With regards to the amount of compensation payable to the two landowners the majority of the items upon which they based their claims were rejected by the Finnish Land Court except for three items which were referred back to the National Land Survey to review. The appellants were also required to contribute to the Company's legal costs.\nA mining concession application for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit has already been approved by TUKES (the Finnish mining authority) and the National Land Survey has carried out the process in relation to ground rental compensation for the local landowners and the decided compensation has been paid by the Company. The current court hearing was to finalise the appeals by two of the landowners regarding the amount of compensation to be paid to them and also a change to the mine boundary.\nFinalisation of the mine boundaries is an essential step in relation to the Company's proposed development of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit.\nThe Board believes that the development of a diamond mine at Lahtojoki will not only bring significant benefits to the Company, but also to the entire surrounding Kuopio-Kaavi area.\nThe diamond mine at Lahtojoki, when in production, is expected to be the first diamond mine in the European Union.\nThe Lahtojoki diamond deposit, as well as containing high quality colourless gem diamonds, also contains pink diamonds and other coloured diamonds. Such diamonds are highly sought after and can command prices up to 20 times that of normal colourless gem diamonds.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman of Karelian Diamond Resources PLC, commented:\n\"We are pleased to receive the decision of the Finnish Land Court which brings finalisation to the establishment of the mine boundaries. We will await the completion of proceedings in relation to the compensation to the two landowners concerned.\n\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+44-20-7469-0930\n+ 44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n4023432_0.jpeg",

Dr Hulbert recommends that the Eagle deposit should serve as Karelian's exploration model.\nSimilarities were also noted to the continental flood basalts; i.e. Norilsk Russia (Triassic) and the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in\nChina\n, that also host world-class Ni-Cu-PGE deposits.\nIn the independent report Dr Hulbert commented \"what would have been considered as a low potential Ni-Cu-PGE exploration area in the past (pre-1995) have changed as a result of more recent discoveries and subsequent development of new exploration models. Recognition of similar geological and metallogenic environments, regardless of geological age, like that between the Proterozoic Baraga Basin Eagle mining camp setting and the KDR property is what will lead to new Ni-Cu-PGE discoveries. What was once not obvious is now obvious!\".\nA series of targets for Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Elements within the Company's licence area in\nNorthern Ireland\nwere identified by Dr Hulbert during the course of his review and recommended for follow up.\nDr Hulbert's review also included the establishment of a comprehensive data base incorporating geology, geochemistry, geophysics, remote sensing, and base Geographic Information System (GIS) information including TELLUS data and gravity geophysical data.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"Dr Hulbert's review is extremely encouraging. The geological similarities with areas associated with world class discoveries of Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Elements, such as the Eagle and Eagle East deposits is striking.\nThe review confirms the potential for the discovery of major Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Elements on Karelian's licences in\nNorthern Ireland\n.\nWe look forward to following up on the targets recommended by Dr Hulbert.\"\nFurther Information:\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n4005189_0.jpeg",

The results indicate the presence of a diamond stability field and, in turn, the presence of diamond bearing kimberlite likely to be the source of the diamond.\nDiscovery of the source of the green diamond could be particularly significant as coloured diamonds, including green diamonds, sell for prices which can be multiples of those for clear colourless diamonds.\nSixty garnets from a series of locations were submitted to Renaud Geological Consulting Ltd in\nCanada\nfor detailed Electron Microprobe Analysis, having been picked from till samples by Overburden Drilling Management Limited (\"ODM\") (as announced by the Company on\n19 December 2023\n).\nThe Microprobe analysis resulted in the identification of nineteen G10 (harzburgitic), nineteen G9 (lherzolitic), fifteen G5 (pyroxenitic) and seven G4 (eclogitic) garnets.\nThe presence of diamond stability field garnets (G10D) and other diamond-facies garnets (G4D and G5D) is a clear indicator of the diamond potential of the Kuhmo target area.

The period was one of steady progress, particularly in working towards opening the first diamond mine.\nHighlights of the half-year period included:\nThe proceedings to establish the mining concession for the applied for area at the Lahtojoki diamond deposit are now at an advanced stage.\nMining concession at Lahtojoki is expected to be approved, now the last of the compensation appeals are being finalised. This follows prior approvals by TUKES, the Finnish mining authority.\nExploration programme in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\ncontinues to be highly encouraging with results from basal till sampling suggesting that two of the sample locations may be close to the source of the green diamond the Company discovered.\nWork continues in\nNorthern Ireland\non the nickel, copper and platinum mineralisation anomalies.\nPost Period: 3 year extension granted for Exploration Permit covering the\nRiihivaara\nKimberlite discovery and adjacent areas.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman of Karelian, said:\n\u201cWe are very pleased\nwith\nthe Company\u2019s progress regarding the planned development of the mine at the Lahtojoki diamond deposit, the work to find the source of the green diamond and, post period, the extension of the exploration permits which will allow the Company to continue its work on the emerging kimberlite field at Kuhmo.\nOverall, it has been a very satisfactory period for the exploration team.\u201d\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI have great pleasure in presenting the Company\u2019s Half-Yearly Report and condensed Financial Statements for the half year ended\n30 November 2023\n.\nThe period was one of continued progress in relation to the development of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit in the Kuopio-Kaavi region of\nFinland\n. The proceedings to establish the mining concession are now at an advanced stage.\nA mining concession application has already been approved by TUKES (the Finnish mining authority). Following the order of TUKES, the National Land Survey has carried out the process in relation to ground rental compensation for the local landowners and is now finalising the appeals by two landowners regarding the amount of compensation and the mine boundary.\nLand possession for the duration of the mine is a major step forward in the Company\u2019s proposed development of the Lahtojoki deposit. The diamond mining project covers 71 hectares (c.176 acres) with the actual kimberlite pipe having a surface area of 16 hectares (c.40 acres).\nThe deposit, as well as containing high quality colourless gem diamonds, contains pink diamonds which are highly sought after and can command prices up to 20 times that of normal colourless gem diamonds.\nI believe the development of a diamond mine at Lahtojoki will not only bring significant benefits to the Company, but also to the entire surrounding Kuopio-Kaavi area and, when in production, is expected to be the first diamond mine in\nEurope\noutside\nRussia\n.\nThe Company\u2019s exploration programme in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\ncontinues to be highly encouraging up-ice of the Company\u2019s discovery of a green diamond. Results from the Company\u2019s basal till sampling suggest that two of the sample locations may be close to the source of the green diamond.\nThe Company\u2019s nickel, copper and platinum mineralisation exploration project in\nNorthern Ireland\nalso continues to be very encouraging.\nExercise of Warrants\nDuring the period the Company received warrant exercise notices to subscribe for a total of 600,000 new ordinary shares of nominal value \u20ac0.00025 each at an exercise price of\n2 pence\nper ordinary share, as announced by the Company on\n11 October 2023\n.\nFinance\nDuring the period there was a fundraising of \u00a3250,000 (including \u00a3100,000 from Board members) at\n2.5 pence\nper ordinary share.\nFollowing admission of these new ordinary shares, in relation to the fundraising and exercised warrants, the Com",

Exploration permits Riihivaara 24, 24a and\n24b\ncover the adjacent areas.\nThe Riihivaara permits are in an emerging kimberlite field, in which the Company has to date identified 20 regional anomalies.\nThe Company's kimberlite discovery at Riihivaara is circa 10 kilometres to the south of where the Company discovered a green diamond. As announced on\n19 December 2023\n, the search for the source of the green diamond has recently been narrowed down quite substantially through recent work undertaken by Karelian Diamonds .\nThe Riihivaara kimberlite comes to surface and extends for at least 350 metres. It is a dyke which remains open in both directions along strike with widths of up to two metres intersected. Drilling has already successfully intersected kimberlite at a deeper level and has also shown that the dyke dips at circa 50\u00b0 to the Northeast.\nMineral chemistry at the site shows that diamond indicator Group I eclogitic garnets are abundant and that diamond type chromites are also present\n.\nIlmenite analysis indicates a good diamond preservation index. Mineral chemistry also shows that more than one source may be present.\nIt is known that kimberlites tend to occur in clusters and that potentially diamondiferous sources may exist in the vicinity of the Riihivaara kimberlite. To this end Karelian Diamonds has also extended the Riihivaara 24, 24A and\n24B\nexploration permits.\nThe Company believes the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\nhas high prospectivity for diamondiferous kimberlites both through its own exploration results in the Kuhmo region, including the discovery of a green diamond, and also by the presence of the Seitaper\u00e4 diamondiferous kimberlite, circa 8 kilometres to the northwest of Riihivaara, which Karelian Diamonds has shown to extend over a surface area of 6.9Ha - the largest known kimberlite in\nFinland\n.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"The granting of the extension to the Riihivaara exploration permits enables the Company to continue and extend its exploration programme in this highly prospective area of\nFinland\n\".\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3915152_0.jpeg",

ODM is a specialised laboratory for testing diamondiferous kimberlite indicator minerals.\nThe targets sampled were up-ice from the location of the green diamond discovery along a kimberlite indicator mineral train and were identified by geophysics and kimberlitic indicator analysis.\nSamples from the two locations returned anomalous concentrations of\nthirty-six purple to red peridotitic garnets\n(G9/10 Cr-pyropes garnets). Six of the peridotitic garnets were in the large range\n(0.5 to 1.0mm size\n). Partial alteration mantles, otherwise referred to as \"Kelyphitic rims\", were present on the peridotitic garnets. Kelyphitic rims are fragile and tend not be preserved on the peridotitic garnets if they have been transported any large distance.\nThe presence of G9/10 peridotitic garnets indicates that the material sampled has been derived from the diamond stability field where diamonds are formed.\nThe number and size of the peridotitic garnets, and the presence of Kelyphitic rims, suggests close proximity to a kimberlite source, from which the green diamond may have been derived.\nOrange mantle garnets\nwere also present in samples from these two locations. Orange mantle garnets can include eclogitic pyrope almandine garnets (G3) which, if present, are significant, as they tend to be associated with richer diamond grades. These orange mantle garnets will be tested in due course to establish whether or not eclogitic mantle materials are present.\nKimberlite indicator minerals were absent in locations further up-ice from the two anomalous locations. This, together with geophysical data, suggests that the kimberlite indicator mineral train, up-ice from the green diamond discovery, ends at an electromagnetic geophysical anomaly within which the kimberlite source of the green diamond may be located.\nGiven that indicator minerals were not present in samples further up ice, the positive sample result provides further evidence that the green diamond kimberlite source is closer to and within our targeted area.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nFurther results will be issued as the programme progresses.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"These results are most encouraging and are a major step forward in the Company's diamond exploration programme, in the highly prospective Kuhmo region. They also suggest that we may be getting very close to locating the source of the green diamond which the Company discovered.\n\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3895759_0.jpeg",

ADD Palladium is not currently classified as a critical mineral in the UK's 2024 Criticality Assessment. However, it is part of the platinum group elements (PGEs) and is known for its use in catalytic converters, which help reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality. The United States has limited domestic production of palladium, primarily from the Stillwater Complex in Montana, but it does not meet national demand. The majority of the world's palladium supply comes from Russia and South Africa, making the U.S. highly dependent on foreign imports. Palladium is one of the most valuable precious metals, with prices often surpassing those of gold. The high demand from the automotive sector and supply chain vulnerabilities contribute to its market volatility. With rising concerns about supply disruptions, securing a domestic or allied-source supply has become an economic priority. criticalmineralsassociation.com",

The Kiviniemi property is located in the municipality of Rautalampi, Eastern Finland Province, approximately 350km northeast of Helsinki, by road.  The closest major city/airport is Kuopio (pop. 110,000), approximately 70km to the northeast of the property.   The exploration target is located on a small portion of a family farm, partially cleared for farming.  Most of the property is wooded, including the area where the mineralization has been located, Prior Exploration Work. The Geological Survey of Finland (\u201cGTK\u201d)  performed magnetic surveys on the general area in 1986, focused on copper/nickel/cobalt targets, and based on current mining activity in the area.    That initial field work located a significant magnetic anomaly on the Kiviniemi property.  In 2008, GTK initiated an exploration drilling program on the property, completing 4 diamond core holes in that first program phase, followed by a further 5 diamond holes in 2010, totaling 1,250 meters, at an average (angled) length of 139 meters, and a maximum vertical extension of 167 meters.  The drill spacing varied from 50-200 meters, using a diamond drill size of 46mm (T56). Four of the nine total holes drilled (approx. 850 meters) are in the mineralized area, with the remainder defining portions of the mag zone that did not contain scandium.  The mag zone is generally very high in iron, ranging from about 20% to 35% Fe.  The GTK published the results of the drill program assays, and other information on the geology and mineralization, on their website in 2016. Geology of Resource Target.  The host rock is very iron-rich, garnet-bearing fayalite ferro(monzo) diorite.  The main minerals in the deposit include: plagioclase, potassium feldspar, ferrohedenbergite  (clinopyroxene), ferrohastingsite (amphibole), almandine garnet and fayalite.",

The mining concession covers 71 hectares, including a kimberlite pipe with a surface area of 1.6 hectares. Following this regulatory approval, the company is now focused on securing strategic investment to advance the project through development and into production. In the Kuhmo region of Finland, Karelian\u2019s exploration work identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the source of a green diamond discovery. The company has classified these targets as high priority for drilling in its plans for the financial year ending May 2026. The company also expanded its portfolio with new licences in Finland\u2019s Lentiira area, approximately 30 kilometres north of the green diamond discovery site. These licences, along with extensions for existing permits covering the Seitaper\u00e4 diamondiferous kimberlite and Riihivaara kimberlite discovery, are valid until at least Q1 2027. In Northern Ireland, Karelian is exploring for nickel, copper, and platinum group elements across licences covering over 1,000 square kilometres. The company recently identified the historic Cappagh Copper Mine as a significant new target within its KDR 4 licence area. \ud83d\udcf0\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80bag \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",

          "content": "The Natural Diamond: Resilient Rarity and Ethical Premium For natural diamonds, 2026 is projected to see continued upward price pressure, particularly for high-quality, investment-grade stones. This appreciation is driven by two main factors: Constrained Supply: New mine discoveries remain economically and technologically challenging. As major mines in regions like Botswana and Canada approach maturity, the available supply of quality rough is diminishing. Industry forecasts suggest natural diamond prices could rise by up to 15% year-on-year, primarily due to this fundamental supply scarcity. The Ethical Imperative: The modern luxury consumer, especially in North America and Asia, demands provenance and sustainability. In 2026, a transparent, certified chain-of-custody is not a premium feature\u2014it is an expected cost of entry. The natural diamond sector is leveraging blockchain technology to provide satellite-verified proof of origin, reinforcing the value proposition of a rare, ancient, and responsibly-sourced product. This focus on \u201cclean,\u201d ethical sourcing will maintain a significant value premium over uncertified goods. The Investment Niche: Large, flawless stones (especially 4.00\u20135.99 carats, D-G color, VVS clarity or better) will remain highly sought after by institutional investors and collectors, functioning as a store of wealth amid global economic volatility. My Insight: The natural diamond must lean fully into its emotional and historical narrative. Its value in 2026 is less about being the \u2018only\u2019 option and entirely about being the \u2018rarest\u2019 and \u2018most meaningful\u2019 option\u2014a true legacy asset with an appreciating scarcity value.",

ADD Palladium is not currently classified as a critical mineral in the UK's 2024 Criticality Assessment. However, it is part of the platinum group elements (PGEs) and is known for its use in catalytic converters, which help reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality. The United States has limited domestic production of palladium, primarily from the Stillwater Complex in Montana, but it does not meet national demand. The majority of the world's palladium supply comes from Russia and South Africa, making the U.S. highly dependent on foreign imports. Palladium is one of the most valuable precious metals, with prices often surpassing those of gold. The high demand from the automotive sector and supply chain vulnerabilities contribute to its market volatility. With rising concerns about supply disruptions, securing a domestic or allied-source supply has become an economic priority. criticalmineralsassociation.com",

Rough diamond sales climbed more than 70% year-on-year to 17.7 million carats, while exports rose nearly 69% to 17.2 million carats. Revenues increased 21% compared to 2024, supported by rising production at the Luele mine and a shift away from stockpiling. Output from key assets including Luele, Catoca and Lulo was released through frequent sales cycles, prioritizing liquidity and market access over price recovery. High-volume buyers in the UAE, Belgium and Hong Kong absorbed much of the increased supply.",

The mining concession covers 71 hectares, including a kimberlite pipe with a surface area of 1.6 hectares. Following this regulatory approval, the company is now focused on securing strategic investment to advance the project through development and into production. In the Kuhmo region of Finland, Karelian\u2019s exploration work identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the source of a green diamond discovery. The company has classified these targets as high priority for drilling in its plans for the financial year ending May 2026. The company also expanded its portfolio with new licences in Finland\u2019s Lentiira area, approximately 30 kilometres north of the green diamond discovery site. These licences, along with extensions for existing permits covering the Seitaper\u00e4 diamondiferous kimberlite and Riihivaara kimberlite discovery, are valid until at least Q1 2027. In Northern Ireland, Karelian is exploring for nickel, copper, and platinum group elements across licences covering over 1,000 square kilometres. The company recently identified the historic Cappagh Copper Mine as a significant new target within its KDR 4 licence area. \ud83d\udcf0\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80bag \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",

          "content": "The Natural Diamond: Resilient Rarity and Ethical Premium For natural diamonds, 2026 is projected to see continued upward price pressure, particularly for high-quality, investment-grade stones. This appreciation is driven by two main factors: Constrained Supply: New mine discoveries remain economically and technologically challenging. As major mines in regions like Botswana and Canada approach maturity, the available supply of quality rough is diminishing. Industry forecasts suggest natural diamond prices could rise by up to 15% year-on-year, primarily due to this fundamental supply scarcity. The Ethical Imperative: The modern luxury consumer, especially in North America and Asia, demands provenance and sustainability. In 2026, a transparent, certified chain-of-custody is not a premium feature\u2014it is an expected cost of entry. The natural diamond sector is leveraging blockchain technology to provide satellite-verified proof of origin, reinforcing the value proposition of a rare, ancient, and responsibly-sourced product. This focus on \u201cclean,\u201d ethical sourcing will maintain a significant value premium over uncertified goods. The Investment Niche: Large, flawless stones (especially 4.00\u20135.99 carats, D-G color, VVS clarity or better) will remain highly sought after by institutional investors and collectors, functioning as a store of wealth amid global economic volatility. My Insight: The natural diamond must lean fully into its emotional and historical narrative. Its value in 2026 is less about being the \u2018only\u2019 option and entirely about being the \u2018rarest\u2019 and \u2018most meaningful\u2019 option\u2014a true legacy asset with an appreciating scarcity value.",

ADD Palladium is not currently classified as a critical mineral in the UK's 2024 Criticality Assessment. However, it is part of the platinum group elements (PGEs) and is known for its use in catalytic converters, which help reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality. The United States has limited domestic production of palladium, primarily from the Stillwater Complex in Montana, but it does not meet national demand. The majority of the world's palladium supply comes from Russia and South Africa, making the U.S. highly dependent on foreign imports. Palladium is one of the most valuable precious metals, with prices often surpassing those of gold. The high demand from the automotive sector and supply chain vulnerabilities contribute to its market volatility. With rising concerns about supply disruptions, securing a domestic or allied-source supply has become an economic priority. criticalmineralsassociation.com",

The current share price at 0.5p  is 1/70 of that  35p target price.   This is crazy undervalued and offers massive upside from here.  That my biased view of course, however, as the great prof always said\u2026.. \u201cthings can all change very quickly.\u201d   Whilst he is sadly no longer  with us, his vision for KDR remains.

I think that the next RNS will not just be that compensation finalised but will be partner news all bundled into one RNS. I may be wrong but the fact that a fundraise hasn\u2019t been done yet means that good news may be on the horizon.",

While the season runs from December to April, the deeper, more stable ice in mid-to-late winter provides the safest conditions for drilling. Optimal Timing: January, February, and March offer the best combination of thick, stable ice, sufficient snow cover, and increasing daylight hours compared to early winter. Safety & Conditions: By February and March, the ice is thick enough to support equipment and people, with ice thickness typically peaking in early April",

He continues to add to his holdings even though the company share price has never done him any favors, nor any of us for that matter.  Your constant bashing of the largest shareholder is very disrespectful, one has to wonder if the why you are so taken with hoops.  Just weird , and all here can see it for what it is.  Hoops,  you make an interesting point, it would be good to get some big money behind this, be it a financier or a mid tier .  DD, or somebody with a similar profile would fit the mould.   He is definitely smart enough, and must be aware of KDR, given that it\u2019s an Irish company.  I still think Canadian money will come in\u2026\u2026 certainly re Northern Ireland .",

          "content": "Diamond Tokenization To Be Minted On XRPL In a recent press release by Ctrl Alt, the company confirmed a historic partnership with Billiton Diamond to tokenize more than AED 1 billion ($280 million) worth of polished diamonds in Dubai. This collaboration aims to modernize the diamond industry by using blockchain technology to make diamond trading more transparent, secure, and efficient. The project focuses on turning physical diamonds into digital tokens that can be easily tracked, transferred, and verified on the blockchain. These tokenized assets are being minted on the XRP Ledger, a fast and low-cost blockchain network, while Ripple\u2019s enterprise-grade custody technology is being used to secure the assets. How Diamond Tokenization Will Change the Industry Traditionally, buying and selling diamonds has been a slow and complex process. Investors often face challenges such as limited transparency, high costs, and difficulty in verifying authenticity. Through tokenization, every diamond can now have a digital record showing its origin, grading, and ownership history. The company is also exploring ways to enable future trading of tokenized diamonds on primary and secondary markets.

I think that the next RNS will not just be that compensation finalised but will be partner news all bundled into one RNS.

He continues to add to his holdings even though the company share price has never done him any favors, nor any of us for that matter.  Your constant bashing of the largest shareholder is very disrespectful, one has to wonder if the why you are so taken with hoops.  Just weird , and all here can see it for what it is.  Hoops,  you make an interesting point, it would be good to get some big money behind this, be it a financier or a mid tier .  DD, or somebody with a similar profile would fit the mould.

This collaboration aims to modernize the diamond industry by using blockchain technology to make diamond trading more transparent, secure, and efficient. The project focuses on turning physical diamonds into digital tokens that can be easily tracked, transferred, and verified on the blockchain. These tokenized assets are being minted on the XRP Ledger, a fast and low-cost blockchain network, while Ripple\u2019s enterprise-grade custody technology is being used to secure the assets. How Diamond Tokenization Will Change the Industry Traditionally, buying and selling diamonds has been a slow and complex process. Investors often face challenges such as limited transparency, high costs, and difficulty in verifying authenticity. Through tokenization, every diamond can now have a digital record showing its origin, grading, and ownership history. The company is also exploring ways to enable future trading of tokenized diamonds on primary and secondary markets.

While the season runs from December to April, the deeper, more stable ice in mid-to-late winter provides the safest conditions for drilling. Optimal Timing: January, February, and March offer the best combination of thick, stable ice, sufficient snow cover, and increasing daylight hours compared to early winter. Safety & Conditions: By February and March, the ice is thick enough to support equipment and people, with ice thickness typically peaking in early April",

He continues to add to his holdings even though the company share price has never done him any favors, nor any of us for that matter.  Your constant bashing of the largest shareholder is very disrespectful, one has to wonder if the why you are so taken with hoops.  Just weird , and all here can see it for what it is.  Hoops,  you make an interesting point, it would be good to get some big money behind this, be it a financier or a mid tier .  DD, or somebody with a similar profile would fit the mould.   He is definitely smart enough, and must be aware of KDR, given that it\u2019s an Irish company.  I still think Canadian money will come in\u2026\u2026 certainly re Northern Ireland .",

This collaboration aims to modernize the diamond industry by using blockchain technology to make diamond trading more transparent, secure, and efficient. The project focuses on turning physical diamonds into digital tokens that can be easily tracked, transferred, and verified on the blockchain. These tokenized assets are being minted on the XRP Ledger, a fast and low-cost blockchain network, while Ripple\u2019s enterprise-grade custody technology is being used to secure the assets. How Diamond Tokenization Will Change the Industry Traditionally, buying and selling diamonds has been a slow and complex process. Investors often face challenges such as limited transparency, high costs, and difficulty in verifying authenticity. Through tokenization, every diamond can now have a digital record showing its origin, grading, and ownership history. The company is also exploring ways to enable future trading of tokenized diamonds on primary and secondary markets.

The mining concession certificate received from TUKES entitles the holder to utilise the minerals within the mining concession and the Company is now planning to proceed to the next stage of work on the mining concession area. Maureen Jones, Managing Director, commented: \"Confirmation of the registration of mining rights is a critical step for the Company and means that the Company can plan the next stage of work at the Lahtojoki Diamond Deposit.\" The Lahtojoki Diamond Deposit The Lahtojoki diamond mining project comprises a mining concession covering 71 hectares (c.176 acres) which includes a kimberlite pipe with a surface area of 16 hectares (c.40 acres). In addition to containing high quality colourless gem diamonds, the deposit also contains coloured diamonds including, in particular, pink diamonds which are highly sought after and can command prices up to 20 times that of normal coloured diamonds. The 2017 Preliminary Economic Assessment on the deposit, which excluded the impact on project revenue of the known potential for coloured diamonds, indicated 2+M carats recoverable with an in-situ value of US$211 million, and recommended an open/vertical pit mining operation.  This set the life-of-mine at over 9 years with payback by year two, an IRR of 55% and an NPV (at 8%) of US$ 39.1M.",

What can happen is shareholders collectively can demand a sale of the company or a sale of its parts .Ni Licences All diamond licences and Lahtojoki permit could raise 10 million minus its debts we could get 3P per share which would put most people here out with a small profit . Once theyve done the inevitable 0.3P placing shareholders need to take immediate action the bod either put the for sale sign up or they are removed and one is put up for them the alternative is lose the lot its in the hands of the major shareholders money back or nothing",

He continues to add to his holdings even though the company share price has never done him any favors, nor any of us for that matter.  Your constant bashing of the largest shareholder is very disrespectful, one has to wonder if the why you are so taken with hoops.  Just weird , and all here can see it for what it is.  Hoops,  you make an interesting point, it would be good to get some big money behind this, be it a financier or a mid tier .  DD, or somebody with a similar profile would fit the mould.

This collaboration aims to modernize the diamond industry by using blockchain technology to make diamond trading more transparent, secure, and efficient. The project focuses on turning physical diamonds into digital tokens that can be easily tracked, transferred, and verified on the blockchain. These tokenized assets are being minted on the XRP Ledger, a fast and low-cost blockchain network, while Ripple\u2019s enterprise-grade custody technology is being used to secure the assets. How Diamond Tokenization Will Change the Industry Traditionally, buying and selling diamonds has been a slow and complex process. Investors often face challenges such as limited transparency, high costs, and difficulty in verifying authenticity. Through tokenization, every diamond can now have a digital record showing its origin, grading, and ownership history. The company is also exploring ways to enable future trading of tokenized diamonds on primary and secondary markets.

A tiny fundraise of 185k was done last June so will likely have used most if not all of that up. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if very soon we head that a partner has been lined up. I think that the next RNS will not just be that compensation finalised but will be partner news all bundled into one RNS. I may be wrong but the fact that a fundraise hasn\u2019t been done yet means that good news may be on the horizon.",
