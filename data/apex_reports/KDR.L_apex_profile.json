During the period the Company advanced its prospects in both Finland and Ireland.\nHighlights of the period included:\nThe long-awaited decision regarding mine boundaries for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit in Finland was received. It is the Company\u2019s intention to move through the development stage and on to production and the Company is focussed on securing appropriate strategic investment to this end.\nFollowing analysis of basal till samples excavated at various target locations in the Kuhmo region of Finland a semi-airborne unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey was completed and the data resulting from this survey was processed. The geophysical interpretation of the data identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the kimberlitic source of the green diamond. A follow up drilling programme when weather conditions suit is planned.\nA number of interlinking new licences and licence extensions have also been obtained in the Kuhmo area.\nThe Company\u2019s exploration programme for Nickel, Copper and Platinum-Group Elements in Northern Ireland, with licences covering 750Km\u00b2, adds a significant important supplement to the Company\u2019s diamond programme in Finland.\nThe Company has identified the site of the historic Cappagh Copper Mine in Northern Ireland as a significant new copper target for investigation within its KDR 4 licence area.\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman of Karelian, said:\n\u201cThe Company has again made progress towards developing its targets in both Finland and Ireland and it is the Board\u2019s intention to now accelerate the pace of the work, particularly in Finland where we have the opportunity to move towards the development of a producing diamond mine.\u201d\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements for the year to 31 May 2025\nThe full audited annual report and financial statements for the year to 31 May 2025 has been posted to shareholders and will be published on the Company's website (\nwww.kareliandiamondresources.com\n) shortly.\nKey elements can also be viewed at the bottom of this announcement.\nAnnual General Meeting\nThe Annual General Meeting of the Company (\"\nAGM\n\") will be held at The Radisson Blu St. Helen\u2019s Hotel, Stillorgan Road, Blackrock, Dublin at 12 noon on Wednesday 17 December 2025.\nA copy of the notice of AGM has been posted to shareholders and can be viewed on the Company's website.\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+ 44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI am pleased to present the Company\u2019s Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2025, a year which saw progress on our projects in both Finland and Northern Ireland.\nThe Lahtojoki Diamond Deposit\nDuring the year the Company was granted a mining concession certificate by Tukes which formally entitles the Company to utilise the minerals within the mining concession.\nThis was a critical milestone for your Company as it allows the Company to proceed with its plans to bring in a mine at Lahtojoki.\nThe Lahtojoki mining project comprises a mining concession covering 71 hectares (c. 176 acres), including a kimberlite pipe with a surface area of 1.6 hectares (c.4 acres).\nSince its\u2019 initial purchase of the project over eight years ago, the Company has been steadily working with the relevant authorities to achieve the various milestones required for the granting of a mining concession certificate by Tukes.\nNow that this has been received, focus has turned to securing appropriate strategic investment to take this project through the development stage and on to production.\nI do not expect this to be easy, however with the presence of fancy diamonds, including pink diamonds, and also the potential for the mine to act as a hub for other developments by your Company in the area, I believe the Company is an attractive proposition as the first diamond mine in Europe outside of Russia.\nDiamond Exploration in the Kuhmo Region\nExploration work continues in the Kuhmo region of Finland where during the year, significantly, the geophysical interpretation of electromagnetic data from a UAV-based survey identified two diatreme-shaped anomalies that could represent the kimberlitic source of the green diamond that is the focus of the Company\u2019s exploration in the area. These two diatreme anomalies also have significant kimberlite indicator mineral fans down ice, with numerous Peridotitic garnets (G10 and G9) and even garnets from the diamond stability field (G10D) as well as Eclogitic garnets (G4) and the best indicator of all the green diamond.\nThe Company is classifying the resultant target as a high priority for drilling and has incorporated the testing of this target into its plans for the financial year ending May 2026.\nIn February 2025 the Company was granted a new reservation, namely \u201cKuumu-1\u201d in the Lentiira area of northern Kuhmo, which is approximately 30 kms to the north of the noted green diamond discovery.\nThe Lentiira area is considered highly prospective by the Company. Several orangeite dikes with highly prospective indicator mineral compositions were discovered in the area by European Diamonds PLC in the early 2000s, and diamonds were discovered by till sampling in a number of locations.\nConsidering the fact that the ultimate sources of the main indicator fans still remain unlocated, the exploration possibilities for the Company in the Lentiira area are interesting.\nExtensions for the exploration permits covering the Seitaper\u00e4 diamondiferous kimberlite (lamproite) in Kuhmo, and the kimberlite (olivine lamproite) discovery at Riihivaara are held until a minimum of Q1 2027.\nWe are pleased to note that the various licences in the Kuhmo area interlink and cover an area that has the potential to become a significant diamond province on the Finnish side of the Karelian Craton using a potential development at Lahtojoki as a production hub.\nThe Company held a public meeting in Kuhmo in January 2025 in relation to its diamond exploration activities in Finland which was well received.\nNickel, Copper and Platinum Group Metals in Northern Ireland\nYour Company holds a significant licence package covering over 1,000 km\n2\nin Northern Ireland where it has established first move advantage and continues to advance its exciting exploration programme exploring for Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Elements over the year under review.\nAn assessment of the Company\u2019s licences by Dr Larry Hulbert was commissioned in early 2024 and on completion of his work during the year under review, his report confirmed the significant potential for Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Elements and recommended a follow up work programme.\nThis assessment followed the discovery in October 2023 by the Company of indicator minerals for nickel, copper and platinum group metals during the course of a stream sediment sampling programme.\nIn June 2025 the Company announced that it had identified the site of the historic Cappagh Copper Mine which will provide a significant new copper target for investigation within its new KDR 4 licence area.\nThis further enhances the Company\u2019s strategic position in Northern Ireland.\nFurther investigation and detailed exploration work programmes are now being planned to review and assess the potential of this target.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Issues\nGreat emphasis is placed by the Company on these issues, and the Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and integrity in all its activities and operations, including rigorous health and safety compliance, environmental consciousness and the promotion of a culture of good ethical values and behaviour.\nFinancial Review\nThe Company recorded a loss for the financial year ended 31 May 2025 of \u20ac279,357 (31 May 2024: Loss of \u20ac237,160). At 31 May 2025 the Company had total assets of \u20ac12,246,037 (31 May 2024:\n\u20ac11,811342) and net assets at the same date of \u20ac10,141,861 (31 May 2024: \u20ac9,741,609).\nDuring the year under review total funds raised amounted to \u00a3651,822 at share prices ranging from 0.75 pence to 1.5 pence per share. Subsequent to the year end, in June 2025 a further \u00a3185,000 of funds were raised at a price of 0.75 pence per share.\nDirectors and Staff\nI would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank my fellow directors, staff and consultants for their work and contribution to the Company and its operations over the past year.\nThis is greatly appreciated and has contributed significantly to its progress.\nBrendan McMorrow\nChairman\n25 November 2025\nExtract from Independent Auditor\u2019s Report\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nWe draw attention to note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that during the financial year ended 31 May 2025, the Company incurred a loss of \u20ac279,357 and had net current liabilities of \u20ac1,913,340 as at that date.\nAs stated in note 1, these events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nOur evaluation of the directors\u2019 assessment of the Company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\nobtaining an understanding of the Company\u2019s relevant controls over the preparation of cash flow forecasts and approval of the projections and assumptions used in cash flow forecasts to support the going concern assumption;\nassessing the design and determining the implementation of these relevant controls;\nevaluating directors\u2019 plans and their feasibility by agreeing the inputs used in the cash flow forecast to expenditure commitments and other supporting documentation;\nchallenging the reasonableness of the assumptions applied by the directors in their going concern assessment;\nobtaining confirmations received by the Company from the directors and former directors evidencing that they will not seek repayment of amounts owed to them by the Company within 12 months of the date of approval of the financial statements, unless the Company has sufficient funds to repay;\nassessing the mechanical accuracy of the cash flow forecast model; and\nassessing the accuracy and completeness of the relevant disclosures made in the financial statements.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nStatement of profit or loss\nFor the year ended 31 May 2025\nNote\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nContinuing operations\nOperating expenses\n2\n(364,615)\n(418,312)\nOperating loss\n(364,615)\n(418,312)\nGain in fair value of warrants\n10\n91,738\n187,628\nInterest expense\n11\n(6,480)\n(6,476)\nTotal finance gain\n85,258\n181,152\nLoss before taxation\n3\n(279,357)\n(237,160)\nIncome tax expense\n5\n-\n-\nLoss for the financial year\n(279,357)\n(237,160)\nLoss per share\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n6\n(0.0020)\n(0.0023)\nThe total loss for the financial year is entirely attributable to equity holders of the Company.\nStatement of comprehensive income\nFor the year ended 31 May 2025\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nLoss for the financial year\n(279,357)\n(237,160)\nIncome recognised in other comprehensive income\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income for the financial year\n(279,357)\n(237,160)\nThe total comprehensive income for the financial year is entirely attributable to equity holders of the Company.\nStatement of financial position\nas at 31 May 2025\n31 May\n31 May\nNote\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n7\n12,085,967\n11,690,194\nTangible Assets\n2,114\n-\nTotal non-current assets\n12,088,081\n11,690,194\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n8\n40,862\n39,597\nOther receivables\n9\n117,094\n81,551\nTotal current assets\n157,956\n121,148\nTotal assets\n12,246,037\n11,811,342\nEquity\nCapital and reserves\nShare capital presented as equity\n12\n3,220,201\n3,203,532\nShare premium\n12\n11,399,829\n10,736,889\nShare-based payments reserve\n450,658\n450,658\nRetained deficit\n(4,928,827)\n(4,649,470)\nTotal equity\n10,141,861\n9,741,609\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nWarrant liabilities\n10,15\n32,880\n-\nTotal non-current liabilities\n32,880\n-\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n11\n1,928,790\n1,903,601\nConvertible loan\n11\n132,202\n125,722\nDerivative liability\n11\n10,304\n10,304\nWarrant liabilities\n11\n-\n30,106\nTotal current liabilities\n2,071,296\n2,069,733\nTotal liabilities\n2,104,176\n2,069,733\nTotal equity and liabilities\n12,246,037\n11,811,342\nStatement of changes in equity\nfor the financial year ended 31 May 2025\nShare\ncapital\nShare premium\nShare-based payment reserve\nRetained\ndeficit\nTotal\nequity\nNote\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nBalance at 1 June 2024\n3,203,532\n10,736,889\n450,698\n(4,649,470)\n9,741,609\nShare issue\n12\n16,669\n789,422\n-\n-\n806,091\nShare issue costs\n15\n-\n(126,482)\n-\n-\n(126,482)\nLoss for the financial year\n-\n-\n-\n(279,357)\n(279,357)\nBalance at 31 May 2025\n3,220,201\n11,399,829\n450,698\n(4,928,827)\n10,141,861\nBalance at 1 June 2023\n3,200,882\n10,546,844\n450,658\n(4,412,310)\n9,786,074\nShare issue\n12\n2,650\n298,555\n-\n-\n310,205\nShare issue costs\n-\n(108,510)\n-\n-\n(108,510)\nLoss for the financial year\n-\n-\n-\n(237,160)\n(237,160)\nBalance at 31 May 2024\n3,203,532\n10,736,889\n450,658\n(4,649,470)\n9,741,609\nShare capital\nThe share capital comprises of the nominal value share capital issued for cash and non-cash consideration. The share capital also comprises deferred share capital. The deferred share capital arose through the restructuring of share capital which was approved at the Annual General Meeting held on 9 December 2016. A detailed breakdown of the share capital figure is included in Note 12.\nShare premium\nThe share premium reserve comprises of the excess consideration received in respect of share capital over the nominal value of shares issued net of any direct share issue costs which are deducted from share premium in line with the Company\u2019s accounting policies.\nThe fair value of warrants issued as part of a fundraise are included in direct share issue costs (see note 15).\nRetained deficit\nThis reserve represents the accumulated losses absorbed by the Company to the statement of financial position date.\nStatement of cash flows\nfor the financial year ended 31 May 2025\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash flows from operating activities\nNote\nLoss for the financial year\n(279,357)\n(237,160)\nAdjustments for:\nMovement in fair value of warrants\n10\n(91,738)\n(187,628)\nInterest expense\n6,480\n6,476\n(364,615)\n(418,312)\nIncrease in trade and other payables\n11\n25,189\n467,514\nIncrease in other receivables\n9\n(35,543)\n(2,548)\nNet cash (used in) / from operating activities\n(374,969)\n46,654\nCash flows from investing activities\nExpenditure on intangible assets\n7\n(395,773)\n(424,300)\nPurchase of tangible assets\n(2,114)\n-\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(397,887)\n(424,300)\nCash flows from financing activities\nProceeds on issue of share capital\n12\n774,121\n301,205\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n774,121\n301,205\nIncrease / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n1,265\n(76,441)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of financial year\n39,597\n116,038\nCash and cash equivalents at end of financial year\n40,862\n39,597\nNotes\nto the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 May 2025\n1\nMaterial accounting policies\nReporting entity\nKarelian Diamond Resources P.L.C. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a company domiciled in Ireland. The Company is a public limited company incorporated in Ireland under registration number 382499. The registered office is located at Shannon Airport House, Shannon Free Zone, Shannon, Co. Clare, V14E370, Ireland.\nThe principal activity of the Company during the financial year is mineral exploration and development.\nBasis of preparation\nThe financial statements are presented in Euro (\u201c\u20ac\u201d). The Euro is the functional currency of the Company.\nThe financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value at each reporting date.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the Board of Directors and management to use judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Details of significant judgements are disclosed in the accounting policies.\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 25 November 2025.\nGoing concern\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors consider it appropriate to use the going concern assumption, which assumes the company will have sufficient resources to enable it to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\nThe Company recorded a loss of \u20ac279,357 (31 May 2024: loss of \u20ac237,160) for the financial year ended 31 May 2024. The Company had net assets of \u20ac10,141,861 (31 May 2024: \u20ac9,741,609) at that date. The Company had net current liabilities of \u20ac1,913,340 (31 May 2024: \u20ac1,948,585) at that date. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac40,862 (31 May 2024: \u20ac39,597) at 31 May 2025.\nAs set out in the Chairman\u2019s statement, the Company expects to incur capital expenditure in 2025 and 2026, consistent with its strategy as an exploration company.\nThe Directors have considered carefully the financial position of the Company and in that context, have prepared and reviewed cash flow forecasts for the period to 30 November 2026.\nIn doing so, the Directors are mindful of the risks faced by the business including in particular general industry risks facing companies in the natural resource sector as described in the Directors Report.\nThe Board of Directors are experienced at managing the peaks and troughs of investor sentiment in the natural resources industry and will continue to manage the cashflows of the Company including planning/revising work programmes according to available funds.\nThe Company continues to rely on the support of its Directors and also its ability to raise appropriate finance through either asset level investment or fresh issues of share capital to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\nIn this context the Board of Directors note\nthat\nall directors, namely, Brendan McMorrow, Maureen T.A. Jones, Howard Bird and Dr. Sor\u010ba Conroy, and former Directors namely S\u00e9amus P. FitzPatrick, James P. Jones and the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy, have confirmed that they will not seek repayment of amounts owed to them by the Company of \u20ac1,614,885 (31 May 2024: \u20ac1,476,970) for a minimum period of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, unless the Company has sufficient funds to repay.\nThe Directors recognise that net current liabilities of \u20ac1,913,340 (31 May 2024: \u20ac1,948,585) is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe cashflows include plans to raise funds to carry out the activities of the company and the Board of Directors are confident that adequate funds can be raised through strategic partnerships or direct market fundraising to meet their objectives.\nTo mitigate the risk of the timing and scale of investment not being met, the Board and management continue to take actions to monitor and manage the cost base and project implementation plans as appropriate.\nIn reviewing the proposed work programme for exploration and evaluation assets, the results obtained from the exploration programme, the support noted above from the Board (and past Board members), the funds raised post year end and the prospects for raising additional funds as required, the Board of Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying value and classification of assets and liabilities that would arise if the Company was unable to continue as going concern.\nStatement of compliance\nThe Company\u2019s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\n(i)\nNew and amended standards adopted by the Company\nThe Company has adopted the following amendments to standards for the first time for its annual reporting year commencing 1 June 2024:\nAmendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease liability in a sale and leaseback \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2024; and\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as current or\nnon-current \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2024.\nThe adoption of the above amendments to standards had no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company either due to being not applicable or immaterial.\n(ii)\nNew standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Company\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published and endorsed by the EU that are not mandatory for 31 May 2025 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Company.\nDirectors does not consider that those of the below that will be effective for the year ended 31 May 2026 will have a material effect on the financial statements and they are considering whether or not those that become effective in the following financial year will have any impact on the financial statements.\nAmendments to IAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2025;\nAmendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 17 regarding supplier finance arrangements \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2025;\nAmendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 regarding classification and measurement of financial instruments \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2026;\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards \u2013 Volume 11 \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2026;\nThe following new standards and amendments to standards have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but have not yet been endorsed by the EU, accordingly, none of these standards have been applied in the current year. The Board of Directors is currently assessing whether these standards if endorsed by the EU will have any impact on the financial statements of the Company.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2027;\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2027;\nAmendments to SASB standards regarding enhancement of their international applicability;\n(a)\nIntangible assets\nThe Company accounts for mineral expenditure in accordance with IFRS 6:\nExploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\n.\n(i)\nCapitalisation\nAll costs related to acquiring the legal rights to explore will be capitalised. All other costs incurred prior to acquiring the rights to explore are charged directly to the consolidated statement of profit or loss . Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure incurred on exploring, and testing exploration prospects are accumulated and capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation (\u201cE&E\u201d) assets.\nE&E capitalised costs include geological and geophysical costs, and other direct costs of exploration (drilling, trenching, sampling and technical feasibility and commercial viability activities). In addition, E&E capitalised costs include an allocation from operating expenses, including share-based payments. All such costs are necessary for exploration and evaluation activities.\nE&E capitalised costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.\nAt completion of appraisal activities if technical feasibility is demonstrated and commercial resources are discovered, then the carrying amount of the relevant E&E asset will be reclassified as a development and production asset, once the carrying value of the asset has been assessed for impairment. If following completion of appraisal activities in an area, it is not possible to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability, or if the right to explore expires, then the costs of such unsuccessful exploration and evaluation are written off to the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the event occurred.\n(ii)\nImpairment\nIf facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment review is performed. The following are considered to be key indicators of impairment in relation to E&E assets:\nThe period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired or will expire in the near future and is not expected to be renewed.\nSubstantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned.\nExploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area.\nSufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.\nThe Company accounts for mineral expenditure in accordance with IFRS 6:\nExploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\n.\n(i)\nCapitalisation\nAll costs related to acquiring the legal rights to explore will be capitalised. All other costs incurred prior to acquiring the rights to explore are charged directly to the consolidated statement of profit or loss . Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure incurred on exploring, and testing exploration prospects are accumulated and capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation (\u201cE&E\u201d) assets.\nE&E capitalised costs include geological and geophysical costs, and other direct costs of exploration (drilling, trenching, sampling and technical feasibility and commercial viability activities). In addition, E&E capitalised costs include an allocation from operating expenses, including share-based payments. All such costs are necessary for exploration and evaluation activities.\nE&E capitalised costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.\nAt completion of appraisal activities if technical feasibility is demonstrated and commercial resources are discovered, then the carrying amount of the relevant E&E asset will be reclassified as a development and production asset, once the carrying value of the asset has been assessed for impairment. If following completion of appraisal activities in an area, it is not possible to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability, or if the right to explore expires, then the costs of such unsuccessful exploration and evaluation are written off to the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the event occurred.\n(ii)\nImpairment\nIf facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment review is performed. The following are considered to be key indicators of impairment in relation to E&E assets:\nThe period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired or will expire in the near future and is not expected to be renewed.\nSubstantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned.\nExploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area.\nSufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.\nFor E&E assets, where the above indicators exist on an annual basis, an impairment test is carried out. The E&E assets are categorised into Cash Generating Units (\u201cCGU\u201d) on a country-by-country (where material) basis. The carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount and any resulting impairment loss is written off to the statement of profit or loss. The recoverable amount of the CGU is assessed as the higher of its fair value, less costs to sell, and its value in use.\n(b)\nIncome taxation expense\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive loss, in which case it is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n(c)\nShare-based payments\nThe Company classifies instruments issued as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments. When the warrants issued (see note 15 for details) have an exercise price in sterling, they are derivative in nature and are liability classified. They do not qualify for equity classification as any cash settlement on exercise of these warrants will be received in a foreign currency. Where warrants are issued in the functional currency of the Company and meet the other necessary conditions, they are recognised as equity instruments. The warrant liabilities are recognised at their fair value on initial recognition and subsequently are measured at fair value through statement of profit or loss. Any incremental direct costs associated with the issuance of warrants are taken as an immediate charge to finance costs through the statement of profit or loss. See note 11 for further details.\nFor equity-settled share-based payment transactions (i.e. the granting of share options and share warrants), the Company measures the services and the corresponding increase in equity at fair value at the measurement date (which is the grant date) using a recognised valuation methodology for the pricing of financial instruments (Binomial Lattice Model or Black Scholes Model).\n(d)\nTrade and other receivables and payables\nTrade and other receivables are measured at their transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade and other payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n(e)\nEarnings per share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.\n(f)\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n(g)\nPension costs\nThe Company provides for pensions for certain employees through a defined contribution pension scheme. The amount charged to the statement of profit or loss\nis the contribution payable in that financial year. Any difference between amounts charged and contributions paid to the pension scheme is included in receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.\n(h)\nForeign currencies\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies relating to costs and non-monetary assets are translated into \u20ac at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates on which the transactions occurred. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into \u20ac at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. The resulting profits or losses are dealt with in the statement of profit or loss .\n(i)\nDirectors\u2019 Loans\nDirectors\u2019 loans are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability.\n(j) Convertible loan\nAs the convertible loan is made up of both liability and derivative components, it is considered to be a compound financial instrument. At initial recognition, the carrying amount of a compound financial instrument is allocated to its liability and derivative components. The fair value of the liability, which is the difference between the transaction price and the fair value of the conversion feature, and derivative is recognised as a liability in the statement of financial position. The conversion feature is subsequently measured at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss. The liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Company accounts for the interest expense of the convertible loan note at the effective interest rate. The difference between the effective interest rate and interest rate attached to the convertible loan increases the carrying amount of the liability so that, on maturity, the carrying amount is equal to the capital cash repayment that the Company may be required to pay.\n(k) Ordinary shares\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from retained earnings, net of any tax effects.\nWhere warrants are issued for the sole purpose of assisting with an issue of equity or to meet broker transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of equity, the amount initially recognised, that is their fair value, is deducted from share premium.\nSubsequently, where the warrants qualify as equity they are recognised in other reserves and the amount recognised is not changed.\nIf the warrants qualify as a liability the fair value is trued up from one reporting period to the next through profit or loss.\n(l) Impairment - financial assets are measured at amortised cost\nFinancial assets measured at amortised cost are reviewed for impairment loss at each reporting date.\nThe Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d) as required under a simplified approach for receivables that do not contain a financing component. The Company\u2019s approach to ECL reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Significant financial difficulties of the counterparty, probability that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation and default in payments are all considered indicators for increases in credit risks. If the credit risk increases to the point that it is considered to be credit impaired, interest income will be calculated based on the gross carrying amount adjusted for the loss allowance. Any contractual payment which is more than 90 days past due is considered credit impaired.\n(m) Financial instruments\nRecognition and derecognition\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.\nClassification and initial measurement of financial assets\nExcept for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs (where applicable).\nImpairment of financial assets\nIFRS 9\u2019s impairment requirements use forward-looking information to recognise expected credit losses \u2013 the \u2018expected credit loss (ECL) model\u2019. Instruments within the scope of the requirements included loans and other debt-type financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, trade receivables, contract assets recognised and measured under IFRS 15 and loan commitments and some financial guarantee contracts (for the issuer) that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group considers a broader range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.\nSubsequent measurement of financial assets\nFinancial assets held within a different business model other than \u2018hold to collect\u2019 or \u2018hold to collect and sell\u2019 are categorised at FVTPL. Further, irrespective of the business model used, financial assets whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest are accounted for at FVTPL. All derivative financial instruments fall into this category, except for those designated and effective as hedging instruments, for which the hedge accounting requirements apply (see below). The category also contains an equity investment. The Group accounts for the investment at FVTPL and did not make the irrevocable election to account for the investment in XY Ltd and listed equity securities at FVOCI. The fair value was determined in line with the requirements of IFRS 13 \u2018Fair Value Measurement\u2019. Assets in this category are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss.\nThe fair values of financial assets in this category are determined by reference to active market transactions or using a valuation technique where no active market exists.\nClassification and measurement of financial liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, and, where applicable. Subsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, which are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss (other than derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedging instruments). All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument\u2019s fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included within finance costs or finance income.\n(n)\nSignificant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nSignificant judgements in applying the Company\u2019s accounting policies\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the Board of Directors to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Board of Directors evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. The Board of Directors bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and on other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of the reported amounts that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In the process of applying the Company\u2019s accounting policies above, the Board of Directors have identified the judgemental areas that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations), which are dealt with as follows:\nExploration and evaluation assets\nThe assessment of whether operating costs and salary costs are capitalised to exploration and evaluation costs or expensed involves judgement. The Board of Directors consider the nature of each cost incurred and whether it is deemed appropriate to capitalise it within exploration and evaluation assets. Given that the activity of management and the resultant administration and salary costs are primarily focused on the Company\u2019s diamond prospects, the Board of Directors consider it appropriate to capitalise a portion of such costs. These costs are reviewed on a line-by-line basis with the resultant calculation of the amount to be capitalised being specific to the activities of the Company in any given year.\nCash generating units (\u201cCGUs\u201d)\nAs outlined in the intangible assets accounting policy, the exploration and evaluation assets should be allocated to CGUs. The determination of what constitutes a CGU requires judgement. The Board of Directors consider its diamond licences in the Kuhmo region of Finland to be one CGU and its copper / nickel / platinum group element licences in Northern Ireland to be a separate CGU.\nThe carrying value of each CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the CGU is assessed as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The determination of value in use requires the following judgements:\nEstimation of future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.\nExpectation about possible variations in the amount or timing of the future cash flows.\nThe determination of an appropriate discount rate.\nGoing concern\nThe preparation of financial statements requires an assessment on the validity of the going concern assumption. The validity of the going concern assumption is dependent on the successful further development and ultimate production of the mineral resources and the availability of sufficient finance to bring the resources to economic maturity and profitability. The Board of Directors have reviewed the proposed programme for exploration and evaluation assets and, on the basis of the equity raised after the financial year, the results from the exploration programme and the prospects for raising additional funds as required, consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. Refer to page 30 for further details.\nDeferred tax\nNo deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses as it is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the related temporary differences can be utilised.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.\nExploration and evaluation assets\nThe carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets in the statement of financial position was \u20ac12,085,967 (31 May 2024: \u20ac11,690,194) at 31 May 2025 (Note 7).\nThe Board of Directors carried out an assessment, in accordance with IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources relating to likelihood of licence renewal, likelihood of further expenditure, possible discontinuation of activities over specific claims and available data which may suggest that the recoverable value of an exploration and evaluation asset is less than its carrying amount.\nThis assessment included an assessment of the likelihood of securing a future strategic investment or joint venture partner to assist with the development of the assets.\nThe granting, post year end, of a mining permit in Lahtojoki, provides the opportunity to progress the development of a central processing hub for its exploration assets in the Kuhmo region.\nHaving considered the prospects for both development of its diamond deposit and further exploration success in its licence area, the Board of Directors is satisfied as to the carrying value of these assets and is satisfied that these are recoverable, acknowledging however that their recoverability is dependent on future successful exploration efforts\nEmployee benefits \u2013 Share-based payment transactions\nThe Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with non-market performance conditions which fall within the scope of and are accounted for under the provisions of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment. Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the options under these schemes is recognised as an operating expense with a corresponding increase in the \u201cShare-based payment reserve\u201d, within equity, where the exercise price is granted in EUR or recognised as a liability where a different currency is quoted as the exercise price over the vesting period. The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Company has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options granted and the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Company is the Black Scholes Model. The fair value of these options is measured using an appropriate option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.\n2\nOperating expenses\n2025\n2024\nAnalysis of operating expenses\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nOperating expenses\n531,151\n570,309\nTransfer to intangible assets\n(166,536)\n(151,997)\n364,615\n418,312\nOperating expenses are analysed as follows:\nProfessional fees\n183,220\n214,285\nWages and salaries\n180,109\n185,705\nDirectors\u2019 Fees\n60,833\n74,662\nOther operating expenses\n65,489\n55,657\nAuditor\u2019s remuneration\n41,500\n40,000\n531,151\n570,309\nOther operating expenses consisted mainly of freight and courier, rent and printing, stationery and postage.\nOf the above costs, a total of \u20ac166,536 (31 May 2024: \u20ac151,997) is capitalised to intangible assets based on a review of the nature and quantum of the underlying costs. Refer to Note 1(a)(i) for further details. The costs capitalised to intangible assets mainly relate to the costs of geological and on-site personnel together with an appropriate portion of executive management salaries. \u20ac38,542 (31 May 2024: \u20ac57,500) is charged to the Statement of profit or loss in relation to Directors\u2019 salaries.\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nWages and salaries costs as disclosed above is analysed as follows:\nWages and salaries\n174,902\n171,618\nSocial insurance costs\n5,207\n14,087\n180,109\n185,705\nThe amount of wages, salaries and related costs incurred during the financial year was recorded as follows:\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCapitalised to intangible assets\n141,567\n83,058\nCharged to the profit or loss\n38,542\n107,309\n180,109\n190,367\nThe average number of persons employed during the year (including executive Directors) by activity was as follows:\n2025\n2024\nCorporate management and administration\n2\n2\nExploration and evaluation\n1\n1\n3\n3\nAn analysis of remuneration for each Director of the Company in the current financial year (prior to amounts transferred to intangible assets) is as follows:\nFees\n\u20ac\nSalary\n\u20ac\nTotal\n\u20ac\nProfessor Richard Conroy\n8,333\n27,083\n35,416\nMaureen T.A.

The convertible loan note is unsecured, has a term of 18 months and attracts interest at a rate of 5% per annum which is payable on the maturity or conversion of the convertible loan. The conversion price is at a price of 5 pence per ordinary share. The shareholder has the right to seek conversion of the principal amount outstanding on the convertible loan note and all interest accrued at any time during the term.\n\u20ac10,304 was recorded as a derivative liability attached to the total convertible loan note above and the net amount of \u20ac119,246 was initially recorded as the value of the convertible loan at 31 May 2023. The loan incurred interest of \u20ac6,480 in the current year (31 May 2024: \u20ac6,476). The convertible term has passed but the loan continues place on an informal basis on the same terms and is classified as a current liability for the year ended 31 May 2025.\nThe Company is in discussions to extend the term of the loan note.\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nOpening balance\n125,722\n119,246\nInterest payable\n6,480\n6,476\nClosing balance\n132,202\n125,722\n12\nCalled up share capital and share premium\nAuthorised:\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n7,301,310,041 consolidated ordinary shares of \u20ac0.00025 each\n1,825,328\n1,825,328\n317,785,034 deferred shares of \u20ac0.00999 each\n3,174,672\n3,174,672\n5,000,000\n5,000,000\nThe deferred shares do not entitle the holder to receive a dividend or other distribution.

These costs were recharged to the Company by Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. net of the shared costs of a consultants report in Northern Ireland.\nThese costs are analysed as follows:\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nSalaries\n52,811\n71,738\nRent and rates\n-\n13,310\nShared consultancy costs\n(20,628)\n-\nOther operating expenses\n30,325\n30,000\n62,508\n115,048\n(b)\nAt 31 May 2025, the Company owed \u20ac75,065 to Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. (31 May 2024: \u20ac144,551 owed to). Amounts owed to Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. were included within trade and other payables during the current year. During the financial year ended 31 May 2025, the Company paid \u20ac129,495\nto (31 May 2024: \u20ac23,007 was received from) Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C.\nas part of the cost sharing arrangement.\nDuring the financial year ended 31 May 2025, the Company was charged \u20ac62,508 (31 May 2024: \u20ac115,048) by Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. in respect of the allocation of certain costs as detailed in Note 14(a). In May 2023, Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. converted amounts owing to it equivalent to \u20ac143,943 (\u00a3125,000) into ordinary equity as detailed as part of the \u201cshare issue (c)\u201d detailed in Note 12 and a further \u20ac129,550 (\u00a3112,500) into a convertible loan instrument as detailed in Note 14.\n(c)\nKey management personnel are considered to be the Directors and other key management.\nThe compensation of all key management personnel during the year was \u20ac162,083 (2023: \u20ac148,250) including an amount of \u20ac25,000 (31 May 2024: \u20ac33,250) payable to the Company Secretary Cathal Jones in respect of services provided.\nFurther analysis of remuneration for each Director of the Company is set out in note 2.\n(d)\nDetails of share capital transactions with the Directors are disclosed in the Directors\u2019 Report.\n(e)\nApart from Directors\u2019 remuneration (detailed in Note 2 and Note 4), a convertible loan from a shareholder (which is detailed in Note 11) and share capital transactions (which are detailed within the Directors\u2019 Report), there have been no contracts or arrangements entered into during the financial year in which a Director of the Company had a material interest.\n15\nShare-based payments\nWarrants granted by the company generally have a vesting period ranging from one to two years. Details of the warrants outstanding during the financial year are as follows:\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2024\nNo. of Share Warrants\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\n\u20ac\nNo. of Share Warrants\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\n\u20ac\nAt 1 June\n27,900,000\n0.04871\n34,750,000\n0.05963\nGranted during the financial year\n54,876,664\n0.02217\n10,000,000\n0.05882\nLapsed during the financial year\n(27,900,000)\n0.04871\n(16,250,000)\n0.09412\nExercised during the financial year\n-\n-\n(600,000)\n0.02353\nAt 31 May\n54,876,664\n0.02217\n27,900,000\n0.04871\nThe company issued 11,799,997 sterling based warrants on 1 July 2024, with an estimated fair value at date of grant of \u20ac20,919. The company also issued 43,076,667 sterling based warrants on 20 February 2025, with an estimated fair value at date of grant of \u20ac73,593.\nBoth of these issues were in conjunction with the issue of ordinary shares as part of a financing.\nThe fair value of the warrants at the date of grant were deducted from share premium as a direct share issue cost (see Note 12).\nAs a result of the valuation performed at year end, the fair value of the sterling based warrants was \u20ac32,880 at 31 May 2025 (31 May 2024: \u20ac30,106) and accordingly \u20ac91,738 (31 May 2024: 187,628) was credited to the Statement of profit or loss as a movement in the fair value of warrants.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of warrants awards using the Black Scholes Model. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant and on revaluation at each year end using the Black Scholes Model is affected by Karelian Diamond Resources P.L.C. stock price, share price volatility as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the awards, the stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividends.\nThe following key input assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of the sterling based warrants at the balance sheet dates and date of issue during the year:\n31 May 2025\nDate of issue\n31 May 2024\nWarrants\nWarrants\nWarrants\nDividend yield\n0%\n0%\n0%\nShare price volatility\n85.106%\n66.395%\n65.956%\nRisk free interest rate\n3.88101%\n4.183%\n5.1582%\nExpected life (in years)\n0.0833 / 1.75\n1.0 / 2.0\n0.5\nDuring the prior year, the company issued 10,000,000 sterling based warrants in conjunction with the issue of ordinary shares as part of a financing and an amount of \u20ac108,510 was deducted from share premium as a direct issue cost (being the fair value of these warrants at date of grant).\n16\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial risk management objectives, policies and processes\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n(a)\nInflation;\n(b)\nInterest rate risk;\n(c)\nForeign currency risk;\n(d)\nLiquidity risk; and\n(e)\nCredit risk.\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company\u2019s risk management framework.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.\nRisk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company\u2019s activities.\nThe Company\u2019s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company\u2019s risk management policies and procedures and framework in relation to the risks faced.\n(a)\nInflation\nThe Company is exposed to the risk associated with inflation such as the impact of increased operating expenses including rent, light & heat and wages and salaries. The Chairman and Managing Director monitor costs on an ongoing basis.\n(b)\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company currently finances its operations through shareholders\u2019 funds and loan finance. The loan finance at 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024 relates to a convertible loan therefore any fluctuations in interest rates will not have an impact on the results of the Company and no sensitivity analysis has been performed. The Company did not enter into any hedging transactions with respect to interest rate risk.\n(c)\nForeign currency risk\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on purchases, loans and bank deposits that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. The Company is further exposed to foreign currency risk through the warrants denominated in sterling which is not the Company\u2019s functional currency.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to ensure that foreign currency risk is managed wherever possible by matching foreign currency income and expenditure. During the years ended 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024, the Company did not utilise foreign currency forward contracts or other derivatives to manage foreign currency risk.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign currency risk exposure in respect of the principal foreign currencies in which the Company operates was as follows at 31 May 2025:\nSterling exposure\nEuro exposure\nTotal\ndenominated in \u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash and cash equivalents\n(9)\n40,871\n40,862\nDerivative liability\n(10,304)\n-\n(10,304)\nConvertible Loan\n(132,202)\n-\n(132,202)\nTrade and other payables\n-\n(2,071,296)\n(2,071,296)\nOther prepayments\n-\n40,707\n40,707\nVAT/PAYE receivable\n-\n52,282\n52,282\nAmount due to Conroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\n-\n(75,065)\n(75,065)\nTotal exposure\n(142,515)\n(2,012,501)\n(2,155,016)\nThe Company\u2019s foreign currency risk exposure in respect of the principal foreign currencies in which the Company operates was as follows at 31 May 2024:\nSterling exposure\nEuro exposure\nTotal\ndenominated in \u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash and cash equivalents\n525\n39,017\n39,542\nDerivative liability\n(10,304)\n-\n(10,304)\nConvertible loan\n(125,722)\n-\n(125,722)\nTrade and other payables\n-\n(1,759,050)\n(1,759,050)\nOther prepayments\n-\n30,082\n30,082\nVAT/PAYE receivable\n-\n51,469\n51,469\nAmount due to Conroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\n-\n(144,551)\n(144,551)\nTotal exposure\n(135,501)\n(1,783,033)\n(1,918,534)\nThe following are the significant exchange rates that applied against \u20ac1 during the financial year:\nAverage Rate 2025\nAverage Rate 2024\nSpot Rate\n31 May\n2025\nSpot Rate\n31 May\n2024\nGBP\n0.840\n0.860\n0.841\n0.851\nSensitivity analysis\nA 10% strengthening of the Euro against Sterling, based on outstanding financial assets and liabilities at 31 May 2025 would have decreased the reported loss by \u20ac14,251 (31 May 2024: \u20ac13,550) as a consequence of the retranslation of foreign currency denominated financial assets at those dates. A weakening of 10% of the Euro against Sterling would have had an equal and opposite effect.\nIt is assumed that all other variables, especially interest rates, remain constant in the analysis.\n(d)\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and adverse conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company manages liquidity risk by regularly monitoring cash flow projections. The nature of the Company\u2019s exploration and appraisal activities can result in significant differences between expected and actual cash flows. Contractual maturities of financial liabilities as at 31 May 2025 were as follows:\nCarrying amount \u20ac\nContractual cash flows \u20ac\n6 months or less \u20ac\n6-12 months \u20ac\n1-2 years\n\u20ac\n2-5 years\n\u20ac\nTrade and other payables (including amounts owed to related party)\n1,928,790\n1,928,790\n307,130*\n-\n1,621,660**\n-\nConvertible loan\n142,506\n142,506\n142,506***\n-\n-\n-\n2,071,296\n2,071,296\n449,636\n-\n1,621,660\n-\nContractual maturities of financial liabilities as at 31 May 2024 were as follows:\nCarrying amount \u20ac\nContractual cash flows \u20ac\n6 months or less \u20ac\n6-12 months \u20ac\n1-2 years\n\u20ac\n2-5 years\n\u20ac\nTrade and other payables (including amounts owed to related party)\n1,903,601\n1,903,601\n426,631*\n-\n1,476,970**\n-\nConvertible loan\n136,026\n136,026\n136,026***\n-\n-\n-\n2,039,627\n2,039,627\n562,657\n-\n1,476,970**\n-\n\\* The amount of \u20ac307,130 (31 May 2024: \u20ac426,631) relates to other creditors and accruals (including amounts owed to Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C.).\n*\\* The Directors, Maureen T.A. Jones, Dr. Sor\u010ba Conroy, Howard Bird and Brendan McMorrow, and former Directors, S\u00e9amus P. FitzPatrick James P. Jones and the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy, have confirmed that they will not seek repayment of amounts owed to them by the Company of \u20ac1,621,660\n(31 May 2024: \u20ac1,476,970) within 12 months of the date of approval of the financial statements, unless the Company has sufficient funds to repay. There were no related party loans in existence at 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024 relating to monies owed to any of the Directors.\n***On 26 May 2023, the Company has entered into a convertible loan note agreement for a total amount of \u20ac129,550 (\u00a3112,500) with one of its shareholders. Please refer to Note 11 for further details.\nThe contractual cash amount owing at 31 May 2025 of \u20ac142,506 is reflected in the balance sheet of the Company split between a loan and an embedded derivative liability.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac40,862 at 31 May 2025 (31 May 2024: \u20ac39,597).\n(e)\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge its obligation.\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a cash deposit is not recovered. Company deposits are placed only with banks with appropriate credit ratings.\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash and cash equivalents\n40,862\n39,597\nOther receivables\n40,707\n30,082\n81,569\n69,679\nThe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are held at AIB Bank which has a credit rating of \u201cBBB\u201d (31 May 2024: \u2018\u2019BBB\u2019\u2019) as determined by Standard & Poor\u2019s Credit Rating.\nExpected credit loss\nThe Company measures credit risk and expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost using probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default. Management consider both historical analysis and forward-looking information in determining any expected credit loss. At 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024, all cash is accessible on demand and held with counterparties with a credit rating of BBB or higher. Having considered the credit rating of the counterparties and the outstanding balances, management have determined that for both financial years presented, the amount of ECL is immaterial.\n(f)\nFair values versus carrying amounts\nDue to the short-term nature of the majority of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost at 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024, the fair value equals the carrying amount in each case.\nThe carrying value of non-current financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n(g) Capital management\nThe principal activities of the Company are concentrating particularly on diamond exploration and evaluation.\nThe Company has historically funded its activities through share issues and placings and loans. The Company\u2019s capital structure is kept under review by the Board of Directors and it is committed to capital discipline and continues to maintain flexibility for future growth.\nThe capital structure of the Company consists of equity of the Company (refer to the statement of changes in equity and Note 12). The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.\n17\nPost balance sheet events\nThe Company announced on 10\nth\nJune 2025 that the mining concession had been registered by the Finnish National Land Survey into the land registry.\nThis decision facilitated the registration by the Finnish Safety and Chemical Agency (TUKES) of the mining rights for Lahtojoki, with registration number K7363. The mining concession certificate received from TUKES entitles the Company to utilise the minerals within the mining concession and the Company is now planning to proceed to the next stage of work on the mining concession area.\nThe Company announced on 17\nth\nJune 2025 that a promising new copper target had been identified around the Cappagh Copper Mine (an old copper mine where limited mining had been carried out historically).\nInitial desk-based studies and reconnaissance work have highlighted this a promising new target for the Company's exploration with further investigation and detailed exploration programmes now being planned to fully assess the potential of the Cappagh Copper Mine and the adjacent area.\nThe Company also raised funds of \u20ac217,239 (\u00a3185,000) on 20th June 2025 with a view to carrying out follow up exploration in Northern Ireland and to continue its ongoing work in Finland.\nThere were no further material events to note post year end.\n18\nApproval of the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 May 2025\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 25 November 2025 and authorised for issue on 25 November 2025. A copy of the audited financial statements will be available on the Company\u2019s website\nwww.kareliandiamondresources.com\nand will be available from the Company\u2019s registered office at Shannon Airport House, Shannon Free Zone, Shannon, Co. Clare, V14E370 Ireland.\n4272696_0.jpeg",
