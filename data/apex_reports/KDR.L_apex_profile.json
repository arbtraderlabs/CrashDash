ODM is a specialised laboratory for testing diamondiferous kimberlite indicator minerals.\nThe targets sampled were up-ice from the location of the green diamond discovery along a kimberlite indicator mineral train and were identified by geophysics and kimberlitic indicator analysis.\nSamples from the two locations returned anomalous concentrations of\nthirty-six purple to red peridotitic garnets\n(G9/10 Cr-pyropes garnets). Six of the peridotitic garnets were in the large range\n(0.5 to 1.0mm size\n). Partial alteration mantles, otherwise referred to as \"Kelyphitic rims\", were present on the peridotitic garnets. Kelyphitic rims are fragile and tend not be preserved on the peridotitic garnets if they have been transported any large distance.\nThe presence of G9/10 peridotitic garnets indicates that the material sampled has been derived from the diamond stability field where diamonds are formed.\nThe number and size of the peridotitic garnets, and the presence of Kelyphitic rims, suggests close proximity to a kimberlite source, from which the green diamond may have been derived.\nOrange mantle garnets\nwere also present in samples from these two locations. Orange mantle garnets can include eclogitic pyrope almandine garnets (G3) which, if present, are significant, as they tend to be associated with richer diamond grades. These orange mantle garnets will be tested in due course to establish whether or not eclogitic mantle materials are present.\nKimberlite indicator minerals were absent in locations further up-ice from the two anomalous locations. This, together with geophysical data, suggests that the kimberlite indicator mineral train, up-ice from the green diamond discovery, ends at an electromagnetic geophysical anomaly within which the kimberlite source of the green diamond may be located.\nGiven that indicator minerals were not present in samples further up ice, the positive sample result provides further evidence that the green diamond kimberlite source is closer to and within our targeted area.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nFurther results will be issued as the programme progresses.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"These results are most encouraging and are a major step forward in the Company's diamond exploration programme, in the highly prospective Kuhmo region. They also suggest that we may be getting very close to locating the source of the green diamond which the Company discovered.\n\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3895759_0.jpeg"

Results from a subsequent stream sediment sampling programme indicated high prospectivity for Nickel/Copper/Platinum Group Metals and a highly anomalous area was outlined.\nWe look forward to 2024 with optimism.\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources plc\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3897606_0.jpeg"
