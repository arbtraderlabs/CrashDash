The Directors have recently become aware that ZEL has experienced some short term liquidity issues arising from an earlier loan (US$1.5 million) to an acquisition target, such that it has not been able to meet its commitments to the Company under the Loan Facility Agreement. The Company has been informed that shareholders of ZEL have entered into a settlement agreement with the acquisition target and are now expecting to fully recover the loan money, with first repayment due to be paid before 31 December 2025. Such repayments will enable the Company to recommence drawdowns from ZEL under the Loan Facility Agreement.\nStatus regarding Potential Acquisitions\nSince completion on 29 October 2024 of the subscription by ZEL for\n222,407,081\nordinary shares in the Company, the Board's efforts have focussed on finding a suitable business to acquire by way of a reverse takeover (\"\nRTO\n\"). Over the past year, the Directors have met various possible candidates, undertaken site visits and conducted initial due diligence on several businesses - the last being as recently as October 2025. Companies from Uzbekistan, Poland and certain African countries, covering both the oil and gas and financial services sectors, have been considered. Unfortunately, none of these candidates have met the necessary criteria for a successful RTO\n.\nThe Board is presently in early discussions with several energy companies, which will require further time to conclude. The Company will make further announcement(s) if, and as soon as, transaction terms are agreed.\nFor further information, please contact:-\nBoston International Holdings Plc\nChristopher Pitman, Chairman\nchris.pitman@bihplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As of 30 June 2025, the Company had cash reserves of \u00a33,908.\nA review of the key events in the period:\n-\nOn 22 January 2025, the listing on the FCA's Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities of the Company's 148,219,943 ordinary shares, which is the issued share capital prior to completion of the subscription by Zarara Energy Limited (\"\nZEL\n\") (completed on 29 November 2024), were restored to listing on the FCA's Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities. This restored listing and trading does not extend to the 222,407,081 ordinary shares issued to ZEL on completion of the subscription.\n-\nOn 4 February 2025, William ('Brock') Henry Tuppeny III resigned as a Director of the Company for personal reasons.\n-\nOn 10 March 2025, the Company entered into\na bridge loan facility agreement with ZEL for the provision by ZEL to the Company of a bridge loan facility of up to \u00a3248,375.34 to be drawn down in tranches to be agreed between the parties and with an allocation budget to be agreed for each utilisation (the\n\"\nLoan Facility Agreement\n\"\n)\nt\no assist with the Company's working capital requirements.\nKey terms of the Loan Facility Agreement: -\n(a) interest is payable by the Company on any utilisation at 10% per annum from the relevant utilisation date.\n(b) any amount drawn down/utilised can be repaid by the Company at any time, but that all amounts drawn down/utilised (and all accrued interest) are repayable on the earlier of (i) 30 June 2026 or (ii) the transaction date on which the Company receives funds from a fundraising.\n(c) At 30 June 2025, \u00a361k has been drawn down under the Loan Facility Agreement.\nThe entering into the Loan Facility Agreement constituted a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3.\n-\nOn 9 April 2025, Abdulmunim Sultan Said Bin Brek\n(a replacement nominee of ZEL) was appointed\nas a Director of the Company.\nDuring the period the Board continued to discuss suitable acquisition targets and will update Shareholders when it is able to do so.\nChristopher Pitman\nChairman\nInterim Management Report\nCompany Objective\nThe Company was originally formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business in the foreign exchange (FX) sector. However, due to a lack of current opportunities in that sector, following the Company's General Meeting held on 6 September 2019, the Directors' efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business are no longer limited to a particular industry or geographic region.\nFollowing the completion of an acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the acquisition.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to a number of risk factors. The Directors have identified the following key risks in the second six months of this financial year. Other risk factors not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may also apply.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is dependent on its directors, in particular the Chairman, to manage the Company and its future strategy. If the Company were to lose the services of the Chairman, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to implement its future strategy.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is a shell company as defined by UKLR13 hose main aim is to acquire an operating business. There is an inherent risk in evaluation of any potential acquisition target and although the Company and the Directors will evaluate risks pertaining to a particular target, there can be no certainty that all of the significant risks can be identified or properly assessed.\nThe Company intends to finance any acquisition through the issue of Ordinary Shares, however it may be the case that any such acquisition may be only partially funded by equity and the Company may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund any acquisition. Whilst the Company continues its assessment of potential acquisition opportunities the Board will continue to prudently manage the Company's remaining cash reserves and minimise its operating expenses in order to put the Company in the best position possible to complete an acquisition.\nResponsibility Statement\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Interim Report in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"\nDTRs\n\") and with International Accounting Standard 34 on Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34).\nThe Directors (all non-executive) being Christopher Pitman, W Borden James, Said Mbarak Salim Al Digeil and Abdulmunim Sultan Said Bin Brek confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements\n, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' as contained in UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and that as required by DTR 4.2.7R and DTR 4.2.8R, the Interim Report gives a fair review of:\n-\nimportant events that have occurred during the first six months of the year;\n-\nthe impact of those events on the financial statements;\n-\na description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year;\n-\ndetails of any related party transactions that have materially affected the Company's financial position or performance in the six months ended 30 June 2025;
