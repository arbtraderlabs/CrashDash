The Directors have recently become aware that ZEL has experienced some short term liquidity issues arising from an earlier loan (US$1.5 million) to an acquisition target, such that it has not been able to meet its commitments to the Company under the Loan Facility Agreement. The Company has been informed that shareholders of ZEL have entered into a settlement agreement with the acquisition target and are now expecting to fully recover the loan money, with first repayment due to be paid before 31 December 2025. Such repayments will enable the Company to recommence drawdowns from ZEL under the Loan Facility Agreement.\nStatus regarding Potential Acquisitions\nSince completion on 29 October 2024 of the subscription by ZEL for\n222,407,081\nordinary shares in the Company, the Board's efforts have focussed on finding a suitable business to acquire by way of a reverse takeover (\"\nRTO\n\"). Over the past year, the Directors have met various possible candidates, undertaken site visits and conducted initial due diligence on several businesses - the last being as recently as October 2025. Companies from Uzbekistan, Poland and certain African countries, covering both the oil and gas and financial services sectors, have been considered. Unfortunately, none of these candidates have met the necessary criteria for a successful RTO\n.\nThe Board is presently in early discussions with several energy companies, which will require further time to conclude. The Company will make further announcement(s) if, and as soon as, transaction terms are agreed.\nFor further information, please contact:-\nBoston International Holdings Plc\nChristopher Pitman, Chairman\nchris.pitman@bihplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As of 30 June 2025, the Company had cash reserves of \u00a33,908.\nA review of the key events in the period:\n-\nOn 22 January 2025, the listing on the FCA's Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities of the Company's 148,219,943 ordinary shares, which is the issued share capital prior to completion of the subscription by Zarara Energy Limited (\"\nZEL\n\") (completed on 29 November 2024), were restored to listing on the FCA's Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities. This restored listing and trading does not extend to the 222,407,081 ordinary shares issued to ZEL on completion of the subscription.\n-\nOn 4 February 2025, William ('Brock') Henry Tuppeny III resigned as a Director of the Company for personal reasons.\n-\nOn 10 March 2025, the Company entered into\na bridge loan facility agreement with ZEL for the provision by ZEL to the Company of a bridge loan facility of up to \u00a3248,375.34 to be drawn down in tranches to be agreed between the parties and with an allocation budget to be agreed for each utilisation (the\n\"\nLoan Facility Agreement\n\"\n)\nt\no assist with the Company's working capital requirements.\nKey terms of the Loan Facility Agreement: -\n(a) interest is payable by the Company on any utilisation at 10% per annum from the relevant utilisation date.\n(b) any amount drawn down/utilised can be repaid by the Company at any time, but that all amounts drawn down/utilised (and all accrued interest) are repayable on the earlier of (i) 30 June 2026 or (ii) the transaction date on which the Company receives funds from a fundraising.\n(c) At 30 June 2025, \u00a361k has been drawn down under the Loan Facility Agreement.\nThe entering into the Loan Facility Agreement constituted a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3.\n-\nOn 9 April 2025, Abdulmunim Sultan Said Bin Brek\n(a replacement nominee of ZEL) was appointed\nas a Director of the Company.\nDuring the period the Board continued to discuss suitable acquisition targets and will update Shareholders when it is able to do so.\nChristopher Pitman\nChairman\nInterim Management Report\nCompany Objective\nThe Company was originally formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business in the foreign exchange (FX) sector. However, due to a lack of current opportunities in that sector, following the Company's General Meeting held on 6 September 2019, the Directors' efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business are no longer limited to a particular industry or geographic region.\nFollowing the completion of an acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the acquisition.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to a number of risk factors. The Directors have identified the following key risks in the second six months of this financial year. Other risk factors not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may also apply.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is dependent on its directors, in particular the Chairman, to manage the Company and its future strategy. If the Company were to lose the services of the Chairman, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to implement its future strategy.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is a shell company as defined by UKLR13 hose main aim is to acquire an operating business. There is an inherent risk in evaluation of any potential acquisition target and although the Company and the Directors will evaluate risks pertaining to a particular target, there can be no certainty that all of the significant risks can be identified or properly assessed.\nThe Company intends to finance any acquisition through the issue of Ordinary Shares, however it may be the case that any such acquisition may be only partially funded by equity and the Company may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund any acquisition. Whilst the Company continues its assessment of potential acquisition opportunities the Board will continue to prudently manage the Company's remaining cash reserves and minimise its operating expenses in order to put the Company in the best position possible to complete an acquisition.\nResponsibility Statement\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Interim Report in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"\nDTRs\n\") and with International Accounting Standard 34 on Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34).\nThe Directors (all non-executive) being Christopher Pitman, W Borden James, Said Mbarak Salim Al Digeil and Abdulmunim Sultan Said Bin Brek confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements\n, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' as contained in UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and that as required by DTR 4.2.7R and DTR 4.2.8R, the Interim Report gives a fair review of:\n-\nimportant events that have occurred during the first six months of the year;\n-\nthe impact of those events on the financial statements;\n-\na description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year;\n-\ndetails of any related party transactions that have materially affected the Company's financial position or performance in the six months ended 30 June 2025;

The Directors have recently become aware that ZEL has experienced some short term liquidity issues arising from an earlier loan (US$1.5 million) to an acquisition target, such that it has not been able to meet its commitments to the Company under the Loan Facility Agreement. The Company has been informed that shareholders of ZEL have entered into a settlement agreement with the acquisition target and are now expecting to fully recover the loan money, with first repayment due to be paid before 31 December 2025. Such repayments will enable the Company to recommence drawdowns from ZEL under the Loan Facility Agreement.\nStatus regarding Potential Acquisitions\nSince completion on 29 October 2024 of the subscription by ZEL for\n222,407,081\nordinary shares in the Company, the Board's efforts have focussed on finding a suitable business to acquire by way of a reverse takeover (\"\nRTO\n\"). Over the past year, the Directors have met various possible candidates, undertaken site visits and conducted initial due diligence on several businesses - the last being as recently as October 2025. Companies from Uzbekistan, Poland and certain African countries, covering both the oil and gas and financial services sectors, have been considered. Unfortunately, none of these candidates have met the necessary criteria for a successful RTO\n.\nThe Board is presently in early discussions with several energy companies, which will require further time to conclude. The Company will make further announcement(s) if, and as soon as, transaction terms are agreed.\nFor further information, please contact:-\nBoston International Holdings Plc\nChristopher Pitman, Chairman\nchris.pitman@bihplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As of 30 June 2025, the Company had cash reserves of \u00a33,908.\nA review of the key events in the period:\n-\nOn 22 January 2025, the listing on the FCA's Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities of the Company's 148,219,943 ordinary shares, which is the issued share capital prior to completion of the subscription by Zarara Energy Limited (\"\nZEL\n\") (completed on 29 November 2024), were restored to listing on the FCA's Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities. This restored listing and trading does not extend to the 222,407,081 ordinary shares issued to ZEL on completion of the subscription.\n-\nOn 4 February 2025, William ('Brock') Henry Tuppeny III resigned as a Director of the Company for personal reasons.\n-\nOn 10 March 2025, the Company entered into\na bridge loan facility agreement with ZEL for the provision by ZEL to the Company of a bridge loan facility of up to \u00a3248,375.34 to be drawn down in tranches to be agreed between the parties and with an allocation budget to be agreed for each utilisation (the\n\"\nLoan Facility Agreement\n\"\n)\nt\no assist with the Company's working capital requirements.\nKey terms of the Loan Facility Agreement: -\n(a) interest is payable by the Company on any utilisation at 10% per annum from the relevant utilisation date.\n(b) any amount drawn down/utilised can be repaid by the Company at any time, but that all amounts drawn down/utilised (and all accrued interest) are repayable on the earlier of (i) 30 June 2026 or (ii) the transaction date on which the Company receives funds from a fundraising.\n(c) At 30 June 2025, \u00a361k has been drawn down under the Loan Facility Agreement.\nThe entering into the Loan Facility Agreement constituted a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3.\n-\nOn 9 April 2025, Abdulmunim Sultan Said Bin Brek\n(a replacement nominee of ZEL) was appointed\nas a Director of the Company.\nDuring the period the Board continued to discuss suitable acquisition targets and will update Shareholders when it is able to do so.\nChristopher Pitman\nChairman\nInterim Management Report\nCompany Objective\nThe Company was originally formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business in the foreign exchange (FX) sector. However, due to a lack of current opportunities in that sector, following the Company's General Meeting held on 6 September 2019, the Directors' efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business are no longer limited to a particular industry or geographic region.\nFollowing the completion of an acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the acquisition.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to a number of risk factors. The Directors have identified the following key risks in the second six months of this financial year. Other risk factors not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may also apply.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is dependent on its directors, in particular the Chairman, to manage the Company and its future strategy. If the Company were to lose the services of the Chairman, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to implement its future strategy.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is a shell company as defined by UKLR13 hose main aim is to acquire an operating business. There is an inherent risk in evaluation of any potential acquisition target and although the Company and the Directors will evaluate risks pertaining to a particular target, there can be no certainty that all of the significant risks can be identified or properly assessed.\nThe Company intends to finance any acquisition through the issue of Ordinary Shares, however it may be the case that any such acquisition may be only partially funded by equity and the Company may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund any acquisition.

As of 30 June 2024, the Company had cash reserves of \u00a3437.\nPost period end, as announced on 2 December 2024, the Company confirms that it has received the subscription monies for the new ordinary shares issued to Zarara Energy Limited.\nA review of the key events in the period is shown below.\nChristopher Pitman\nChairman\nInterim Management Report\nCompany Objective\nThe Company was originally formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business in the foreign exchange (FX) sector, however due to a lack of current opportunities in that sector, following the general meeting held on 6 September 2019, the Directors' efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business are no longer limited to a particular industry or geographic region.\nFollowing the completion of an acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the acquisition.\nKey Events\nOn 3 January 2024 the Company announced that the Directors of BIH have each individually subscribed for a total of \u00a323,217.54 new zero coupon convertible unsecured loan notes (the \"New Loan Notes\"). The New Loan Notes are repayable on 31 March 2024, do not carry interest and are convertible into ordinary shares at a price of 0.75p. The Directors have subscribed for the following amounts: Christopher Pitman: \u00a35,804.38 Martin Lampshire: \u00a35,804.38 Richard Hartheimer: \u00a35,804.39 William Borden James: \u00a35,804.39. The subscription by Directors for the New Loan Notes is a material related party transaction for the purposes of DTR 7.3.8R. On 30 September 2024 the Final Repayment date for the Notes was extended to 31 December 2025.\nOn 24 May 2024 the Company announced the termination of the potential acquisition of Hyperion Resources Limited. The shares in the Company remained suspended.\nOn 18 July 2024 the Company announced that it has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Linkvalue Investment Limited (\"LVIL\"), a privately owned company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, for the subscription by LVIL (or its nominee) for such number of new ordinary shares in the Company as would represent a 51% of the Company's enlarged and fully diluted share capital of the Company for an aggregate of \u00a3306,000 in cash, payable on completion of the subscription. LVIL is under the same family ownership as Al-Braik Investments LLC, a diversified holding company based in the United Arab Emirates and specialising in real estate, oil & gas, hospitality, franchising, investment, construction and construction support services. The subscription, if completed, would result in the Company's existing shareholders having a minority shareholding in the Company. LVIL did not own any existing ordinary shares or other securities in the Company. LVIL (or its nominee) would appoint two nominee Directors to the board of directors of the Company (the \"Board\") on completion of the Subscription and two of the existing Directors would resign from the Board (without payment of any compensation). Pursuant to the LOI, LVIL has paid a cash deposit of \u00a365,000 to the Company, to be used by the Company to pay certain agreed creditors and professional fees. If the approval of shareholders of the Company and other regulatory approvals required to complete the Subscription are not received and a substantively similar transaction is not entered into and completed between the parties, the deposit was to be converted into such number of new ordinary shares in the Company as would represent 10.833% of the Company's enlarged and fully diluted share capital.\nOn 2 October 2024 the Company announced that the Final Repayment Date of all outstanding convertible loan notes issued by the Company had been extended (with the consent of the holders in all cases) to 31 December 2025 and some minor changes to such convertible loan notes have been ",

The Yansse Gold Project comprises an exploration licence (\n\"Yansse\"\n) with an area of 47,404 square kilometres, awarded in May 2019 for a total tenure of up to nine years, and on expiry, an application can be made to the Ministry of Mines for transfer to a mining licence subject to satisfactory exploration and feasibility studies. Camel Gold also has outstanding permit applications in the Burkina Faso Mining Cadastre for two further gold & other precious metals exploration licences located immediately adjacent to Yansse and which indicate a regional continuation of a major geological shear zone favourable for the occurrence of gold deposits and marked by intense local artisanal mining activities.\nThe Company considers Yansse to be a potentially significant high impact exploration opportunity which has been the focus of investment by Hyperion through a targeted work programme which has demonstrated the overall prospectivity for a potential gold deposit with the presence of potential multiple exploration targets.\u00c2 The Yansse licence is both on geological trend (Birimian greenstone belt) and geologically analogous to the Kiaka, Bombore and Sanbrado commercial deposits which are all located within 30 kilometres of the licence boundary.\nChristopher Pitman (Chairman of BIH), an experienced resource geologist, will shortly be appointed as director of Hyperion with full authority on behalf of the Hyperion board to progress the transaction in order to meet the FCA's deadline date of 1 December 2023 for a 'complete submission' to the FCA and re-admission of the Company's shares to listing\non the FCA's Official List (standard segment)\nwith a market capitalisation of less than \u00c2\u00a330 million.\nPotential Acquisition/RTO\nThe Potential Acquisition, if completed, would result in the Company's existing shareholders having a minority interest in the enlarged group (the \"\nEnlarged\nGroup\n\") and would constitute a reverse takeover (\"\nRTO\n\") under the FCA's Listing Rules\nsince, inter alia, in substance it would result in a fundamental change in the business of the Company.\nThe Potential Acquisition remains subject,\ninter alia\n, to completion of customary due diligence and regulatory approvals and there is therefore no certainty that the Potential Acquisition will proceed.\u00c2 In addition, the Potential Acquisition would be conditional on:-\n-\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 approval by shareholders of the Company at a general meeting (including approval of a waiver resolution for the purposes of Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers in relation to the resultant Hyperion shareholders position), notice of which would be sent to the Company's shareholders in due course;\n-\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 completion of an equity fundraising in order to provide additional capital for the Enlarged Group for the financing the exploration and development of its Yansse Gold Project; and\n-\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 publication of a prospectus and agreeing the eligibility in respect of the Enlarged Group (both subject to the FCA approval) and admission of the Enlarged Group to listing on the FCA's Official List (standard segment) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities (the \"\nReadmission\n\").\nContinuation of Suspension of Listing\nThe listing of the Company's existing issued ordinary shares on the FCA's Official List (standard segment) was suspended on 27 April 2023 and, a\ns set out in\nthe Company's announcement on 29 September 2023, it is to remain suspended until either termination of the Proposed Transaction or Readmission.\nChristopher Pit",

As at 30 June 2023 the Company had cash reserves \u00a345,725.\nDuring the period under review the Directors have continued to actively review potential acquisition opportunities for the Company\nand on 27 April 2023 announced that the Company is in preliminary discussions with the shareholders of Topic S.A. (\"\nTopic\n\") for the acquisition of all (or, at least, not less than a majority) of the issued share capital of Topic in exchange for the issue of new ordinary shares in the Company (the \"\nPotential Acquisition\n\").\nThe evaluation and due diligence on the Potential Acquisition is ongoing and the Company will update the Shareholders further in due course.\nIt should be noted though that following the changes to the Financial Conduct Authority's (the \"\nFCA\"\n) Listing Rules announced on 2 December 2021, which confirmed an increase to the minimum market capitalisation threshold for both the premium and standard listing segments for shares in ordinary commercial companies from \u00a3700,000 to \u00a330 million, the Company\n,\nas a standard listed SPAC that listed before 3 December 2021, is subject to transitional provisions in relation to market capitalisation which allows it to rely on the \u00a3700,000 market capitalisation. This transitional provision comes to an end later this year and therefore to be able to utilise it, the Company will need to make a complete submission to the FCA in relation to a reverse takeover transaction by 4.00pm on 1 December 2023. Should the Company not be able to make a complete submission within this period, it will no longer be able to rely on the transitional provision and will need comply with \u00a330 million market capitalisation requirement.\nChristopher Pitman\nChairman\nInterim Management Report\nCompany Objective\nThe Company was originally formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business in the foreign exchange (FX) sector, however due to a lack of current opportunities in that sector, following the general meeting held on 6 September 2019, the Directors' efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business are no longer limited to a particular industry or geographic region.\nFollowing completion of an acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the acquisition.\nKey Events\nOn 27 January 2023, the Company announced that the Directors have subscribed for an aggregate of 16,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each at a subscription price of 0.5 pence per share in cash, raising \u00a380,000 for the Company.\nOn 27 April 2023, the Company announced that it is in preliminary discussions with the shareholders of Topic for the acquisition of all (or, at least, not less than a majority) of the issued share capital of Topic in exchange for the issue of new ordinary shares in the Company. Topic is a privately-owned, oil and gas exploration and production company, incorporated in Tunisia, with interests in three oil and gas blocks in offshore and onshore Tunisia. If completed it would result in the Company's existing shareholders having a minority interest in the enlarged group and would constitute a reverse takeover under the FCA's Listing Rules. The Company's issued ordinary shares have therefore been suspended from the FCA's Official List (standard segment). The Potential Acquisition remains subject to satisfactory completion of customary due diligence, regulatory and shareholder approvals.\nOn 26 June 2023, the Company announced that Boston Merchant (HK) Limited, a company controlled by Mr. James, a Director of the Company, had subscribed for 20,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence at a subscription price of 0.5 pence per share in cash. The funds, amounting to \u00a3100,000, will be used for on-going working capital purposes.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to a number of risk factors. The Directors have identified the following key risks in the second six months of this financial year. Other risk factors not presently known or currently deemed immateria",

(\"\nTopic\n\") for the acquisition by the Company of all (or, at least, not less than a majority) of the issued share capital of Topic\nin exchange for the issue of new ordinary shares in the Company (the \"\nPotential Acquisition\n\").\nTopic is a privately-owned, oil and gas exploration and production company, incorporated in Tunisia, with interests in three oil and gas blocks in offshore and onshore Tunisia:-\n-\na 100% operated working interest in the offshore Halk el Menzel concession block which includes the producing Halk el Menzel oil field and which covers an offshore area of 570 km2 in the Gulf of Hammamet in northern Tunisia. The national oil company, Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petroliere (ETAP), retains an option to acquire 50% of the concession in case of any new discovery within the concession area;\n-\na 15% interest (30% working interest) in the onshore Jelma exploration block, covering an area of 7,216 km2 located in central west Tunisia - with the block currently operated by Enterprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petroliere (ETAP) holding an 85% interest; and\n-\na 43.75% interest in the offshore Zelfa concession block, covering an area\nof 100 km2\nand also located in in the Gulf of Hammamet in northern Tunisia, with Topic being the operator.\nPotential Acquisition/RTO\nThe Potential Acquisition, if completed would result in the Company's existing shareholders having a minority interest in the enlarged group (the \"\nEnlarged\nGroup\n\") and would constitute a reverse takeover (\"\nRTO\n\") under the FCA's Listing Rules. The Company has therefore requested an immediate suspension of the listing of its existing issued ordinary shares on the FCA's Official List (standard segment).\nThe Potential Acquisition remains subject,\ninter alia\n, to completion of customary due diligence and regulatory approvals and there is therefore no certainty that the Potential Acquisition will proceed.\nIn addition, the Potential Acquisition would be conditional on:-\n- approval by shareholders of the Company at a general meeting (including approval of a Rule 9 waiver resolution in relation to the resultant shareholders position) at a general meeting by the shareholders of the Company, notice of which would be sent to shareholders in due course;\n- completion of an equity fundraising in order to provide additional capital for the Enlarged Group for the financing of its exploration projects and to improve of its debt ratio; and\n- publication of a prospectus in respect of the Enlarged Group (following its approval by the FCA) and admission of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company to listing of the FCA's Official List (standard segment) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities.\nBIH Chairman, Christopher Pitman, commented:-\n\"This potential transaction offers shareholders an exciting opportunity to participate in the ongoing exploration, appraisal and development of oil reserves both offshore and onshore Tunisia as well as in the greater North African region.\"\nFor more information, please contact:-\nBoston International Holdings Plc\nChristopher Pitman, Chairman\n+44 (0) 7768 104329\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company is proposing to simplify its balance sheet by buying back and cancelling the Deferred Shares in accordance with the rights attaching to such Deferred Shares for an aggregate consideration of 1 pence.\nThe Company currently has no distributable reserves to finance the buy-back of the Deferred Shares and, therefore, this will be financed by a fresh issue of new\nordinary shares in the Company\n. The Directors have therefore allotted and issued 100 new\nordinary shares of 0.1 pence each in the Company\n(the \"\nNew Shares\n\") to Richard Hartheimer (a Director of the Company)\n, at a price of 1 pence per ordinary share (being a small premium to the current market price of an ordinary share in the Company)\n. Part of the proceeds of the issue of the New Shares will be used to fund the aggregate 1 pence purchase price of the Deferred Shares. The board of Directors of the Company (the \"\nBoard\n\") considers this to be the best way of funding the buy-back of the Deferred Shares given the Company currently has no distributable reserves.\nRichard Hartheimer does not currently have any interest in Ordinary Shares, so that his interest in Ordinary Shares following this allotment is 100 Ordinary Shares.\nApplication will be made to the FCA for the New Shares to be admitted to listing on the FCA's Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for the New Shares to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities (together\n\"\nAdmission\n\"\n). It is expected that Admission of the New Shares will take place on or around 8.00 a.m. on 21 November 2022 and that dealings in the New Shares will commence at the same time.\nFor more information, please contact:-\nBoston International Holdings Plc\nChristopher Pitman, Chairman\n+44 (0) 7768 104329\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (Financial Adviser)\nRoland Cornish\n+44 (0) 20 7628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey / Eran Zucker\n+44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThe following information relating to the transaction by Richard Hartheimer has been filed with the FCA in accordance with Article 19(1) of UK MAR.\nNotification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them.\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\nRichard Hartheimer\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\nDirector\nb)\nInitial notification /Amendment\nInitial notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auct",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",

This link https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/boston_international/news/rns/story/rn9zkpw has a recent doc (to do with fundraising) which has a section stating: \"Serious loss of capital It has recently come to the attention of the BIH Board that the value of the Company's net assets is less than half of its called-up share capital and that is deemed to be a 'serious loss of capital' within the meaning of section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\"). In such circumstances, the Directors of the Company are required, pursuant to section 656(1) of the Companies Act, to call a general meeting to consider whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. Accordingly, the business to be conducted at the General Meeting (referred to above for the purposes of approving the Share Capital Reorganisation) will also include consideration of what, if any, such steps should be taken. The BIH Board does not consider it necessary for specific resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting in relation to the 'serious loss of capital' position, but it does however invite shareholders of the Company to discuss the position generally at the General Meeting. Whilst the Placing, which will raise \u00a3187,033 (before expenses) for the Company, and the receipt of the \u00a3147,857 subscription monies for the New Convertible Loan Notes will not result in the Company's net assets equalling or exceeding half of its called-up share capital, it will go some way to addressing the position.\" Make of it what you will, but I think shenanigans are a foot somewhere.",
