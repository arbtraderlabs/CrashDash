The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The new Ordinary Shares will be issued at a price of \u00a30.01 per share (the \"Issue Price\"), which represents a discount of 23% to the closing mid-price of \u00a30.013 per share on 19 December 2025.\nFundraise\nThe net proceeds of the fundraise will provide the Company with the additional working capital required to meet the costs of the expanded drilling programme. Meterage drilled was increased by 70% due to the encouraging results of the initial holes as reported to investors on 15 December 2025, which also resulted in an increased number of samples dispatched to South Africa for geochemical assays.\nThis is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage. Assay results are expected in early 2026 and once received they will be rapidly used to prepare and publish the project's MRE.\nExercise of Warrants\nIt is noted that application for the Admission of the 5,000,000 warrants over shares at a price of \u00a30.01 per share to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, as announced on 15 December 2025 (the \"Warrant Shares\"), was previously reported to be on 19 December 2025. Admission in respect of the Warrant Shares will now be made on 6 January 2026.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Subscription Shares to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Subscription Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares and it is expected that admission will become effective and dealings commence at 8:00 a.m. on or around 7 January 2026.\nFollowing this issue of the Subscription Shares and the Warrant Shares, the Company's enlarged issued share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 321,864,306 Ordinary Shares. The Company has no shares held in Treasury. This figure of 321,864,306 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am pleased that we have secured funding for the additional drilling and assays, which puts us in a position to deliver a larger MRE than originally anticipated.

Most holes have encountered visible fluorspar mineralization.\nThe meterage drilled exceeds by 70% the originally planned 2,000m. The drilling program was expanded due to the encouraging results of the initial holes and to the discovery of new targets, announced on 28 October 2025. This expansion is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage.\nSamples dispatched to South African laboratories, data collection completed\n3,160 geochemical samples and 3 representative metallurgical samples of fluorspar-gallium ore have been dispatched to assay and metallurgical testing laboratories in South Africa. Assay results are expected in early 2026 and once received they will be rapidly used to prepare and publish the project's MRE.\nData collection on site was completed, including logging, density measurements, and Real Time Kinetic (\"RTK\") topography surveying of the different fluorspar areas. The RTK survey will allow the Company to prepare reliable, high-resolution digital terrain models which are necessary for MRE calculations.\nAs part of the requirements for the planned fluorspar and gallium JORC MRE, competent person Joshua Hattingh carried out the site visit from 18 to 21 November 2025. The site visit enabled Mr Hattingh to verify both historical and new drilling collars, and the implementation of drilling, logging, sampling and surveying standard operating procedures. Mr Hattingh also visited the sample assay laboratory in South Africa.\nUSTDA engagement for the Monte Muambe rare earths project continues to progress\nThe Company is pleased to report that engagements with the USTDA with respect to possible funding of the rare earths Prefeasibility Study have resumed after the end of the US Government shutdown and are progressing rapidly, with an expected decision in early 2026.\nBusiness development activities\nIn line with the diversification strategy announced in 2024, the Company continues to assess the possible low-cost acquisition of mineral assets having potential for low capex, rapid development, and cash flow generation, in order to create a long-term pipeline of projects. It is expected that at least one such project will be acquired in the first half of 2026.\nExercise of Warrants\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has received a Notice of Exercise from an existing warrant holder in respect of 5 million warrants over shares at a price of 1 pence per ordinary share.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication is being made for the new ordinary shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 19 December 2025. Following this issue of 5,000,000 shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing ordinary shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 296,864,306. The Company has no shares held in Treasury. This figure of 296,864,306 ordinary shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am pleased with the completion of a very busy 2025 drilling campaign, with positive results on the ground justifying a 70% increase of the drilled meterage, underpinning the potential for a larger MRE than originally anticipated.\nI look forward to the publication of the fluorspar-gallium MRE in early 2026, as soon as the assay results have been returned by the lab, as well as to progress on the USTDA front for the rare earths.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson Limited (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nZeus Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nSimon Johnson\nJames Hornigold\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa. The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe information in this RNS that relates to geology and exploration results is based on information compiled and/or reviewed by C\u00e9dric Simonet, who is a Member of European Geologist Federation (Eur.
