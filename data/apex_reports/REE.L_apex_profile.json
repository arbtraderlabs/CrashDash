This exercise of warrants brings in cash funds of \u00a3450,000 which will be used to fund the fluorspar and gallium resource estimate and scoping study.\nConversion of Interest into Equity\nIn addition, the Company has received notification from its remaining lender that they have elected to convert interest of \u00a320,000 into Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, the Company will also issue 2,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nInterest Shares\n\") at a price of 1 penny per Interest Share, in settlement of the interest converted.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nThe Warrant Shares have previously been disclosed in a published prospectus. The Interest Shares, issued pursuant to the lender's election to convert interest into equity, are being issued from authorities granted to directors to issue new Ordinary Shares at the annual general meeting of the Company's shareholders on 26 November 2025.\nApplication is being made for the New Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 13 February 2026. Following this issue of 32,000,000 new Ordinary Shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing Ordinary Shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 358,682,302.\u00a0The Company has no shares held in Treasury.\u00a0This figure of 358,682,302 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am pleased to see the increasing market recognition of the value within Altona's portfolio and strategy, and I am grateful for our existing shareholders'\u00a0support as we continue delivering on this strategy.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\n-ends-\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108 (cs@altonare.com)\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922 (la@altonare.com)\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nZeus Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nSimon Johnson\nJames Hornigold\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa. The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This support is subject to the execution of a formal grant agreement, which is in preparation.\nThis commitment from USTDA coincides with a broader announcement by the United States Government at the 2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial. The announcement outlined a tangible commitment to reshape the global critical minerals market through the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE), alongside the mobilisation of significant and unprecedented resources to secure resilient and sustainable mineral supply chains.\nIn the meantime, the Company expects to receive the assay results from its recent and extensive fluorspar and gallium drilling campaign in the near future. The Company anticipates that these results, and the resulting mineral resource estimate, will demonstrate that the fluorspar component of the Monte Muambe project represents a viable mining project of significant interest.\nCedric Simonet, CEO, commented: \"\nThis commitment of support from USTDA is a powerful external validation of the Monte Muambe project's strategic quality and economic potential. It highlights the strong, high-level interest from a leading U.S. government institution in developing a secure, alternative source of rare earths. This partnership is a clear endorsement of our progress in Mozambique, reinforces our shared objective to advance a project of growing strategic relevance, and highlights the role Monte Muambe can play in building more resilient global supply chains for both rare earths and fluorspar.\"\n-ends-\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108 (cs@altonare.com)\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922 (la@altonare.com)\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nZeus Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nSimon Johnson\nJames Hornigold\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa. The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The new Ordinary Shares will be issued at a price of \u00a30.01 per share (the \"Issue Price\"), which represents a discount of 23% to the closing mid-price of \u00a30.013 per share on 19 December 2025.\nFundraise\nThe net proceeds of the fundraise will provide the Company with the additional working capital required to meet the costs of the expanded drilling programme. Meterage drilled was increased by 70% due to the encouraging results of the initial holes as reported to investors on 15 December 2025, which also resulted in an increased number of samples dispatched to South Africa for geochemical assays.\nThis is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage.

The Company has no shares held in Treasury. This figure of 321,864,306 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am pleased that we have secured funding for the additional drilling and assays, which puts us in a position to deliver a larger MRE than originally anticipated.

Most holes have encountered visible fluorspar mineralization.\nThe meterage drilled exceeds by 70% the originally planned 2,000m. The drilling program was expanded due to the encouraging results of the initial holes and to the discovery of new targets, announced on 28 October 2025. This expansion is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage.\nSamples dispatched to South African laboratories, data collection completed\n3,160 geochemical samples and 3 representative metallurgical samples of fluorspar-gallium ore have been dispatched to assay and metallurgical testing laboratories in South Africa. Assay results are expected in early 2026 and once received they will be rapidly used to prepare and publish the project's MRE.\nData collection on site was completed, including logging, density measurements, and Real Time Kinetic (\"RTK\") topography surveying of the different fluorspar areas. The RTK survey will allow the Company to prepare reliable, high-resolution digital terrain models which are necessary for MRE calculations.\nAs part of the requirements for the planned fluorspar and gallium JORC MRE, competent person Joshua Hattingh carried out the site visit from 18 to 21 November 2025. The site visit enabled Mr Hattingh to verify both historical and new drilling collars, and the implementation of drilling, logging, sampling and surveying standard operating procedures. Mr Hattingh also visited the sample assay laboratory in South Africa.\nUSTDA engagement for the Monte Muambe rare earths project continues to progress\nThe Company is pleased to report that engagements with the USTDA with respect to possible funding of the rare earths Prefeasibility Study have resumed after the end of the US Government shutdown and are progressing rapidly, with an expected decision in early 2026.\nBusiness development activities\nIn line with the diversification strategy announced in 2024, the Company continues to assess the possible low-cost acquisition of mineral assets having potential for low capex, rapid development, and cash flow generation, in order to create a long-term pipeline of projects. It is expected that at least one such project will be acquired in the first half of 2026.\nExercise of Warrants\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has received a Notice of Exercise from an existing warrant holder in respect of 5 million warrants over shares at a price of 1 pence per ordinary share.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication is being made for the new ordinary shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 19 December 2025.

The samples were selected for fluorine analysis based on their high gallium content (>60 ppm Ga), in line with Altona's proven exploration strategy of using gallium as a tracer for high-grade fluorspar.\nResults show that 38% of these samples have fluorine concentrations in excess of 5,000 ppm (equivalent to >10% CaF2), underpinning a very high success rate.\nResults received so far have allowed Altona to define three new targets: Jambire, Jambire Mn and Kudu. Ground proofing has confirmed the presence of fluorspar float and outcrops at each target. This justifies further investigation through trenching and drilling. The 2025 drilling programme is currently being amended and expanded to include these targets following such encouraging results.\nFigure 1 - Fluorspar ore bodies and targets at Monte Muambe\nDrilling Update: Visible fluorspar in 45% of core samples extracted to date\nTo date, the Company has completed approximately 600 meters of diamond drilling. Core samples will be split in order to produce representative sub-samples, which will be sent to specific laboratories for geochemical assays and metallurgical testing. The Company will use the services of laboratories located in neighbouring South Africa, thus significantly reducing sample logistics timelines compared to previous drilling campaigns.\nAs in previous campaigns, samples are also being routinely assayed using the Company's pXRF analyser. While pXRF analysers cannot assay for fluorine, or indeed fluorspar, fluorspar can be visually identified in the samples, and its presence recorded during logging.\nApproximately 45% (by length) of drilled cores extracted so far show visible fluorspar. Final grades will be confirmed through laboratory assays.\nThe Company's pXRF analyser, however, has previously proven invaluable in providing first pass Ce, La, Nd and Y assays and in guiding day-to-day decisions on drilling and sampling. It is currently being used in the same manner for Ga assays. Unprepared cores are assayed at 20 cm intervals along the entire length of each hole.\nSo far, pXRF results at the Python Target, located on the southern edge of the Monte Muambe carbonite, have confirmed the presence of consistent intervals with gallium mineralisation. Significant intercepts from holes MM114, MM115, and MM116 are summarised in the table below. These intercepts also show visible fluorspar mineralisation.\nHole number\nInterval\nGallium (g/t)\naverage and max\nMM114\nSurface to 15.15m\n98.64 (max 542)\nMM114\n48.10 to 51.13m\n98.56 (max 229)\nMM115\nSurface to 15.79m\n65.26 (max 570)\nMM116\n10, 12, 17m depth\nNarrow veins, max 1,154\nTable 1 - Significant gallium intercepts from holes MM114, MM115, MM116\nAdditional drilling is being planned at the Python target to explore the extent of gallium and fluorspar mineralisation along strike.\nOngoing Research Work on Gallium Distribution\nThe Company has received microXRF maps of gallium-fluorspar mineralisation from the University of Exeter, where PhD student Jamie Church is currently studying the geology and metallogeny of the Monte Muambe carbonatite, under the supervision of Dr Sam Broom-Fendley. This research provides an invaluable insight into gallium distribution in fluorspar ore and, with other mineralogy study tools, will contribute to guide future gallium recovery metallurgical studies.\nFigure 2 - MicroXRF map of a fenite sample from Monte Muambe, showing gallium-enriched feldspar (yellow) adjacent to fluorspar mineralisation.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"Our Monte Muambe exploration team is tirelessly running several parallel work streams aimed at increasing the resource base of the fluorspar project and defining a potential gallium resource in the process. I am very pleased with the progress achieved on the ground, in particular the discovery and ground-truthing of 3 new fluorspar targets.\nA further update will be provided to investors once sample batches start being exported for",

Mr Sinclair is currently the CEO of eEnergy Plc (AIM: EAAS), a digital energy services company. He has held non-executive roles across a variety of sectors, including the Scottish Enterprise backed lighting technology business, Design LED.

The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodi",

The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively seeking a strategic downstream rare earths partner to advance the project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid and lithium battery electrolyte production, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company is undertaking mineralogical and metallurgical studies to assess the potential for gallium production.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

Results are expected to lead to the discovery of additional fluorspar resources which will be included in the drilling plan.\nGallium Metallurgical Behaviour During Fluorspar Recovery Confirmed\nAltona is pleased to announce that it has received from SGS Lakefields results from metallurgical testing of a fluorspar ore sample containing gallium. The results confirm that during the process of fluorspar recovery by flotation, gallium is correlated with aluminum (contained in feldspar) and negatively correlated with fluorspar. This behavior is consistent with the Electronic MicroProbe Analysis results announced by the Company on 4 September 2025.\nThese results provide further comfort that, during fluorspar recovery via flotation, gallium will report into the tailings, hence providing a potential two step pathway to recover both fluorspar and gallium. Gallium recovery from the fluorspar tailings will be tested as part of advanced metallurgical studies for the production of commercial grade acid-spar.\nFluorspar Resource Definition Strategy Updated to Include Gallium\nAltona is pleased to announce that, following its announcement of 4 September 2025, the Monte Muambe resource drilling programme has started with hole MM111. This hole is designed to intersect both high-grade fluorspar ore and adjacent low-grade fluorspar ore containing gallium, which will help understand the geometry, size and grade of both fluorspar and gallium mineralisation.\nThe initial drilling programme of 2,000 meters of diamond and reverse circulation drilling is designed to support the preparation of a fresh MRE, provide representative samples for advanced metallurgy, and allow the gathering of more geological data on associated gallium mineralisation.\nConsidering the proximity between fluorspar mineralisation and gallium mineralisation, as well as the separation and recovery pathway provided by mineralogy and metallurgy results obtained so far, the Company is pleased to announce that, in addition to fluorspar, a gallium MRE will also be reported.\nThe drilling programme is expected to last 2 months with the MRE published by the end of 2025.\nSoil Samples Sent for Assay\n280 soil samples collected earlier this year were sent to SGS South Africa for fluorine assay. The samples were selected on the basis of their high gallium content (over 60ppm) as this chemical element has previously proven to be a reliable pathfinder for fluorspar. The results of these assays are expected to lead to the discovery of additional fluorspar resources at Monte Muambe.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am very pleased with the progress made in understanding gallium occurrences at Monte Muambe which allowed us to pinpoint a close geological association between gallium and fluorspar, but also a pathway to separate both minerals during fluorspar recovery. The results we have obtained so far now justify reporting gallium in the upcoming JORC fluorspar MRE. This will allow Altona to quantify this commodity, and to substantially increase the value of this asset for the Company's shareholders.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson Limited (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nOberon Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3179 5300\nNick Lovering\nAdam Pollock\nAimee McCusker\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa.

The rig is being taken to the first drilling location, on the Southern orebody the discovery of which was announced on 28 May 2025. This first hole is designed to intersect both the high-grade fluorspar ore and the adjacent low-grade fluorspar ore containing gallium, which will help understand the geometry, size and grade of both fluorspar and gallium mineralisation.\nThe Company proposes an initial programme of 2,000 meters of diamond and reverse circulation drilling which will support the preparation of a fresh fluorspar resource estimate, provide representative samples for advanced metallurgy, and allow the gathering of more geological data on associated gallium mineralisation.\nSimultaneously, Altona's exploration team is currently implementing a mapping and fluorine soil geochemistry programme which is expected to generate additional fluorspar drilling targets and to further expand the resource base.\nGallium Mineralogy Confirms a Pathway to Potential Recovery\nAltona is pleased to announce that it has received Electron MicroProbe Analysis (\"EMPA\") results from SGS South Africa on two gallium-bearing fenite samples from Monte Muambe. The results confirm that gallium is contained in feldspar, with average grades in the two tested samples of 700 and 400 g/t Ga respectively, and peak grades of 1,700 and 1,500 g/t Ga, respectively.\nAs announced on 15 August 2025, these samples also contain ore-grade levels of fluorspar. Previous flotation testing results have shown that feldspar (tracked through Si and Al assays) can easily be separated from fluorspar. These results confirm that, during fluorspar recovery via flotation, gallium will report into the tailings, hence providing a potential two step pathway to recover both fluorspar and gallium. Gallium recovery from the tailings remains to be tested, and advanced metallurgical studies for the production of acid-spar will also include the recovery of gallium from fluorspar tailings.\nIssue of Equity\nAs announced on 15 August 2025, the Company proposed to issue 4,800,000 new ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") to an existing shareholder (the \"Existing Shareholder\") as warrant sacrifice shares (\"Warrant Sacrifice Shares\") in return for the transfer and subsequent exercise of 20,250,000 warrants to subscribers in the fundraise following the approval of their issuance at the Company's next annual general meeting of its shareholders.\nFurther to the update of the fundraise, as announced on 22 August 2025, the Company proposes to issue an additional 4,800,000 Warrant Sacrifice Shares to the Existing Shareholder in return for the transfer and subsequent exercise of 40,500,000 warrants to subscribers. In aggregate, the Company will issue 9,600,000 new Ordinary Shares to such Existing Shareholder. The issue of Warrant Sacrifice Shares has been structured such that the Company has sufficient headroom to issue the new Ordinary Shares without the publication of a prospectus approved by the FCA.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication is being made for these shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 9 September 2025. Following this issue of 9,600,000 new Ordinary Shares, which will rank\u00a0pari passu\u00a0with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 238,664,306.

The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively seeking a strategic downstream rare earths partner to advance the project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid and lithium battery electrolyte production, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company is undertaking mineralogical and metallurgical studies to assess the potential for gallium production.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

A project proposal has been submitted to the US Trade and Development Agency (\"USTDA\").\n\u00b7\nFollowing a successful fundraise, mobilisation of field resources has commenced for the Monte Muambe fluorspar resource drilling campaign. The programme will also advance gallium assessment activities.\nUS Policy Shift Opens Door to Altona's Monte Muambe Rare Earths Project Funding\nAltona is pleased to announce that, following a recent policy shift, the US Government has re-engaged with the Company on the possibility of providing funding support for the Monte Muambe rare earths prefeasibility study. A formal project proposal has now been submitted to the USTDA, and the Company anticipates material progress over the coming weeks.\nThis development aligns with Altona's strategy to secure long-term partnerships across the critical raw materials value chain for Monte Muambe. The Company will continue to keep shareholders updated as discussions advance.\nThis comes in the context of the US Department of Defence (\"US DoD\") commitment to invest US$400 million through a landmark public-private agreement with MP Materials, a US rare earths mining company, to strengthen the US domestic rare earths supply chain and to reduce reliance on China. US DoD has become MP Materials' largest shareholder, and the partnership includes a long-term purchase agreement establishing a US$110 per kg floor price for Neodymium-Praseodymium Oxide, thus underlining the US Government's tangible commitment towards supporting sustainable and independent rare earths supply.\nFluorspar Drilling and Gallium Exploration to Commence in September\nFollowing the successful fundraise announced on 15 August 2025, Altona has started mobilising resources to launch its fluorspar resource drilling at Monte Muambe in September.\nThe programme will comprise a minimum of 2,000m of drilling (about 50 holes), and will provide sufficient samples and data to prepare a JORC-compliant fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate in due course. The planned average depth of the drillholes is only 45m (maximum 70m) as the fluorspar orebodies outcrop at surface level and are conducive for a shallow open pit operation.\nDiamond drilling cores will also provide representative ore samples for final metallurgical studies, which will inform processing plant parameters, ore blending strategies, ultimately providing key inputs for the mine plan.\nImportantly, gallium exploration will run in parallel with the fluorspar drilling, taking advantage of synergies between the two work programmes. This dual approach is expected to yield cost savings while accelerating progress on both resource definition and gallium evaluation.\nIn addition, the Company's exploration team will continue ground-truthing gallium anomalies, with the potential to unlock further high-grade fluorspar discoveries, building on results announced earlier this year.\nCommercial engagement with identified potential off-takers and partners for the fluorspar project will continue alongside fieldwork and studies.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I welcome t\nhe renewed engagement with the US Government, which highlights the strategic importance of Monte Muambe in the global critical minerals landscape. Securing long-term support from a partner of this caliber would not only validate the potential of our project but also place Altona in a stronger position to advance discussions with other strategic stakeholders across the value chain.\n\"Rare earths, gallium, and fluorspar are all recognised as essential to defense, technological development, and decarbonization of energy sources. With its diverse geology and commodities, Monte Muambe is uniquely positioned to contribute on all three fronts.\n\"The combination of this development and of the strong backing of our investors gives us a high degree of confidence as we accelerate our work programmes. Advancing the rare earths, gallium, and fluorspar work streams in parallel will maximise shareholder value while ensuring we remain aligned with global supply chain priorities.\n\"As we enter the second half of 2025, I look forward to providing our investors with a news rich period that includes an exciting drilling campaign at Monte Muambe, expected to rapidly result in a fresh JORC fluorspar ",

The presence of fluorite had not been detected in the initial pXRF analyser assays because this device cannot analyse the chemical element fluorine.\nIt is also very encouraging that the fluorite content of these samples is significantly above the cutoff grade intended for the resource estimate to be prepared later this year (cut-off grades ranging from 15% to 20% CaF2 will be tested). The Company will therefore consider these rocks as potential ore for the fluorspar project. In addition, the samples contain over 45% of K-feldspar, a mineral that previous metallurgical testing has shown can easily be separated from fluorite, auguring of enhanced recoveries for this type of ore.\nMineralogical characterisation continues with the aim of confirming which mineral species contains gallium. Due to the chemical properties of this element, gallium is unlikely to be hosted in fluorite. During the flotation process, gallium concentration is therefore expected to increase in the tailings (the left-over materials) after fluorite is extracted. This may potentially enhance the economic and technical feasibility of recovering gallium from the flotation tailings.\nThese results also provide additional validation of the use of gallium for fluorspar exploration, which resulted in the discovery of new fluorspar outcrops announced on 28 May 2025 (assay results announced on 7 July 2025), and further strengthens the Company's confidence in increasing the fluorspar resource base through additional surface exploration and drilling planned this quarter.\nGallium is a rare metal usually extracted as a by-product from zinc and bauxite ore and is used in\na wide range of electronic and high-technology applications such as radars, light diodes and\nsemiconductors. Because of the superior performance of electronic components made with gallium, they are typically used in critically important military applications. Gallium is considered a strategic raw material by several jurisdictions including the European Union, with China having a quasi-monopoly on its production. China banned exports of gallium to the United States in December 2024, and this ban is still in place.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am very excited to see that every fluorspar and gallium result coming back from the field and from the lab is serving to only strengthen further this project and its potential economics. I look forward to starting the resource drilling campaign during the course of this quarter and updating shareholders as this work progresses.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa.

Management is confident that these results significantly strengthen the business case for the development of the fluorspar operation and highlight the growing resource potential of the project.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nIndependent laboratory assays confirm the high-grade character of the newly discovered fluorspar body, with grades ranging from\n69.72% to 93.31% CaF\n\u2082\n.\n\u00b7\nResults validate the effectiveness of gallium soil geochemistry as an exploration tool and point to further potential across Monte Muambe.\n\u00b7\nThe findings underpin and enhance the case for developing a\n50,000 tpa acid-grade fluorspar mine\nat Monte Muambe.\n\u00b7\nMetallurgical testwork is ongoing with improved recoveries in the cleaner circuit and removal of ~80% of iron impurities to date.\n\u00b7\nThese results will guide and optimise the design of the upcoming drilling and metallurgical testing programme planned for the second half of 2025.\nHigh-grade discovery unlocks further value at Monte Muambe\nOn 28 May 2025, the Company reported the discovery of a previously undocumented, high-grade fluorspar body following ground-truthing of gallium soil anomalies in the southern part of the Monte Muambe carbonatite intrusion. Mapping and trenching defined a continuous fluorspar structure at least 120m long and up to 15m wide, remaining open at both ends and offering significant upside potential.\nFive representative grab samples from trenching across the fluorspar body, analysed by Intertek South Africa, returned significantly higher than expected fluorspar grades ranging from\n69.72% to 93.31% CaF\n\u2082\n.\nThis fluorspar body exhibits a significantly narrower and higher range of grades compared to the historically known Fluorite Zone located along the western margin of the carbonatite intrusion. This presents an opportunity to blend ore from both sources, thereby achieving a higher overall plant feed grade and improving the recoverability of material from the Fluorite Zone.\nManagement is confident that these initial results reaffirm the strong prospectivity of Monte Muambe and strengthen the Board's confidence that continued systematic exploration in conjunction with detailed mapping will unlock further discoveries and expand the project's fluorspar resource base.\n\u200b\nPathway to a premium acid-grade fluorspar concentrate\nIn parallel with assaying, the Company has advanced its metallurgical testing programme at the Peacocke and Simpson laboratory. The latest optimisation work demonstrates promising progress towards producing a high-quality acid-grade fluorspar concentrate, with improved recoveries in the cleaner circuit and removal of ~80% of iron impurities to date. Discussions with leading international laboratories are underway to define and initiate an advanced metallurgical testing program in H2 2025.\nNext Steps:\n\u00b7\nCommence advanced metallurgical testwork to deliver a definitive process flowsheet and generate product samples for offtaker engagement.\n\u00b7\nFinalise and implement the next phase of resource drilling to upgrade and expand the project's fluorspar resource base.\n\u00b7\nContinue discussions with offtakers and industry stakeholders to position Monte Muambe as a strategic supplier of acid-grade fluorspar to European and global markets.\n\u00b7\nAdvance engineering and procurement workstreams with updated plant and equipment cost estimates to support robust project economics.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I would like to congratulate our first-class exploration team, led by Project Manager Luis Veloso, for delivering another step-change result at Monte Muambe. The discovery and confirmation of new high-grade fluorspar mineralisation further reinforces the strategic value of this unique asset, which already hosts rare earths, gallium, and now an increasingly well-defined fluorspar development project.\n\"In my view, these exceptional results further demonstrate the immense, untapped potential of Monte Muambe, reinforcing our conviction that it can emerge as a key contributor to the global supply of critical raw materials amid surging demand. We believe the Monte Muambe fluorspar project has the potential to significantly accelerate Altona's own growth trajectory and strategic positioning.\n\"While we assess the potential economic significance of the gallium discovery, and as we move towards our next round of drilling, metallurgical optimisation and commercial engagement for fluorspar, we are excited by the scale of opportunity this",

Grades of up to 550 g/t Ga have been recorded in rock samples - an increase of 137% over the Company's initial discovery in April 2025.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nShallow, high-grade gallium mineralisation internally confirmed\nat Monte Muambe.\n\u00b7\nOver 700 in-fill soil samples\ncollected and assayed as part of a focused, fast-tracked exploration programme.\n\u00b7\nTest pitting exposes gallium-rich rock\nwith assays of up to 550 g/t Ga.\n\u00b7\nGallium found in two distinct geological settings so far\n, increasing the potential for scalable and standalone economic extraction.\n\u00b7\nIndependent analysis underway\nto determine the precise gallium concentrations and host minerals\nIn-Fill Programme Delivers Enhanced Targeting Precision\nBuilding on the identification of three significant gallium soil anomalies announced on 17 April 2025, Altona has now completed an in-fill soil sampling campaign across several of these anomalies. More than 700 soil samples were collected, prepared and assayed using portable XRF (\"pXRF\") technology allowing for immediate on-site assay and interpretation.\nSampling density was significantly increased from the original 100 metre to 50 metre spacing down to as little as 5 metre spacing in selected areas, greatly improving the resolution of anomaly maps. This refinement provides high confidence targeting for test pits and future drill planning. Soil assays returned gallium values of up to 187 g/t Ga.\nFirst Test Pit Yields Up To 550 g/t Ga In Exposed Rocks\nGuided by the soil geochemistry data, Altona excavated a first test pit measuring 2m by 1m, which exposed weathered fenite rock about 1 metre below the surface.\npXRF assays on these rocks returned gallium grades as high as 550 g/t Ga (sample T264-5), which is 137% higher than the highest grade previously reported.\nWidespread Gallium Occurrences In Two Distinct Geological Contexts\nThis latest discovery demonstrates that near-surface gallium mineralisation is indeed the source of the extensive gallium soil anomalies. It should be noted that in the initial discovery holes MM039 and MM040, gallium is associated to high-grade rare earths mineralisation, but this is not the case with this new discovery.\nIn the board's opinion, the presence of gallium in two distinct geological settings broadens the scope for future development and significantly increases the possibility of discovering commercially viable gallium mineralisation offering the potential for gallium to be extracted either as a primary product or a high-value co-product alongside rare earths.\nSamples collected in the test pit will now undergo geochemical and mineralogical analysis in a certified laboratory to determine precise gallium concentrations and hosting minerals, as well as to evaluate potential extraction pathways. These insights will guide the design of the next phase of work, including additional test pitting and reconnaissance drilling.\nIn parallel, core samples from hole MM040, which contain about 100 g/t Ga and 3.8% TREO(1) have been submitted to SGS Lakefields for metallurgical testing. The aim is to understand gallium's behaviour during rare earths recovery.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am very pleased with the swift progress made in assessing the April gallium discovery. As predicted, higher grades than those initially reported have been discovered, and this is just the first test pit we excavated. Just as importantly, we have now internally confirmed gallium mineralisation in two distinct geological contexts, which broadens the project's commercial potential and supports the case for advancing the assessment for the potential viability of gallium recovery from this new type of deposit.\"\nNotes on assay methods:\nSoil samples were prepared and assayed on site using the Company's pXRF analyser. Altona uses a Hitachi X-Met8000 pXRF analyser equipped with a 50kv anode and specific programmes to enable the detection and quantification of Nd, Pr, La, Ce and Y, of Ga, as well as of light elements relevant to carbonatites such as K, Mg and Si. Soil samples are dried, split, and placed in specially designed plastic cups covered by a mylar film in accordance with set out Standard Operating Procedures. Rock samples did not undergo a specific preparation. All samples are assayed by a trained technician under standard conditions using both the light elements programme (30s assay time) and the rare earths programme (60s assay time), with the pXRF set up in bench top mode.

Representative ore samples have been sent to the potential partner for independent analysis, as part of a technical review of project data.\nSimultaneously, continued progress on the Monte Muambe fluorspar project, combined with the recent expansion of its scope, has catalysed strong interest from established participants in the European fluorspar market, and in Mozambique. Altona has now entered into an NDA, and is expecting to enter into another NDA shortly, with European entities operating in the fluorspar sector. These agreements create a framework to assess potential collaboration across extraction, offtake, and staged project-level funding.\nConstructive and fast-moving exchanges of information are underway under these NDAs, and the Company looks forward to updating the market as these discussions advance towards potential commercial agreements.\nFavourable Geopolitical Dynamics Reinforce Strategic Value\nThe strategic importance of critical raw materials, and the vulnerability of global supply chains, have gained prominence over the past years, amid increasing manufacturers exposure to geopolitical risks. To address this situation, policies have been created, and updated, across Western jurisdictions.\nWhat were previously regarded as theoretical risks have recently materialised in the form of trade wars revolving around US tariffs policies, as well as critical raw materials export bans by China, which have now translated into real-world impacts, with significant disruptions of industrial outputs and defence readiness.\nRecent commentary from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) highlighted that export restrictions on key raw materials have already led to production halts across several European automotive plants, with similar disruptions reported in the United States and Japan(1). Concurrently, availability issues and resulting price pressure have emerged across rare earth magnets and gallium-based electronic components supply chains(2), underlining the urgent need for diversified, reliable supply sources.\nCEO Comments\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"We are seeing a marked shift from high-level policy reflections on critical material risks to immediate and tangible impacts on critical high-technology and defence industries. This evolution is amplifying strategic interest in Monte Muambe, which is uniquely positioned with multiple critical raw materials in development.\n\"Our technical milestones - combined with a supportive geopolitical backdrop - are opening up compelling opportunities to partner with experienced players in the rare earths and fluorspar sectors. We are encouraged by the level of engagement from potential strategic investors and look forward to updating shareholders as these discussions evolve.\"\n(1)\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/06/07/rare-earths-china-s-magnet-war-threatens-global-industry_6742102_19.html\n(2)\nhttps://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/22297/expect-shortages-higher-costs-amid-china-s-rare-earth-cuts\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona is a resource exploration and deve",

This is a higher value product than the met-spar (used primarily as a flux in the steel industry) previously envisaged\n\u00b7\nAltona will now advance its metallurgical testing program aimed at generating a flowsheet for an acid-spar production plant as well as product samples for evaluation by potential off-takers\n\u00b7\nGround proofing of gallium anomalies led to the discovery of new high-grade fluorspar outcrops, which could lead to higher resource estimates subject to further study\n\u00b7\nProject development scope revised to reflect acid-spar production operation at a greater production capacity than originally anticipated\nEncouraging metallurgical testing results\nFollowing the announcement on 10 February 2025, Altona is pleased to report highly promising initial metallurgical test results from a fluorspar ore sample sent to Peacocke Simpson laboratory in Zimbabwe. The objective was to assess processing routes for producing a fluorspar concentrate, focusing on gravity and flotation methods. While gravity concentration tests yielded limited success, flotation tests delivered a strong quality upgrade from the ore, both by increasing the CaF2 concentration and by decreasing impurities content.\nFlotation tests were completed using a Denver flotation cell, after milling the ore to -45 micron. It should be noted that the aim of this initial test work was to identify the most suitable reagents and therefore only one stage of cleaning was used, and results were not optimized.\nUsing a Denver flotation cell and milling to -45 micron, the initial testwork conducted with a single cleaning stage aimed at identifying optimal reagents produced a concentrate grading 93.62% CaF\n\u2082\n. Impurity levels (including Si, Al, CaCO\n\u2083\n, and S) were within acceptable limits for acid-grade fluorspar, while elements such as Fe and P were significantly depleted, indicating that further cleaning stages could achieve full acid-spar specifications.\nThese early results demonstrate the clear potential to produce a high-purity acid-spar concentrate (min. 97% CaF\n\u2082\n) from Monte Muambe ore. As such, further metallurgical testing is now planned to develop a full processing flowsheet and generate product samples for engagement with potential offtake partners.\nDiscovery of Additional Fluorspar Mineralisation\nAs announced on 17 April 2024, the Company identified three sizeable gallium soil anomalies across Monte Muambe, highlighting potential for gallium mineralisation while also serving as vectors for identifying additional fluorspar zones.\nThe Company is pleased to report that ground follow-up of these anomalies has resulted in the discovery of previously undocumented fluorspar outcrops. These zones are currently undergoing evaluation to determine their extent.\nIn-fill soil sampling is underway, with two clear objectives: to pinpoint optimal gallium targets for future trenching and drilling, and to further delineate fluorspar mineralisation.\nThese developments strongly suggest that fluorspar mineralisation at Monte Muambe extends beyond previously known areas, indicating potential for a significantly larger resource than estimated in the Competent Person Report (18 October 2023, available on the Company's website). The Company is actively evaluating the impact of these findings through ground mapping, trenching, and sampling, with the goal of defining a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") in the coming months.\nAdvancing Towards Higher-Value Fluorspar Production\nBased on metallurgical results to date, Monte Muambe fluorspar is more suited to the production of acid-spar, a higher-grade, higher-value product used in hydrofluoric acid manufacture rather than the met-spar initially considered.\nHydrofluoric acid is the only existing source of fluorine for the entire chemical industry, across a wide range of application including for the manufacturing of the lithium compound LiFP6 which is used in batteries. The demand for fluorspar is expect",

This review was initiated, following the discovery of high-grade drilling intercepts, to identify new possible occurrences of gallium. This work has identified 3 large untested gallium soil anomalies.\nHighlights\n3 large untested Ga soil anomalies identified, meriting additional assessment.\nThe presence of gallium is wider spread at Monte Muambe than initially observed, which opens the possibility that some gallium occurrences may have higher grades than those observed in pre-existing holes\nGallium is correlated with Neodymium and Praseodymium in drill samples, therefore likely contained in a rare earths mineral, hence recoverable in rare earths flotation concentrate.\nGallium Geochemistry Review\nOn 1 April 2025, the Company announced that it had discovered high-grade gallium intercepts in holes MM039 and MM040 at the Monte Muambe rare earths project in Mozambique. This led Altona to review its database in order to understand better the distribution of gallium at the scale of individual drill holes and of the entire carbonatite intrusion.\nThe Company has now completed this in-depth review of gallium geochemistry at Monte Muambe, covering both drilling data and soil geochemistry data.\nIn holes MM039 and MM040, gallium shows an excellent correlation with neodymium and praseodymium (Correlation coefficients 0.82 and 0.86 respectively). No correlation was observed with aluminium. These observations strongly suggests that gallium is contained in one of the rare earths minerals occurring at Monte Muambe. It is therefore expected to be recoverable in the rare earths minerals flotation concentrate.\nThe potential recovery of gallium during the hydrometallurgy process remains to be assessed through advanced metallurgical studies. Gallium recovery is being integrated in on-going metallurgical studies for both rare earths and fluorspar.\nA review of gallium concentration in soil shows the presence of 3 discontinuous but well-defined anomalies, with gallium in soil up to 190 g/t (see map below):\nA linear 1.3 km long anomaly along the Western edge of the carbonatite intrusion, the northern part of which corresponds to the Fluorite Zone.\nA curved 2.2 km long anomaly along the Southeastern edge of the carbonatite intrusion.\nA 500m long anomaly located just East of Target 6 (hole MM040), on the Northern edge of the carbonatite intrusion.\nThe geometry of the gallium anomalies clearly shows that they are associated to major geological structures along the edge of the carbonatite intrusion. The areas covered by these anomalies have not been drilled so far, except for the northern part of the Western anomaly, which has seen legacy drilling for fluorspar.\nThe spatial association of gallium soil anomalies with the Fluorite Zone suggests that gallium may also be used as a path finder to locate new high-grade fluorspar mineralisation.\nThe large untested gallium soil anomalies may indicate the presence of gallium mineralisation at grades even higher than those observed in holes MM039 and MM040, and require additional assessment, which will be carried out as soon as possible and for which planning has started. This assessment will include in-fill soil sampling, followed by trenching and reconnaissance drilling.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am very pleased with the soil geochemistry results, which clearly show the presence of a large gallium mineralised system at Monte Muambe, justifying a specific work program. These anomalies being untested, this opens the possibility that mineralised zones with higher grades than those observed so far exist, and that more exciting gallium discoveries will be made in the near future.\nThe potential recovery of gallium as a co-product of rare earths, and as an additional source of revenue, is also very encouraging, and we have adjusted our on-going metallurgical testing program to assess this\"\nFigure 1:\nGa soil results map.

Gallium is considered a strategic raw material by several jurisdictions including the European Union, with China having a quasi-monopoly on its production. The price of gallium is currently at about US$ 250 per kg, The recent ban of gallium and germanium exports to the United States has propelled gallium to its highest price since 2011, at US$ 585 per kg in December 2024.\nThe price shift in gallium, and recent discoveries of high-grade gallium associated to rare earths in carbonatites, has prompted Altona to review its drilling data for this metal. Gallium is one of the trace elements which were analysed by Intertek Laboratories in the course of the preparation of our rare earths mineral resource estimate. Several high-grade gallium intercepts were noted in diamond drilling holes MM039 and MM040, with grades up to 232 g/t Ga.\nThe Company is pleased to announce the following significant gallium intercepts:\nHole ID\nFrom\nLength and Grade\nMM039\nsurface\n100 m @ 77 g/t Ga\nincluding\n70.85m\n14.89m @ 141 g/t Ga\nMM040\n37.3m\n3.14 m @ 87 g/t Ga\nMM040\n57.4m\n25.53m @ 68 g/t Ga\nMM040\n108.2m\n32.27m @ 73 g/t Ga\nincluding\n115.9m\n5.53m @ 134 g/t Ga\nHole MM039 is located at the Northern End of the Fluorite Zone and also contains high-grade rare earths and fluorspar intercepts. It is noteworthy that gallium mineralisation is continuous along the entire length of the hole.\nHole MM040 is located on Target 6, which has identified high-grade rare earths mineralisation but has seen relatively little drilling so far in comparison to Target 1 and Target 4.\nThis discovery could potentially change the economics of some of the rare earths ore bodies at Monte Muambe, in particular Target 6, by providing an additional valuable by-product. The lateral extension of gallium mineralisation is unknown and will be assessed as part of the next field work campaign.\nThe Company will now check the potential recoverability of gallium, starting with establishing the exact mineralogy of gallium mineralisation, which is presently unknown. The Company will also immediately start reviewing the Monte Muambe soil sampling database, which includes first-pass XRF gallium assays, to identify any possible gallium anomalies in soil.\nFluorspar scoping study progress\nThe Company confirms that the fluorspar samples have been delivered to Peacocke & Simpson laboratory in Zimbabwe for gravity separation and flotation tests, and that the testing process has started. The delay in the delivery was the result of logistical difficulties caused by post-election instability in Mozambique, which has now subsided. Results from this testing are expected during the course of April.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"Carbonatites systems typically host a wide range of minerals. Monte Muambe is no stranger to this, with the presence of rare earths and fluorspar. The discovery of gallium mineralisation in parts of the carbonatite intrusion that have seen less exploration so far is a positive development for us and underpins the potential for additional discoveries at Monte Muambe.\n\"While current work on the potential for short-term fluorspar production continues, we will initially carefully assess the possibility of recovering gallium as a by-product of rare earths and/or fluorspar, and the potential extent of gallium mineralisation at surface level.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAlton",

The Company is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange with the ticker \"REE\". The Company currently holds copper, fluorspar and rare earths projects.\nThe Monte Muambe rare earths and fluorspar project is located in Northwest Mozambique. The Project was acquired in June 2021, and the Company has so far drilled over 7,800m, and defined a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6 million tons at 2.42% TREO. A Competent Person Report including the Scoping Study for Monte Muambe was published on 18 October 2023. The Project is now at Prefeasibility Study stage, with a focus on metallurgical testing for rare earths extraction.\nThe Company is also assessing the possibility of rapidly putting in production high-grade fluorspar veins occurring at Monte Muambe along the western margin of the rare earth bearing carbonatite intrusion.\nAltona is presently diversifying its portfolio by acquiring a limited number of critical raw material projects to complement Monte Muambe. The acquisitions of the Kabompo South copper project in Zambia and of the Sesana copper-silver project in Botswana, located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine, represent the first steps towards the implementation of this expanded strategy.\nOperational Review\nMonte Muambe Rare Earths\nDuring the reported period, activities at the Monte Muambe rare earth project were focused on continuing to derisk the project through securing a mining licence and through metallurgical testing.\nThe mining licence was approved shortly after the end of the reported period (see below), and significant progress was make in securing associated landrights (locally known as\nDUAT\n).\nMetallurgical testing for rare earths recovery was undertaken at SGS Lakefields in Canada. The main objective of this testing was to further constrain the parameters of the flotation part of the process. An increase in the flotation concentrate grade will result in significant reduction of the opex and capex of the hydrometallurgical part process, for which the flotation concentrate is an input.\nSo far, the best tests (F2 and F6) achieved a mass pull of 23.2% and 31.2% (the lower the mass pull, the higher the concentrate grade), and a rare earths recovery of 59.7% and 69.3% respectively, with a good selectivity of rare earths against fluorite.\nMonte Muambe Fluorspar\nIn September 2024, the company started reviewing the possibility of developing a fluorsp",

Fluorspar is the commercial term used for the mineral fluorite, whose chemical formula is CaF2.\nThe samples received minimal processing (removal of approximately 5% by weight by manually discarding visibly low-grade material) before being submitted to Intertek, an experienced laboratory which routinely assays commercial fluorspar exports from South Africa.\nThe CaF2 grade of separate assays on 3 sub-samples averaged 88.03%.\nThe assays also indicated the presence of, on average: 6.16% Fe2O3, 0.97% SiO2, 0.49% Al2O3, 1.08% P2O5, 1.62% SrO, and less than 0.36% CaCO3.\nThese results support the Company's optimism in the potential to produce a metallurgical grade or possibly even an acid grade fluorspar product from this ore. The Company continues to discuss potential off taking terms with various trading houses who have been encouraged by these results.\nScoping study progress\nIn the light of these results, Altona is proceeding with metallurgical testing with Peacocke Simpson laboratories in Zimbabwe to assess processing options available to produce a commercial fluorspar product.\nThe Company has also started discussions with processing equipment supplier Appropriate Processing Technologies, based in South Africa, which specialises in constructing small and medium size gravity separation and flotation plants, designed to be modular and easy to mobilize. This approach supports Altona's desire to achieve fluorspar production from Monte Muambe in the most efficient, quickest and cost-effective manner possible.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am very pleased with these assay results which, as far as CaF2 grade is concerned, exceed our expectations. With the fluorspar production scoping study in progress, and the Mining Licence in place, we are getting closer to our objective of producing 15,000 to 20,000 tons of fluorspar per year from Monte Muambe's Fluorite Zone in the short term.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona is a resource exploration and development company focused on critical raw materials in Africa.

A Competent Person Report including the Scoping Study for Monte Muambe was published on 18 October 2023, and a mining licence is expected to be granted before the end of 2024. The Project is now at Prefeasibility Study stage, with a focus on metallurgical testing for rare earths extraction.\nThe Company is also assessing the possibility of rapidly putting in production high-grade fluorspar veins occurring at Monte Muambe along the western margin of the rare earth bearing carbonatite intrusion.\nAltona is presently diversifying its portfolio by acquiring a limited number of critical raw material projects to complement Monte Muambe. The acquisitions of the Kabompo South copper project in Zambia and of the Sesana copper-silver project in Botswana, located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine, represent the first steps towards the implementation of this expanded strategy.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These included:\n\u00b7\nA photogrammetric topographic survey of the Fluorite Zone to provide a high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (\"DTM\") to serve as base for 3D modelling of fluorspar mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nDetailed geological mapping of high-grade fluorspar outcrops.\n\u00b7\nThe production of a representative 300kg crushed sample of high-grade fluorspar ore.\nThe ore sample will be split into different sub-samples which will be used for geochemical assays and for beneficiation testing. Representative sub-samples will also be submitted to potential buyers and off-takers for evaluation this month. Results will be communicated to shareholders as soon as possible and will be used as inputs in the Study.\nThe Study will take into consideration the potential production of 15,000 to 20,000 tons of fluorspar per year over an initial period of 5 years. Beneficiation of high-grade ore from the Fluorite Zone to produce metallurgical-grade fluorspar is expected to be simple and to involve crushing followed by gravity concentration using jigs or a Dense Medium Separation (\"DMS\") plant, translating into a relatively low capex. The Study is expected to be completed during Q1 2025.\nThe anticipated size and relative simplicity of this project lends itself to fast-tracking, with potential for commercial sales within 12 months of an investment decision.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"The potential rapid development of fluorspar production from the Fluorite Zone at Monte Muambe represents an excellent opportunity to monetise an additional part of our investment in this asset. If successful, it would create a cash inflow for the Company.\n\"Furthermore, this project fits perfectly in our diversification strategy, along with our promising copper exploration assets in Botswana and in Zambia, therefore expanding revenue generation opportunities for the Company.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nNovum Securities Ltd (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9400\nDavid Coffman\nDaniel Harris\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona is a resource exploration and development company focused on critical raw materials in Africa.

One of the magnetic anomalies originating from the Hook Granites coincides with a soil geochemical anomaly marked by elevated copper values. These conclusions are consistent with geological features observed on the ground in and around the Kabompo South licence area, including the characteristics of the Kamweji copper deposit and the widespread presence of hematite veins.\nTherefore, Earthmaps has, the Company is pleased to confirm, concluded that Kabompo South is prospective for IOCG copper mineralisation.\nFollowing this key and positive data assessment, the Company will proceed with further exploration work at Kabompo South.\u00a0The initial phases will include magnetic forward and inversion modelling, as well as an extensive soil geochemical survey that will allow the Company to fully understand the geometry of the granite intrusions and associated structures, and to rapidly define initial drilling targets.\nIOCG Deposits in Zambia\nIOCG deposits are an important family of copper (and other minerals) deposits sharing common features, including their association with specific types of igneous intrusions, strong structural controls (including extensive breccia) and the abundance of magnetite and/or hematite.\nIn Zambia, the potential of the Hook Granites for IOCG deposits is well recognised. Exploration efforts at Kitumba, in the Mumbwa district of central Zambia, have led to the discovery of a significant IOCG copper deposit. This deposit, located in a similar geological context to Kabompo South, has proved and probable ore reserves totalling 31.5 mt at 2.05% Cu. It is now owned by Sinomine and the ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of the mine took place in August 2024.\nCedric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"The data assessment carried out by Klaus and his team has clearly outlined a geological context favorable to IOCG mineralisation, which are known to carry viable copper deposits in Zambia. The definition of a geological model to guide exploration is a necessary first step for any mining project and this represents a significant and exciting advancement for the Kabompo South project. I look forward to implementing the next exploration activities on the ground and updating our shareholders accordingly when the next set of results have been prepared.\"\nSimon Charles, Chair of Altona, commented:\n\"These datasets from the Earthmaps team for Kabompo South are very pleasing. We are seeing our ambition to hold interests in a diversified portfolio of mineral assets beginning to take shape.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).\n-ends-\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922\nNovum Securities Ltd (Corporate Advisory)\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9400\nDavid Coffman\nDaniel Harris\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona is a resource exploration and development company focused on critical raw materials in Africa.

The US funding news for the REE would be high impact and I'm certainly hoping to see progress on that this year.  Momentum has gone again for now, warrant conversion sellers haven't helped and that took the steam out temporarily.  I haven't had time to check if the instis have been selling or just diluting, as others have mentioned we've had the odd chunky sell around.  Once that clears off the back of some more news then we should be back on track again.  The MRE should help shift some volume when released this Q.  Not one of my biggest holdings, but what I've got I'm holding tight as I expect 2026 will be a good year. Regards, Ed.",

This was in accordance with the cash conservation measures agreed, as an ongoing monthly arrangement. The number of issued shares was calculated by dividing the amount of monthly salary or fees to be paid in shares by the volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Ordinary Shares based on the last 10 days of each calendar period that the services were provided, between 1 September 2025 and 31 December 2025, at an average price of 1.64 pence per share. Admission and Total Voting Rights Application is being made for 4,817,996 of the new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 21 January 2026. Following this issue of 4,817,996 shares, which will rank pari passu with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 326,682,302. The Company has no shares held in Treasury. This figure of 326,682,302 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.",

US President Donald Trump is seeking to force the hand of his European allies, as he threatens to impose more tariffs on eight countries unless a deal is reached for the \u201ccomplete and total purchase of Greenland\u201d. Countries including the UK, France, Germany and Denmark face 10% tariffs on exports to the US from 1 February - rising to 25% in June - unless they accede to Trump\u2019s demands. The US president says \u201cworld peace is at stake\u201d as China and Russia \u201cwant Greenland\u201d. Only the US can \u201cplay this game\u201d, he adds, stressing that he needs control of the island to ensure his new \u201cGolden Dome\u201d defence system works \u201cat its maximum potential and efficiency\u201d. Trump's threat is\u00a0beyond parallel and reality, our economics editor writes, leaving officials in all eight countries baffled - and will\u00a0lead to relations taking a dive, our Europe digital editor adds. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u00a0even issued a rare rebuke, as he reiterates that it is for the people of Greenland and Denmark to make the decision about its future. And, at the same time Trump was issuing his fresh demands today, many\u00a0residents in Greenland's capital Nuuk were marching, bearing banners that read: \"Greenland is for Greenlanders\". We're pausing our live coverage there, but\u00a0we'll keep our news story updated\u00a0with any developments.",

Demand here is accelerating as governments expand solar capacity. LEDs, Lasers & Displays: GaN is also the backbone of modern\u00a0LED lighting, smartphone displays, laser diodes, and AMOLED technologies, all of which are seeing mass global adoption. Defense, Aerospace & Nuclear: Gallium alloys are used in specialized applications like\u00a0radiation-resistant components, neutron-absorbing materials, and high-performance thermal pastes. Its non-toxicity and thermal stability make it a safer alternative to mercury in medical and nuclear applications. Did you know?Gallium was discovered in 1875 by Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran who named the element \"gallia\" after his native country of France. Where is Gallium Produced? Gallium isn\u2019t mined directly \u2014 it\u2019s extracted as a by-product during the refining of bauxite (for aluminum) and zinc ores. While a handful of countries produce raw gallium,\u00a0China dominates the global supply chain, accounting for\u00a0over 95% of worldwide production. The top producers are: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 China:\u00a0by far the largest supplier, both of raw and refined gallium \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Germany:\u00a0a key secondary producer in Europe \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddff Kazakhstan:\u00a0an emerging source via zinc processing China\u2019s control doesn\u2019t stop at production. It also\u00a0leads in refining capacity, making it the central player from raw extraction to finished high-purity gallium, a major strategic chokepoint for the West.",

The US funding news for the REE would be high impact and I'm certainly hoping to see progress on that this year.  Momentum has gone again for now, warrant conversion sellers haven't helped and that took the steam out temporarily.  I haven't had time to check if the instis have been selling or just diluting, as others have mentioned we've had the odd chunky sell around.  Once that clears off the back of some more news then we should be back on track again.  The MRE should help shift some volume when released this Q.  Not one of my biggest holdings, but what I've got I'm holding tight as I expect 2026 will be a good year. Regards, Ed.",

This was in accordance with the cash conservation measures agreed, as an ongoing monthly arrangement. The number of issued shares was calculated by dividing the amount of monthly salary or fees to be paid in shares by the volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Ordinary Shares based on the last 10 days of each calendar period that the services were provided, between 1 September 2025 and 31 December 2025, at an average price of 1.64 pence per share. Admission and Total Voting Rights Application is being made for 4,817,996 of the new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 21 January 2026. Following this issue of 4,817,996 shares, which will rank pari passu with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 326,682,302. The Company has no shares held in Treasury. This figure of 326,682,302 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.",

US President Donald Trump is seeking to force the hand of his European allies, as he threatens to impose more tariffs on eight countries unless a deal is reached for the \u201ccomplete and total purchase of Greenland\u201d. Countries including the UK, France, Germany and Denmark face 10% tariffs on exports to the US from 1 February - rising to 25% in June - unless they accede to Trump\u2019s demands. The US president says \u201cworld peace is at stake\u201d as China and Russia \u201cwant Greenland\u201d. Only the US can \u201cplay this game\u201d, he adds, stressing that he needs control of the island to ensure his new \u201cGolden Dome\u201d defence system works \u201cat its maximum potential and efficiency\u201d. Trump's threat is\u00a0beyond parallel and reality, our economics editor writes, leaving officials in all eight countries baffled - and will\u00a0lead to relations taking a dive, our Europe digital editor adds. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u00a0even issued a rare rebuke, as he reiterates that it is for the people of Greenland and Denmark to make the decision about its future. And, at the same time Trump was issuing his fresh demands today, many\u00a0residents in Greenland's capital Nuuk were marching, bearing banners that read: \"Greenland is for Greenlanders\".

Demand here is accelerating as governments expand solar capacity. LEDs, Lasers & Displays: GaN is also the backbone of modern\u00a0LED lighting, smartphone displays, laser diodes, and AMOLED technologies, all of which are seeing mass global adoption. Defense, Aerospace & Nuclear: Gallium alloys are used in specialized applications like\u00a0radiation-resistant components, neutron-absorbing materials, and high-performance thermal pastes. Its non-toxicity and thermal stability make it a safer alternative to mercury in medical and nuclear applications. Did you know?Gallium was discovered in 1875 by Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran who named the element \"gallia\" after his native country of France. Where is Gallium Produced? Gallium isn\u2019t mined directly \u2014 it\u2019s extracted as a by-product during the refining of bauxite (for aluminum) and zinc ores. While a handful of countries produce raw gallium,\u00a0China dominates the global supply chain, accounting for\u00a0over 95% of worldwide production. The top producers are: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 China:\u00a0by far the largest supplier, both of raw and refined gallium \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Germany:\u00a0a key secondary producer in Europe \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddff Kazakhstan:\u00a0an emerging source via zinc processing China\u2019s control doesn\u2019t stop at production. It also\u00a0leads in refining capacity, making it the central player from raw extraction to finished high-purity gallium, a major strategic chokepoint for the West.",

The US funding news for the REE would be high impact and I'm certainly hoping to see progress on that this year.  Momentum has gone again for now, warrant conversion sellers haven't helped and that took the steam out temporarily.  I haven't had time to check if the instis have been selling or just diluting, as others have mentioned we've had the odd chunky sell around.  Once that clears off the back of some more news then we should be back on track again.  The MRE should help shift some volume when released this Q.  Not one of my biggest holdings, but what I've got I'm holding tight as I expect 2026 will be a good year. Regards, Ed.",

This was in accordance with the cash conservation measures agreed, as an ongoing monthly arrangement. The number of issued shares was calculated by dividing the amount of monthly salary or fees to be paid in shares by the volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Ordinary Shares based on the last 10 days of each calendar period that the services were provided, between 1 September 2025 and 31 December 2025, at an average price of 1.64 pence per share. Admission and Total Voting Rights Application is being made for 4,817,996 of the new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 21 January 2026. Following this issue of 4,817,996 shares, which will rank pari passu with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 326,682,302. The Company has no shares held in Treasury. This figure of 326,682,302 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.",

US President Donald Trump is seeking to force the hand of his European allies, as he threatens to impose more tariffs on eight countries unless a deal is reached for the \u201ccomplete and total purchase of Greenland\u201d. Countries including the UK, France, Germany and Denmark face 10% tariffs on exports to the US from 1 February - rising to 25% in June - unless they accede to Trump\u2019s demands. The US president says \u201cworld peace is at stake\u201d as China and Russia \u201cwant Greenland\u201d. Only the US can \u201cplay this game\u201d, he adds, stressing that he needs control of the island to ensure his new \u201cGolden Dome\u201d defence system works \u201cat its maximum potential and efficiency\u201d. Trump's threat is\u00a0beyond parallel and reality, our economics editor writes, leaving officials in all eight countries baffled - and will\u00a0lead to relations taking a dive, our Europe digital editor adds. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u00a0even issued a rare rebuke, as he reiterates that it is for the people of Greenland and Denmark to make the decision about its future. And, at the same time Trump was issuing his fresh demands today, many\u00a0residents in Greenland's capital Nuuk were marching, bearing banners that read: \"Greenland is for Greenlanders\". We're pausing our live coverage there, but\u00a0we'll keep our news story updated\u00a0with any developments.",

          "content": "Gallium prices up 600% in 3 hrs Solar & Renewable Energy: Gallium is a key ingredient in\u00a0thin-film photovoltaic cells, offering higher efficiency and flexibility than traditional silicon-based panels. Demand here is accelerating as governments expand solar capacity. LEDs, Lasers & Displays: GaN is also the backbone of modern\u00a0LED lighting, smartphone displays, laser diodes, and AMOLED technologies, all of which are seeing mass global adoption. Defense, Aerospace & Nuclear: Gallium alloys are used in specialized applications like\u00a0radiation-resistant components, neutron-absorbing materials, and high-performance thermal pastes. Its non-toxicity and thermal stability make it a safer alternative to mercury in medical and nuclear applications. Did you know?Gallium was discovered in 1875 by Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran who named the element \"gallia\" after his native country of France. Where is Gallium Produced? Gallium isn\u2019t mined directly \u2014 it\u2019s extracted as a by-product during the refining of bauxite (for aluminum) and zinc ores. While a handful of countries produce raw gallium,\u00a0China dominates the global supply chain, accounting for\u00a0over 95% of worldwide production. The top producers are: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 China:\u00a0by far the largest supplier, both of raw and refined gallium \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Germany:\u00a0a key secondary producer in Europe \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddff Kazakhstan:\u00a0an emerging source via zinc processing China\u2019s control doesn\u2019t stop at production. It also\u00a0leads in refining capacity, making it the central player from raw extraction to finished high-purity gallium, a major strategic chokepoint for the West.",

          "content": "Also a silver project with silver now $115  too rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage. In parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material. The discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar. Altona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy. With a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.",

Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage. In parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material. The discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar. Altona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy. With a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.",

          "content": "China\u2019s dominance in Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs) is protected by a \"patent thicket\" of over 25,000 filings. While most countries are still trying to master basic separation, China has moved into advanced \"mathematical chemistry.\" As of 2026, these are the five most critical patent families that serve as the \"secret sauce\" for their HREE monopoly. 1. The \"Step-Theory\" Patent (CN101319275B) This is the foundational math that makes China\u2019s refineries more efficient than any in the West. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a specific chemical agent (P507) in a non-saponified state. \u2022 The Advantage: In standard Western refining, you have to add large amounts of alkali (soap) to make the chemicals work, which creates massive toxic waste. This patent allows China to extract heavy metals in a continuous loop without the \"soaping\" step, cutting chemical costs by 30% and virtually eliminating the sludge that shuts down Western mines. 2. In-Situ Electrokinetic Leaching (CN103509944A) Mining HREEs used to mean pouring tons of ammonium sulfate into the ground and hoping for the best. This patent changed that. \u2022 The Tech: It uses electrodes buried in the clay to create a targeted electric field. \u2022 The Advantage: It \"pulls\" the heavy rare earth ions (like Dysprosium) toward a collection point with surgical precision. It prevents landslides (a common mining disaster) and increases recovery rates from 50% to over 90%, making Chinese clay mining nearly impossible to compete with on price. 3. The \"Hyper-link\" Extraction Method This is the \"Black Box\" of 2026\u2014a series of patents related to multi-component separation. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a mathematical formula to calculate the \"minimum extraction quantity\" across a 100-stage cascade. \u2022 The Advantage: It solves the \"Twin Problem\" (separating nearly identical elements like Holmium and Yttrium). By \"hyper-linking\" the tanks, the waste from one stage becomes the perfect fuel for the next. This is the technology China recently banned from export to ensure no other country can build a refinery this efficient. 4. Dysprosium Grain Boundary Diffusion (GBD) This isn't about getting the metal out of the ground; it's about putting it into a magnet. \u2022 The Tech: Instead of mixing heavy Dysprosium into the entire magnet melt, this patent covers a process of \"painting\" it onto the surface of a Neodymium magnet and baking it so it seeps into the cracks (boundaries). \u2022 The Advantage: It uses 70% less Dysprosium to achieve the same high-heat resistance. By holding these patents, China can produce military-grade magnets for a fraction of the cost that a US company would spend using \"traditional\" alloying methods.",

There are 33 \u201cadvanced\u201d projects on track to start operating in parts of the world including Europe, Africa and Australia within five years, according to Adamas Intelligence. The advisory firm, which tracks more than 300 rare earths projects globally, said there was a \u201clarge influx of public and private funding going into the rare earth space\u201d. China dominates the production of rare earths that go into the permanent magnets used in industries crucial to the energy transition, such as wind turbines and electric vehicles, putting the metals at the centre of trade tensions with the US. But building new mines is hugely expensive, risky and time consuming. Adamas said it expected demand for neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets \u2014 the strongest type of permanent magnets that are used in cars and robotics \u2014 to rise fivefold in the US alone over the decade to 2035. The race to secure supplies intensified last year after Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of some rare earths, with the Trump administration in the US ratcheting up its own efforts, including by acquiring a stake in Nevada-based MP Materials. The US has also struck supply deals with other nations. \u201cThis [2025] has been a massive year for rare earths,\u201d said George Bennett, chief executive of London-listed miner Rainbow Rare Earths, which is developing a mine in South Africa and targeting its first production this decade. \u201cIt took Trump and the trade wars to really focus the west\u2019s attention on them [rare earths]\u201d and to realise that \u201cyou can\u2019t have one country dominating such a critical mineral\u201d, he said. Efforts to bring in new supplies will bear fruit, according to minerals consultancy Project Blue. It estimates that by 2030 Beijing\u2019s share of rare earths refining will fall from almost 90 per cent to less than 80 per cent of global supply. The consultancy expects China\u2019s control of global mined supply to decline from almost 70 per cent to about 60 per cent. Shortages of the materials \u201chave focused minds in the C-suite and government on the fragility of our manufacturing supply chains\u201d, said Caroline Messecar, from price reporting agency Fastmarkets. \u201cWe have moved from a world where you might have to pay a bit more, to one where you might not be able to get material at any price,\u201d she added.",

Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage. In parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material. The discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar. Altona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy. With a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.",

This support is subject to the execution of a formal grant agreement, which is in preparation.\nThis commitment from USTDA coincides with a broader announcement by the United States Government at the 2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial. The announcement outlined a tangible commitment to reshape the global critical minerals market through the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE), alongside the mobilisation of significant and unprecedented resources to secure resilient and sustainable mineral supply chains.\nIn the meantime, the Company expects to receive the assay results from its recent and extensive fluorspar and gallium drilling campaign in the near future. The Company anticipates that these results, and the resulting mineral resource estimate, will demonstrate that the fluorspar component of the Monte Muambe project represents a viable mining project of significant interest.\nCedric Simonet, CEO, commented: \"\nThis commitment of support from USTDA is a powerful external validation of the Monte Muambe project's strategic quality and economic potential. It highlights the strong, high-level interest from a leading U.S. government institution in developing a secure, alternative source of rare earths. This partnership is a clear endorsement of our progress in Mozambique, reinforces our shared objective to advance a project of growing strategic relevance, and highlights the role Monte Muambe can play in building more resilient global supply chains for both rare earths and fluorspar.\"\n-ends-\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108 (cs@altonare.com)\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922 (la@altonare.com)\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nZeus Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nSimon Johnson\nJames Hornigold\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa. The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from ",

          "content": "That specific snapshot of CSs numbers is a mix of outdated facts and a slightly pessimistic reading of our current status. While those figures appeared in various analyst notes and forum discussions throughout late 2025, they don't reflect the cleanup the company has done over the last few months. Here is the direct reality check as of February 2026: At the end of their last audited fiscal year (June 2025), they did indeed report \u00a32 million in current liabilities. However, as of February 2026, the company has significantly \"reprofiled\" this: \u2022 Debt Reduction: They raised \u00a3600,000 in October 2025 specifically to pay off a major chunk of debt. \u2022 Extensions: The remaining \u00a3500,000 in debt has been pushed back to October 2026. While it's still a liability, it is no longer an \"immediate\" threat to their cash flow. 2. \"\u00a3109k in the bank\" \u2014 Outdated The \u00a3109k figure is from the 30 June 2025 balance sheet. Since that date, Altona has conducted two significant fundraises: \u2022 August 2025: Raised \u00a3851,950. \u2022 October 2025: Raised \u00a3600,000. \u2022 January 2026: Issued more shares to settle director salaries and services (preserving cash). While they are spending this money on drilling and studies, their current cash position is almost certainly higher than \u00a3109k, or they wouldn't be able to fund the \"extensive drilling campaign\" they just mentioned in today's news. 3. \"Zero Income\" \u2014 True (and Normal) This part is accurate. Altona is an exploration-stage company. Like almost every junior miner on the LSE, they have zero revenue because they aren't digging ore out of the ground yet\u2014they are finding it. Their \"income\" comes from investors (equity) and now potentially from U.S. government grants. Don\u2019t listen to anyone on here just do your research.",

          "content": "China\u2019s dominance in Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs) is protected by a \"patent thicket\" of over 25,000 filings. While most countries are still trying to master basic separation, China has moved into advanced \"mathematical chemistry.\" As of 2026, these are the five most critical patent families that serve as the \"secret sauce\" for their HREE monopoly. 1. The \"Step-Theory\" Patent (CN101319275B) This is the foundational math that makes China\u2019s refineries more efficient than any in the West. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a specific chemical agent (P507) in a non-saponified state. \u2022 The Advantage: In standard Western refining, you have to add large amounts of alkali (soap) to make the chemicals work, which creates massive toxic waste. This patent allows China to extract heavy metals in a continuous loop without the \"soaping\" step, cutting chemical costs by 30% and virtually eliminating the sludge that shuts down Western mines. 2. In-Situ Electrokinetic Leaching (CN103509944A) Mining HREEs used to mean pouring tons of ammonium sulfate into the ground and hoping for the best. This patent changed that. \u2022 The Tech: It uses electrodes buried in the clay to create a targeted electric field. \u2022 The Advantage: It \"pulls\" the heavy rare earth ions (like Dysprosium) toward a collection point with surgical precision. It prevents landslides (a common mining disaster) and increases recovery rates from 50% to over 90%, making Chinese clay mining nearly impossible to compete with on price. 3. The \"Hyper-link\" Extraction Method This is the \"Black Box\" of 2026\u2014a series of patents related to multi-component separation. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a mathematical formula to calculate the \"minimum extraction quantity\" across a 100-stage cascade. \u2022 The Advantage: It solves the \"Twin Problem\" (separating nearly identical elements like Holmium and Yttrium). By \"hyper-linking\" the tanks, the waste from one stage becomes the perfect fuel for the next. This is the technology China recently banned from export to ensure no other country can build a refinery this efficient. 4. Dysprosium Grain Boundary Diffusion (GBD) This isn't about getting the metal out of the ground; it's about putting it into a magnet. \u2022 The Tech: Instead of mixing heavy Dysprosium into the entire magnet melt, this patent covers a process of \"painting\" it onto the surface of a Neodymium magnet and baking it so it seeps into the cracks (boundaries). \u2022 The Advantage: It uses 70% less Dysprosium to achieve the same high-heat resistance. By holding these patents, China can produce military-grade magnets for a fraction of the cost that a US company would spend using \"traditional\" alloying methods.",

          "content": "Beijing\u2019s dominance of rare earths crucial to industries from automotive to electronics has sparked a rush among buyers to source the metals elsewhere, with more than 30 projects set for production this decade. There are 33 \u201cadvanced\u201d projects on track to start operating in parts of the world including Europe, Africa and Australia within five years, according to Adamas Intelligence. The advisory firm, which tracks more than 300 rare earths projects globally, said there was a \u201clarge influx of public and private funding going into the rare earth space\u201d. China dominates the production of rare earths that go into the permanent magnets used in industries crucial to the energy transition, such as wind turbines and electric vehicles, putting the metals at the centre of trade tensions with the US. But building new mines is hugely expensive, risky and time consuming. Adamas said it expected demand for neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets \u2014 the strongest type of permanent magnets that are used in cars and robotics \u2014 to rise fivefold in the US alone over the decade to 2035. The race to secure supplies intensified last year after Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of some rare earths, with the Trump administration in the US ratcheting up its own efforts, including by acquiring a stake in Nevada-based MP Materials. The US has also struck supply deals with other nations. \u201cThis [2025] has been a massive year for rare earths,\u201d said George Bennett, chief executive of London-listed miner Rainbow Rare Earths, which is developing a mine in South Africa and targeting its first production this decade. \u201cIt took Trump and the trade wars to really focus the west\u2019s attention on them [rare earths]\u201d and to realise that \u201cyou can\u2019t have one country dominating such a critical mineral\u201d, he said. Efforts to bring in new supplies will bear fruit, according to minerals consultancy Project Blue. It estimates that by 2030 Beijing\u2019s share of rare earths refining will fall from almost 90 per cent to less than 80 per cent of global supply. The consultancy expects China\u2019s control of global mined supply to decline from almost 70 per cent to about 60 per cent. Shortages of the materials \u201chave focused minds in the C-suite and government on the fragility of our manufacturing supply chains\u201d, said Caroline Messecar, from price reporting agency Fastmarkets. \u201cWe have moved from a world where you might have to pay a bit more, to one where you might not be able to get material at any price,\u201d she added.",

Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage. In parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material. The discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar. Altona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy. With a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.",

The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified",

Crucially, this isn't a loan that needs to be paid back; it\u2019s fresh capital from shareholders who chose to buy more of the company. This money is already earmarked for high-value work: the resource estimate and scoping study for fluorspar and gallium. These reports are vital de-risking milestones that can significantly increase the company's valuation if the results are positive. A lender chose to take shares instead of cash for \u00a320,000 in interest. This is a massive vote of confidence\u2014the lender would rather own a piece of the business than take the money and run. It also keeps more cash in the company's bank account for operations. Investors exercised their warrants at 1.5p, while the lender converted interest at 1p. Having shareholders willing to pay a premium (1.5p) suggests they believe the shares will be worth significantly more in the future. This is the one you have been waiting for folks, buy buy buy!",

Conservative numbers and now with the backing of the US government with \u2018free\u2019 no strings funding on the way, coupled with warrant cash, this should mean no fund raise for quite a long time.

Of course it's quite possible that we'll get another TR-1 soon showing that someone else has bought them... Anyhow it doesn't affect the investment case here IMO, it must surely be worth an absolute minimum of 3p today IMO, and more like 4-5p with major assay results incoming in the next 5-10 days probably.

          "content": "That specific snapshot of CSs numbers is a mix of outdated facts and a slightly pessimistic reading of our current status. While those figures appeared in various analyst notes and forum discussions throughout late 2025, they don't reflect the cleanup the company has done over the last few months. Here is the direct reality check as of February 2026: At the end of their last audited fiscal year (June 2025), they did indeed report \u00a32 million in current liabilities. However, as of February 2026, the company has significantly \"reprofiled\" this: \u2022 Debt Reduction: They raised \u00a3600,000 in October 2025 specifically to pay off a major chunk of debt. \u2022 Extensions: The remaining \u00a3500,000 in debt has been pushed back to October 2026. While it's still a liability, it is no longer an \"immediate\" threat to their cash flow. 2. \"\u00a3109k in the bank\" \u2014 Outdated The \u00a3109k figure is from the 30 June 2025 balance sheet. Since that date, Altona has conducted two significant fundraises: \u2022 August 2025: Raised \u00a3851,950. \u2022 October 2025: Raised \u00a3600,000. \u2022 January 2026: Issued more shares to settle director salaries and services (preserving cash). While they are spending this money on drilling and studies, their current cash position is almost certainly higher than \u00a3109k, or they wouldn't be able to fund the \"extensive drilling campaign\" they just mentioned in today's news. 3. \"Zero Income\" \u2014 True (and Normal) This part is accurate. Altona is an exploration-stage company. Like almost every junior miner on the LSE, they have zero revenue because they aren't digging ore out of the ground yet\u2014they are finding it. Their \"income\" comes from investors (equity) and now potentially from U.S. government grants. Don\u2019t listen to anyone on here just do your research.",

          "content": "China\u2019s dominance in Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs) is protected by a \"patent thicket\" of over 25,000 filings. While most countries are still trying to master basic separation, China has moved into advanced \"mathematical chemistry.\" As of 2026, these are the five most critical patent families that serve as the \"secret sauce\" for their HREE monopoly. 1. The \"Step-Theory\" Patent (CN101319275B) This is the foundational math that makes China\u2019s refineries more efficient than any in the West. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a specific chemical agent (P507) in a non-saponified state. \u2022 The Advantage: In standard Western refining, you have to add large amounts of alkali (soap) to make the chemicals work, which creates massive toxic waste. This patent allows China to extract heavy metals in a continuous loop without the \"soaping\" step, cutting chemical costs by 30% and virtually eliminating the sludge that shuts down Western mines. 2. In-Situ Electrokinetic Leaching (CN103509944A) Mining HREEs used to mean pouring tons of ammonium sulfate into the ground and hoping for the best. This patent changed that. \u2022 The Tech: It uses electrodes buried in the clay to create a targeted electric field. \u2022 The Advantage: It \"pulls\" the heavy rare earth ions (like Dysprosium) toward a collection point with surgical precision. It prevents landslides (a common mining disaster) and increases recovery rates from 50% to over 90%, making Chinese clay mining nearly impossible to compete with on price. 3. The \"Hyper-link\" Extraction Method This is the \"Black Box\" of 2026\u2014a series of patents related to multi-component separation. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a mathematical formula to calculate the \"minimum extraction quantity\" across a 100-stage cascade. \u2022 The Advantage: It solves the \"Twin Problem\" (separating nearly identical elements like Holmium and Yttrium). By \"hyper-linking\" the tanks, the waste from one stage becomes the perfect fuel for the next. This is the technology China recently banned from export to ensure no other country can build a refinery this efficient. 4. Dysprosium Grain Boundary Diffusion (GBD) This isn't about getting the metal out of the ground; it's about putting it into a magnet. \u2022 The Tech: Instead of mixing heavy Dysprosium into the entire magnet melt, this patent covers a process of \"painting\" it onto the surface of a Neodymium magnet and baking it so it seeps into the cracks (boundaries). \u2022 The Advantage: It uses 70% less Dysprosium to achieve the same high-heat resistance. By holding these patents, China can produce military-grade magnets for a fraction of the cost that a US company would spend using \"traditional\" alloying methods.",

          "content": "Beijing\u2019s dominance of rare earths crucial to industries from automotive to electronics has sparked a rush among buyers to source the metals elsewhere, with more than 30 projects set for production this decade. There are 33 \u201cadvanced\u201d projects on track to start operating in parts of the world including Europe, Africa and Australia within five years, according to Adamas Intelligence. The advisory firm, which tracks more than 300 rare earths projects globally, said there was a \u201clarge influx of public and private funding going into the rare earth space\u201d. China dominates the production of rare earths that go into the permanent magnets used in industries crucial to the energy transition, such as wind turbines and electric vehicles, putting the metals at the centre of trade tensions with the US. But building new mines is hugely expensive, risky and time consuming. Adamas said it expected demand for neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets \u2014 the strongest type of permanent magnets that are used in cars and robotics \u2014 to rise fivefold in the US alone over the decade to 2035. The race to secure supplies intensified last year after Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of some rare earths, with the Trump administration in the US ratcheting up its own efforts, including by acquiring a stake in Nevada-based MP Materials. The US has also struck supply deals with other nations. \u201cThis [2025] has been a massive year for rare earths,\u201d said George Bennett, chief executive of London-listed miner Rainbow Rare Earths, which is developing a mine in South Africa and targeting its first production this decade. \u201cIt took Trump and the trade wars to really focus the west\u2019s attention on them [rare earths]\u201d and to realise that \u201cyou can\u2019t have one country dominating such a critical mineral\u201d, he said. Efforts to bring in new supplies will bear fruit, according to minerals consultancy Project Blue. It estimates that by 2030 Beijing\u2019s share of rare earths refining will fall from almost 90 per cent to less than 80 per cent of global supply. The consultancy expects China\u2019s control of global mined supply to decline from almost 70 per cent to about 60 per cent. Shortages of the materials \u201chave focused minds in the C-suite and government on the fragility of our manufacturing supply chains\u201d, said Caroline Messecar, from price reporting agency Fastmarkets. \u201cWe have moved from a world where you might have to pay a bit more, to one where you might not be able to get material at any price,\u201d she added.",

Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage. In parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material. The discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar. Altona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy. With a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.",

Based on recent 2026 developments and typical agency benchmarks, you can expect the USTDA (US Trade and Development Agency) to provide a grant in the range of $1 million to $1.5 million to Altona Rare Earths for its Monte Muambe project. Benchmarking Against Recent Critical Mineral Grants Recent USTDA grants for similar mining expansions in Africa fall consistently within this narrow band: Zambia Metalex Project (Feb 2026): The USTDA just issued a $1,410,719 grant for a copper and cobalt production expansion study. Standard USTDA Grant Size: The agency\u2019s historical average for feasibility studies is approximately $400,000 to $500,000, but \"high-impact\" critical mineral projects in 2025-2026 frequently receive \"top-tier\" awards closer to $1.5 million. Specific Scope for Altona The USTDA support is explicitly intended to fund the technical and financial pathway\u2014specifically the Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS). Deliverables: This grant will pay for a qualified US-based contractor to conduct geological data collection, metallurgical testing, and an environmental impact assessment. Cost-Sharing: These grants typically require a cost-share from the recipient, meaning Altona will likely need to cover a portion of the study's total cost. $1-5m. Prove it up and get to a PFS. Then they have to apply for a cost sharing model so dilution coming.",

          "content": "The most potent argument against a dampening outlook is the recent confirmation of support from the U.S. Trade & Development Agency (USTDA) for Altona\u2019s Monte Muambe project in Mozambique.\u00a0This is not just a financial nod, it is a geopolitical endorsement. The U.S. is aggressively seeking to break the Chinese monopoly on rare earth elements (REEs).  Government involvement typically smooths the path for further institutional funding and provides a safety net that purely private ventures lack. Dampening of the share price often ignores the specific quality of the resource. Monte Muambe is rich in Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These are magnet metals critical for EV motors, wind turbines, and defense systems.\u00a0 As global electrification accelerates toward 2030, the demand for NdPr is projected to outpace supply, making Altona\u2019s asset increasingly un-dampenable in the long term.  Investors often focus solely on rare earths, but Altona\u2019s recent drilling has uncovered high-grade fluorspar and gallium.\u00a0 Recent assay results suggest that the fluorspar component could underpin a standalone mining project. With China\u2019s 2023 export restrictions on gallium (critical for semiconductors), any non-Chinese source becomes a premium asset. As of early February 2026, despite a massive 76%+ surge following the US support news, Altona\u2019s market cap remains relatively small (around \u00a34.25 million).\u00a0 For a project with explicit U.S. government interest and a defined technical pathway, this valuation is seen by many analysts as significantly oversold. While individual retail traders might be cautious, the entry of government agencies often precedes institutional buy orders, which can lead to a sustained rerating. This has not even started to rise yet, just watch.",

          "content": "Based on the rapid-fire news over the last 48 hours (Feb 9\u201311, 2026), here is the exact snapshot of where Altona (REE) stands and the specific trajectory for the \"hard cash\" you're looking for. 1. Where Altona is Exactly Now The company is currently in the \"Contract Preparation\" phase. The U.S. Government (via the USTDA) has officially moved past the \"investigation\" stage and has publicly confirmed its intention to fund the Monte Muambe project. \u2022 The Status: The \"Formal Grant Agreement\" is being drafted as we speak. \u2022 Recent Momentum: The share price has stabilized around 2.2p\u20132.5p after a 70%+ spike, with the market now waiting for the specific dollar amount of the grant. 2. Timeframe for \"Hard Cash\" \u2022 Grant Signing (1\u20134 Weeks): You can expect the official signing ceremony and the announcement of the initial cash injection (likely $2M\u2013$5M for the Pre-Feasibility Study) by the end of February or early March. \u2022 The \"Big Money\" ($25M+): Large-scale capital for mine construction (likely via the U.S. EXIM Bank or DFC) typically follows the completion of the study funded by the grant. If the U.S. stays \"hard and heavy\" on the \"America First\" critical minerals push, this larger financing package would likely be tabled toward late 2026. 3. Potential Share Price: Year-End 2026 If the U.S. follows through with the heavy backing for fluorspar and gallium (commodities they are currently 100% dependent on for defense and AI chips), here is the price potential: \u2022 Q1/Q2 Target (6p\u20139p): Driven by the signing of the grant and the Assay Results (due \"shortly\") proving the high-grade gallium/fluorspar. This would hit your \u00a320M market cap goal. \u2022 Year-End Target (12p\u201318p): If the U.S. formalizes a strategic investment of $20M+, the stock would likely trade at a significant premium. At 15p, the company would have roughly a \u00a355M market cap.",

Based on recent 2026 developments and typical agency benchmarks, you can expect the USTDA (US Trade and Development Agency) to provide a grant in the range of $1 million to $1.5 million to Altona Rare Earths for its Monte Muambe project. Benchmarking Against Recent Critical Mineral Grants Recent USTDA grants for similar mining expansions in Africa fall consistently within this narrow band: Zambia Metalex Project (Feb 2026): The USTDA just issued a $1,410,719 grant for a copper and cobalt production expansion study. Standard USTDA Grant Size: The agency\u2019s historical average for feasibility studies is approximately $400,000 to $500,000, but \"high-impact\" critical mineral projects in 2025-2026 frequently receive \"top-tier\" awards closer to $1.5 million. Specific Scope for Altona The USTDA support is explicitly intended to fund the technical and financial pathway\u2014specifically the Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS). Deliverables: This grant will pay for a qualified US-based contractor to conduct geological data collection, metallurgical testing, and an environmental impact assessment. Cost-Sharing: These grants typically require a cost-share from the recipient, meaning Altona will likely need to cover a portion of the study's total cost. $1-5m. Prove it up and get to a PFS. Then they have to apply for a cost sharing model so dilution coming.",

Crucially, this isn't a loan that needs to be paid back; it\u2019s fresh capital from shareholders who chose to buy more of the company. This money is already earmarked for high-value work: the resource estimate and scoping study for fluorspar and gallium. These reports are vital de-risking milestones that can significantly increase the company's valuation if the results are positive. A lender chose to take shares instead of cash for \u00a320,000 in interest. This is a massive vote of confidence\u2014the lender would rather own a piece of the business than take the money and run. It also keeps more cash in the company's bank account for operations. Investors exercised their warrants at 1.5p, while the lender converted interest at 1p. Having shareholders willing to pay a premium (1.5p) suggests they believe the shares will be worth significantly more in the future. This is the one you have been waiting for folks, buy buy buy!",

As someone said, without trawling through historic holdings data it's hard to know how much they paid for them - if it was 1p or so then they may be just acting like PIs do, \"sell half and let the other half run for free\". Of course it's quite possible that we'll get another TR-1 soon showing that someone else has bought them... Anyhow it doesn't affect the investment case here IMO, it must surely be worth an absolute minimum of 3p today IMO, and more like 4-5p with major assay results incoming in the next 5-10 days probably. Just my view NAI",

Just shows even major investors don't always know when good news is about to land. Of course, the 4% they did sell today would be worth a cool Million more than this time last week.

          "content": "That specific snapshot of CSs numbers is a mix of outdated facts and a slightly pessimistic reading of our current status. While those figures appeared in various analyst notes and forum discussions throughout late 2025, they don't reflect the cleanup the company has done over the last few months. Here is the direct reality check as of February 2026: At the end of their last audited fiscal year (June 2025), they did indeed report \u00a32 million in current liabilities. However, as of February 2026, the company has significantly \"reprofiled\" this: \u2022 Debt Reduction: They raised \u00a3600,000 in October 2025 specifically to pay off a major chunk of debt. \u2022 Extensions: The remaining \u00a3500,000 in debt has been pushed back to October 2026. While it's still a liability, it is no longer an \"immediate\" threat to their cash flow. 2. \"\u00a3109k in the bank\" \u2014 Outdated The \u00a3109k figure is from the 30 June 2025 balance sheet. Since that date, Altona has conducted two significant fundraises: \u2022 August 2025: Raised \u00a3851,950. \u2022 October 2025: Raised \u00a3600,000. \u2022 January 2026: Issued more shares to settle director salaries and services (preserving cash). While they are spending this money on drilling and studies, their current cash position is almost certainly higher than \u00a3109k, or they wouldn't be able to fund the \"extensive drilling campaign\" they just mentioned in today's news. 3. \"Zero Income\" \u2014 True (and Normal) This part is accurate. Altona is an exploration-stage company. Like almost every junior miner on the LSE, they have zero revenue because they aren't digging ore out of the ground yet\u2014they are finding it. Their \"income\" comes from investors (equity) and now potentially from U.S. government grants. Don\u2019t listen to anyone on here just do your research.",

          "content": "China\u2019s dominance in Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs) is protected by a \"patent thicket\" of over 25,000 filings. While most countries are still trying to master basic separation, China has moved into advanced \"mathematical chemistry.\" As of 2026, these are the five most critical patent families that serve as the \"secret sauce\" for their HREE monopoly. 1. The \"Step-Theory\" Patent (CN101319275B) This is the foundational math that makes China\u2019s refineries more efficient than any in the West. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a specific chemical agent (P507) in a non-saponified state. \u2022 The Advantage: In standard Western refining, you have to add large amounts of alkali (soap) to make the chemicals work, which creates massive toxic waste. This patent allows China to extract heavy metals in a continuous loop without the \"soaping\" step, cutting chemical costs by 30% and virtually eliminating the sludge that shuts down Western mines. 2. In-Situ Electrokinetic Leaching (CN103509944A) Mining HREEs used to mean pouring tons of ammonium sulfate into the ground and hoping for the best. This patent changed that. \u2022 The Tech: It uses electrodes buried in the clay to create a targeted electric field. \u2022 The Advantage: It \"pulls\" the heavy rare earth ions (like Dysprosium) toward a collection point with surgical precision. It prevents landslides (a common mining disaster) and increases recovery rates from 50% to over 90%, making Chinese clay mining nearly impossible to compete with on price. 3. The \"Hyper-link\" Extraction Method This is the \"Black Box\" of 2026\u2014a series of patents related to multi-component separation. \u2022 The Tech: It uses a mathematical formula to calculate the \"minimum extraction quantity\" across a 100-stage cascade. \u2022 The Advantage: It solves the \"Twin Problem\" (separating nearly identical elements like Holmium and Yttrium). By \"hyper-linking\" the tanks, the waste from one stage becomes the perfect fuel for the next. This is the technology China recently banned from export to ensure no other country can build a refinery this efficient. 4. Dysprosium Grain Boundary Diffusion (GBD) This isn't about getting the metal out of the ground; it's about putting it into a magnet. \u2022 The Tech: Instead of mixing heavy Dysprosium into the entire magnet melt, this patent covers a process of \"painting\" it onto the surface of a Neodymium magnet and baking it so it seeps into the cracks (boundaries). \u2022 The Advantage: It uses 70% less Dysprosium to achieve the same high-heat resistance. By holding these patents, China can produce military-grade magnets for a fraction of the cost that a US company would spend using \"traditional\" alloying methods.",

          "content": "Beijing\u2019s dominance of rare earths crucial to industries from automotive to electronics has sparked a rush among buyers to source the metals elsewhere, with more than 30 projects set for production this decade. There are 33 \u201cadvanced\u201d projects on track to start operating in parts of the world including Europe, Africa and Australia within five years, according to Adamas Intelligence. The advisory firm, which tracks more than 300 rare earths projects globally, said there was a \u201clarge influx of public and private funding going into the rare earth space\u201d. China dominates the production of rare earths that go into the permanent magnets used in industries crucial to the energy transition, such as wind turbines and electric vehicles, putting the metals at the centre of trade tensions with the US. But building new mines is hugely expensive, risky and time consuming. Adamas said it expected demand for neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets \u2014 the strongest type of permanent magnets that are used in cars and robotics \u2014 to rise fivefold in the US alone over the decade to 2035. The race to secure supplies intensified last year after Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of some rare earths, with the Trump administration in the US ratcheting up its own efforts, including by acquiring a stake in Nevada-based MP Materials. The US has also struck supply deals with other nations. \u201cThis [2025] has been a massive year for rare earths,\u201d said George Bennett, chief executive of London-listed miner Rainbow Rare Earths, which is developing a mine in South Africa and targeting its first production this decade. \u201cIt took Trump and the trade wars to really focus the west\u2019s attention on them [rare earths]\u201d and to realise that \u201cyou can\u2019t have one country dominating such a critical mineral\u201d, he said. Efforts to bring in new supplies will bear fruit, according to minerals consultancy Project Blue. It estimates that by 2030 Beijing\u2019s share of rare earths refining will fall from almost 90 per cent to less than 80 per cent of global supply. The consultancy expects China\u2019s control of global mined supply to decline from almost 70 per cent to about 60 per cent. Shortages of the materials \u201chave focused minds in the C-suite and government on the fragility of our manufacturing supply chains\u201d, said Caroline Messecar, from price reporting agency Fastmarkets. \u201cWe have moved from a world where you might have to pay a bit more, to one where you might not be able to get material at any price,\u201d she added.",

Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage. In parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material. The discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar. Altona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy. With a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.",
