This exercise of warrants brings in cash funds of \u00a3450,000 which will be used to fund the fluorspar and gallium resource estimate and scoping study.\nConversion of Interest into Equity\nIn addition, the Company has received notification from its remaining lender that they have elected to convert interest of \u00a320,000 into Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, the Company will also issue 2,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nInterest Shares\n\") at a price of 1 penny per Interest Share, in settlement of the interest converted.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nThe Warrant Shares have previously been disclosed in a published prospectus. The Interest Shares, issued pursuant to the lender's election to convert interest into equity, are being issued from authorities granted to directors to issue new Ordinary Shares at the annual general meeting of the Company's shareholders on 26 November 2025.\nApplication is being made for the New Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 13 February 2026. Following this issue of 32,000,000 new Ordinary Shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing Ordinary Shares, the Company's enlarged share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 358,682,302.\u00a0The Company has no shares held in Treasury.\u00a0This figure of 358,682,302 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO of Altona, commented:\n\"I am pleased to see the increasing market recognition of the value within Altona's portfolio and strategy, and I am grateful for our existing shareholders'\u00a0support as we continue delivering on this strategy.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\n-ends-\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108 (cs@altonare.com)\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922 (la@altonare.com)\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nZeus Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nSimon Johnson\nJames Hornigold\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa. The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This support is subject to the execution of a formal grant agreement, which is in preparation.\nThis commitment from USTDA coincides with a broader announcement by the United States Government at the 2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial. The announcement outlined a tangible commitment to reshape the global critical minerals market through the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE), alongside the mobilisation of significant and unprecedented resources to secure resilient and sustainable mineral supply chains.\nIn the meantime, the Company expects to receive the assay results from its recent and extensive fluorspar and gallium drilling campaign in the near future. The Company anticipates that these results, and the resulting mineral resource estimate, will demonstrate that the fluorspar component of the Monte Muambe project represents a viable mining project of significant interest.\nCedric Simonet, CEO, commented: \"\nThis commitment of support from USTDA is a powerful external validation of the Monte Muambe project's strategic quality and economic potential. It highlights the strong, high-level interest from a leading U.S. government institution in developing a secure, alternative source of rare earths. This partnership is a clear endorsement of our progress in Mozambique, reinforces our shared objective to advance a project of growing strategic relevance, and highlights the role Monte Muambe can play in building more resilient global supply chains for both rare earths and fluorspar.\"\n-ends-\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108 (cs@altonare.com)\nLouise Adrian, CFO +44 (0)\n7721 492 922 (la@altonare.com)\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nImogen Ellis\nZeus Capital (Corporate Broker\n) +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nSimon Johnson\nJames Hornigold\nAbout Altona Rare Earths Plc\nAltona Rare Earths Plc (ticker: REE) is a London Main Market-listed exploration and development company focused on unlocking the value of critical raw materials across Africa. The Company is pursuing a diversified strategy, targeting assets with potential for near-term monetisation alongside long-term growth.\nThe multi-commodity Monte Muambe Project in northwest Mozambique is a highly prospective tenement hosting rare earths, fluorspar, and gallium mineralisation. Since acquiring the project in June 2021, Altona has drilled over 7,800 metres, delivering a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6Mt at 2.42% TREO, secured a 25-year mining licence (granted December 2024), and published a Competent Person Report and scoping study for the rare earths component of the project (October 2023). The Company is actively engaging with the US Government, through USTDA, as a possible strategic partner to advance the rare earths project through the prefeasibility stage.\nIn parallel, Altona is progressing plans to fast-track the development of high-grade fluorspar veins identified along the western and southern margins of Monte Muambe, with a targeted production of 50,000 tonnes per annum of acid-grade fluorspar over a minimum 12-year mine life. Acid-grade fluorspar is a key input in a wide range of applications, including hydrofluoric acid, lithium battery electrolyte production, and nuclear fuel refining, placing Altona in a strong position to supply this critical material.\nThe discovery of gallium mineralisation, with grades up to 550 g/t identified to date, adds further value to Monte Muambe. The Company has established that gallium will be concentrated in fluorspar production tailings and is assessing its possible recovery as a by-product of fluorspar.\nAltona's diversified portfolio also includes the Sesana Copper-Silver Project in Botswana, strategically located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine. Situated on a recognised regional contact zone for copper deposits, Sesana represents a compelling exploration opportunity aligned with Altona's growth strategy.\nWith a unique combination of critical raw materials projects, Altona is well positioned to contribute to the global supply of highly sought commodities essential for clean energy, high technology, defence and industrial applications.\nThe Company and the Board remain actively focused on identifying and evaluating additional projects that align with our investment profile and strategic objectives, leveraging our extensive network and combined industry experience to uncover compelling opportunities that can drive long-term growth.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
