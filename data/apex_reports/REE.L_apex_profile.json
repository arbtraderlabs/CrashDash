The new Ordinary Shares will be issued at a price of \u00a30.01 per share (the \"Issue Price\"), which represents a discount of 23% to the closing mid-price of \u00a30.013 per share on 19 December 2025.\nFundraise\nThe net proceeds of the fundraise will provide the Company with the additional working capital required to meet the costs of the expanded drilling programme. Meterage drilled was increased by 70% due to the encouraging results of the initial holes as reported to investors on 15 December 2025, which also resulted in an increased number of samples dispatched to South Africa for geochemical assays.\nThis is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage. Assay results are expected in early 2026 and once received they will be rapidly used to prepare and publish the project's MRE.\nExercise of Warrants\nIt is noted that application for the Admission of the 5,000,000 warrants over shares at a price of \u00a30.01 per share to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, as announced on 15 December 2025 (the \"Warrant Shares\"), was previously reported to be on 19 December 2025. Admission in respect of the Warrant Shares will now be made on 6 January 2026.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Subscription Shares to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Subscription Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares and it is expected that admission will become effective and dealings commence at 8:00 a.m. on or around 7 January 2026.\nFollowing this issue of the Subscription Shares and the Warrant Shares, the Company's enlarged issued share capital and total voting rights in the Company will comprise 321,864,306 Ordinary Shares. The Company has no shares held in Treasury.

Meterage drilled was increased by 70% due to the encouraging results of the initial holes as reported to investors on 15 December 2025, which also resulted in an increased number of samples dispatched to South Africa for geochemical assays.\nThis is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage.

Most holes have encountered visible fluorspar mineralization.\nThe meterage drilled exceeds by 70% the originally planned 2,000m. The drilling program was expanded due to the encouraging results of the initial holes and to the discovery of new targets, announced on 28 October 2025. This expansion is expected to result in additional fluorspar Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") tonnage.\nSamples dispatched to South African laboratories, data collection completed\n3,160 geochemical samples and 3 representative metallurgical samples of fluorspar-gallium ore have been dispatched to assay and metallurgical testing laboratories in South Africa. Assay results are expected in early 2026 and once received they will be rapidly used to prepare and publish the project's MRE.\nData collection on site was completed, including logging, density measurements, and Real Time Kinetic (\"RTK\") topography surveying of the different fluorspar areas. The RTK survey will allow the Company to prepare reliable, high-resolution digital terrain models which are necessary for MRE calculations.\nAs part of the requirements for the planned fluorspar and gallium JORC MRE, competent person Joshua Hattingh carried out the site visit from 18 to 21 November 2025. The site visit enabled Mr Hattingh to verify both historical and new drilling collars, and the implementation of drilling, logging, sampling and surveying standard operating procedures. Mr Hattingh also visited the sample assay laboratory in South Africa.\nUSTDA engagement for the Monte Muambe rare earths project continues to progress\nThe Company is pleased to report that engagements with the USTDA with respect to possible funding of the rare earths Prefeasibility Study have resumed after the end of the US Government shutdown and are progressing rapidly, with an expected decision in early 2026.\nBusiness development activities\nIn line with the diversification strategy announced in 2024, the Company continues to assess the possible low-cost acquisition of mineral assets having potential for low capex, rapid development, and cash flow generation, in order to create a long-term pipeline of projects. It is expected that at least one such project will be acquired in the first half of 2026.\nExercise of Warrants\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has received a Notice of Exercise from an existing warrant holder in respect of 5 million warrants over shares at a price of 1 pence per ordinary share.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication is being made for the new ordinary shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange which is expected to be on or around 19 December 2025.

The Company is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange with the ticker \"REE\". The Company currently holds copper, fluorspar and rare earths projects.\nThe Monte Muambe rare earths and fluorspar projects is located in Northwest Mozambique. The Project was acquired in June 2021, and the Company has so far drilled over 7,800m, and defined a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 13.6 million tons at 2.42% TREO. A Competent Person Report including the Scoping Study for Monte Muambe was published on 18 October 2023, and a mining licence is expected to be granted before the end of 2024. The Project is now at Prefeasibility Study stage, with a focus on metallurgical testing for rare earths extraction.\nThe Company is also assessing the possibility of rapidly putting in production high-grade fluorspar veins occurring at Monte Muambe along the western margin of the rare earth bearing carbonatite intrusion.\nAltona is presently diversifying its portfolio by acquiring a limited number of critical raw material projects to complement Monte Muambe. The acquisitions of the Kabompo South copper project in Zambia and of the Sesana copper-silver project in Botswana, located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine, represent the first steps towards the implementation of this expanded strategy.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
