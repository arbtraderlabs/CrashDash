Cirata Symphony eliminates data silos, streamlines operations, and enables organisations to unleash Artificial Intelligence (AI) with controls from a single, unified control plane. Already trusted by global enterprises in industries like manufacturing, banking and retail, the launch of Cirata Symphony builds upon the Company's 15 years of data migration expertise.\nBy 2030, the global data volume is projected to reach one yottabyte\n[1]\n(1 billion petabytes) a year. A significant portion of this data is stored in legacy systems and multiple clouds, with the estimated cost of cloud storage of a single petabyte being as much as \u00a31 million annually. Data that is fragmented, of poor quality and inaccessible is a primary reason for the high failure rate of AI projects (approximately\n70%\n). Siloed data not only complicates current operations but also hinders opportunities for future innovation that leverages AI and advanced analytics.\nCirata Symphony is the first credible answer to this complex challenge, built to orchestrate data in real-time so it flows exactly where and when it's needed with full interoperability. More than a data migration tool, it's a platform that enables the secure use of data across hybrid and multi-cloud environments with zero downtime. Cirata Symphony is proven at scale, for some customers handling over 50 petabytes of data per year and supporting over one million transactions per minute.\nConsistent with our previous updates, the market for data, AI solutions and advanced analytics is experiencing rapid growth, and Cirata is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend by providing secure, petabyte-scale data management and migration solutions to the world's largest enterprises.\nPaul Scott Murphy, Chief Technology Officer, Cirata,\nsays:\n\"Cirata Symphony is a data orchestration platform that solves the problem of managing the use of large datasets across multiple technologies, a challenge that is getting harder for organisations, especially with AI driving further exponential data growth. Cirata Symphony simplifies the inherent complexity of data environments by coordinating your data systems, working with your existing storage, compute and network infrastructure to provide secure, governed and intelligent orchestration. Cirata Symphony means you can focus on using your data strategically instead of wrestling with technical complexity.\"\nStephen Kelly, CEO of Cirata\n, says:\n\"We're launching Cirata Symphony to help enterprises win in the AI era, when they are experiencing an overwhelming data explosion. Today's tools were built to migrate data-they weren't designed to orchestrate data, govern it, and activate it in real time. Cirata Symphony is the answer to the immense weight and complexity of enterprise data. The future belongs to those who can move, manage, and activate data across enterprise clouds without compromise and exploit AI responsibly. With Cirata Symphony, we've eliminated the issue of data gravity. No more vendor lock-in. No more latency. Just usable data, flowing freely to fuel an AI and analytics world.\"\n-\nENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nCirata\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer\nRicardo Moura, Chief Financial Officer\nDaniel Hayes, Investor Relations\n+1 (925) 380 1728\nFTI Consulting\nMatt Dixon / Kwaku Aning / Usama Ali\n+44 (0)20 3727 1137\nStifel\n(Nomad and Joint Broker)\nFred Walsh / Brough Ransom / Ben Good\n+44 (0)20 7710 7600\nPanmure Liberum\n(Joint Broker)\nMax Jones / John More\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nAbout Cirata:\nCirata unlocks growth for large global enterprises by automating the process of moving and organising valuable data at scale, quickly and securely, with zero downtime. Its robust automated solution handles the heavy lifting, enabling the migration of petabytes of file-based data from legacy systems in real-time, ensuring no disruption to business.

A recorded video interview with Stephen Kelly, CEO of Cirata, where he discusses Q3 FY24 and progress of the business to date can be found\nhere\n.\nSummary\n\u00b7\nBookings for Q3 2024 of $1.7m were in line with Q2 2024 and Q3 FY2023\n\u00b7\nGuidance retained for FY24 bookings at $13-$15m, YTD $4.1m\n\u00b7\n$983,010 renewal of Data Integration (\"DI\") disaster recovery use case for a global insurer\n\u00b7\n16 contracts signed, of which 8 contracts relate to Data Integration\n\u00b7\nRetirement of unutilized prepaids of $1.7m that will help pipeline development, GTM activities and conversion\n\u00b7\nRelease of Live Data Migrator ('LDM') 2.6 with initial support for Apache Iceberg\n\u00b7\nOn track to achieve $20m annualised cost run rate as we exit FY24\n\u00b7\nCash position of $12.9m as at 30 September 2024\n\u00b7\nPost quarter end; strengthened board, with the appointment of two Non-Executive Directors\nTrading Update\nBookings in Q3 2024 were $1.7m (Q3 2023: $1.7m), with the business mix driven by DI growth, accounting for 82% of bookings and DevOps software accounting for 18% of bookings.\nIn total, 16 new contracts were signed in the quarter of which 8 were DI (Q3 2023: 4 DI).\nRenewals secured in the quarter for DI included the Health Care Service Corporation ('HCSC') for a value of $983,000, implementing DI for disaster recovery.\nEstablishing greater sales cycle predictability remains a key priority for management to enable Cirata to enhance growth potential. The cadence of contract activity is improving as evidenced by the uplift in the number of smaller new and growth contracts. Moreover, the sales team is more established which provides greater confidence in sales cycle management and deal closure predictability.\nOutlook\nWith the current pipeline, prospects in progress (including those delayed from Q2 2024) and three months of the year remaining, the Board is retaining its FY24 bookings guidance of $13-15m as, with strong and improved execution, it remains achievable although demanding. We believe we will continue to see improving levels of sales activity, both direct and through partners, as we trade through Q4 2024, and our Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy continues to mature.\nThe Board continues to believe that the current levels of lead generation and early-stage pipeline support the medium-term ambitions of the Company.\nBusiness Review\nAs we stated in our turnaround plan, meaningful commercial partner engagement is a prerequisite for the Company to build sustainable growth. The new management team has worked hard over the last several quarters to rebuild trust with our partners.\nWe have made strides in this regard, and post-period end were pleased to announce the amendment of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (\"OEM\") sales agreement with IBM.\nThe revised agreement signifies the commitment by both organizations to this partnership and as part of this commitment the remaining $1.7m of the prepay has been retired early. This means future bookings will no longer be drawn down against this prepaid balance, ensuring a fresh commercial alignment between both parties that will help pipeline development, GTM activities and conversion. The agreement auto-renews on a 12-monthly basis subject to both parties' agreement.\nThis announcement represents a strategic extension to the existing OEM agreement to integrate Cirata's\nLive\nData Migration\n('LDM') technology inside IBM's Big Replicate solution.\nCirata also announced on 1 October 2024 that\nAmanda Jobbins\u00a0and\u00a0Eric Collins\u00a0have been appointed to the Board as Non\n\u2010\nExecutive Directors with immediate effect. Amanda currently Chief Marketing Officer at Vodafone Business and Eric, Co-Founder of Venture of Impact X Venture partners will bring a wealth of experience to the Board.\nProduct\nThe cadence of engineering output continues to improve with important releases in our DevOps product suite, Subversion Multisite Plus, which signals Cirata's commitment to supporting the Subversion community, an important niche for the Company.\nLDM 2.6 was made generally available in August marginally ahead of plan, adding product capabilities in four key areas: improved security features, role-based access control for more of the product APIs, improved usability and functionality with Databricks, and initial support for Apache Iceberg\n[1]\nwith IBM watsonx.data targets. The improvements in this release are in direct response to customer requirements and alignment to partner technology roadmaps.\nThe new GTM organization is bedding down and leads from partners and customer activity levels are increasing and contributing to pipeline growth. The pipeline is higher quality, better qualified and more robust compared to this point last year or indeed 6 months ago.\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"I am pleased with the development of the partner engagement in Q3, and in particular with the announcement of the IBM OEM amendment and the removal of the prepay overhang. Our sales teams are engaging constructively with our partners as we see an improving ramp in joint leads. People familiar with enterprise software will know a small transaction can take as much work as a seven-figure contract. Cirata's strategy include 'land & expand' which we are seeing early signs of bearing fruit with multiple purchase orders from the same customers as their projects deliver successfully. The number of DI contracts completed in the period signals an improving level of sales activity and, although too early to call a trend, it is encouraging.\nAs I stated in the Q2 update, we are making good progress, but this is not represented in the headline numbers. Q3 was very much as expected and the deals we are tracking in our pipeline remain in play and are aligned to customer timelines and consistent with our FY24 bookings guidance.\nI would like to extend a warm welcome to our two Non-Executive Directors Amanda Jobbins and Eric Collins. Amanda and Eric bring a huge amount of growth experience and energy to the Board. I know they are excited to help us in our goal to deliver a sustainable high-growth Company.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

DI bookings in Q4FY24 were $2.2m, up 51% compared to Q4FY23. This is the strongest bookings quarter for DI since Q4FY20. DI accounted for 77% of bookings and DevOps software accounted for 23% of bookings (Q4FY23 DI 57%: DevOps 43%). In total, 13 contracts were signed in the quarter of which 6 were DI (Q4FY23: in total, 15 contracts signed of which 4 were DI). DI bookings in International were disappointing as was DevOps new business. The overall DevOps decline was 47% from $4.6m in FY23 to $2.4m in FY24. The DevOps decline is primarily due to challenging prior year renewals comparisons when multi-year bookings had been reported.\nFor FY24 overall, the Company delivered total bookings of $7.1m (FY23 $7.2m) representing broadly flat growth YoY but with a mix shift to DI.\nDI bookings were $4.7m growing of 81% YoY. DI accounted for 66% of bookings and DevOps software accounted for 34% (FY23: DI 36% and DevOps 64%).\n[1]\nhttps://cirata.com/news/article/cirata-releases-data-migrator-30\nThis was the strongest year for DI bookings since FY20 and\nunderpinned management's belief in its potential to scale with the focus on Data Integration. From a strongly negative trend (-87% YoY) in Q1FY23, DI bookings registered a positive 180% YoY growth in Q3FY24, followed by 53% YoY growth in Q4FY24. In addition, contract activity went from 2 contracts signed in Q1FY23 to 8 in Q3FY24 and 6 contracts in Q4FY24: demonstrating a stronger 2H performance.\nThe DI growth metrics supported by operating overheads that have been reduced by over 50% from its peak give us cause for optimism in our strategy and demonstrate the potential operating leverage in the business.\nThe cadence of contract activity is improving and there is evidence that our \"land & expand \"strategy is gaining traction. However, management is working to address the issues related to bookings slippage which impacted closure expectations throughout FY24 and highlighted in our mid quarter update announced on 16 December 2024 when Management withdrew its FY24 guidance. These visibility and predictability issues are being addressed by further focus on extensive sales training - from sales discovery, the qualification process and through to contract completion.\nSales and Marketing productivity improvements are a continuing priority for management in FY25. Establishing greater sales cycle predictability remains a key priority for management to enable Cirata to enhance growth potential, shortening its sales cycle and customer acquisition cost.\nCash and Overheads\nManagement continues to focus on improving operating leverage and sustainability. Management is pleased to have achieved its goal of exiting FY24 with a reduced annualized cash cost overhead of c. $20.4m, an approximate 50% reduction from the annualized run rate in excess of 40m in early FY23. Management has acted to provide further improvements on this front, anticipating a reduction to the annualized cash cost overhead by a further c.$4m. This means the annualized cost run rate will be $16-17m as the company exits Q1FY25, close to a third of its peak.\nCash overheads in Q4 were circa $5.0m and cash burn in the quarter was $3.2m. The Q4 cash burn was flat relative to Q3, impacted by the timing of collections. This is counter-balanced by a short-term receivables balance of $3.6m as at 31 December 2024 which the company expects to collect in H1FY25.\nThe Company had also been advised by InvestNI (Government Agency) in Q4 FY24 that there will be a delay to a final grant payment for the sum of circa $500,000. This is a change to the expectation of payment of the grant award and impacted the Company's forecasted cash collection for this particular sum.\nThe net cash position reported for the period ending 31 December 2024 however reflects the impact of the change.\nThe Company's cash balance was $9.7m as of 31 December 2024.\nTogether with the overall cost reduction, further changes in relative capital allocation towards the target operating model will be secured. This will provide a balance between preservation of sufficient long-term working capital and targeted growth initiatives as the business scales.\nFY25 Outlook\nThe Company is planning to\ntransition to a more predictable growth phase, and towards its Target Operating Model. Management expects improvements in the levels of sales activity, both direct and through partners and to improve visibility, predictability and sales execution. For example, elements of the GTM 'Land & Expand' strategy continue to yield growth from existing customers.\nAt this very early stage in the financial year, Management's internal plans for FY25 are:\n\u00b7\nContinued improvement in the quality of business mix and revenues towards DI\n\u00b7\nContinued high growth in DI following the FY24 trajectory\n\u00b7\nGreater stability in renewals and DevOps\n\u00b7\nFurther expense savings to provide annualized expense run-rate of $16-17m from the end of Q1 FY25. The sustainable cost base will be circa one third of the peak expense levels of early FY23.\n\u00b7\nBookings to continue to be back-end weighted with a similar quarterly profile to FY24\n\u00b7\nManagement does not anticipate a FY25 fundraise for working capital given its assessment of the current pipeline, the strategic actions to improve predictability and the significantly reduced cost base\nManagement will provide a further outlook and trading commentary at its FY24 results.\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"This Management Team came together to drive value creation for shareholders. Phase 1 in FY23 was a company rescue phase. Phase 2 in FY24 was the recovery phase and with the recent cost reductions, this phase is completed. With FY25, the company is moving into it's growth phase.\nQ4FY24 brings to a close a year in which we have done much to rearchitect, restabilize and reposition Cirata for more predictable, sustainable growth. The business is improved on almost every metric. We are driving growth in our key Data Integration product on a significantly reduced cost base.\nOur task remains to demonstrate to customers the power of our product - and, in so doing, demonstrate to our investors Cirata's ability to hit targets and deliver sustainable growth. I am heartened by our increasing understanding of our customers' preferred purchasing patterns, the strengthening of our critical partner relationships, and by our conversion in Q4FY24 of our largest IBM Big Replicate implementation to-date. Now, we must deliver more sustainably, more broadly and more consistently.\nWe enter FY25 with a growth mindset and the continued optimization towards our target operating model - reducing cash overheads by approximately two thirds from the peak of early FY23. Our 'Land & Expand' engagements with customers are bearing fruit and the challenge for this year is clear: we must deliver more of this success into an improved cadence for the year ahead. We roll up our sleeves and step into what we intend to be a material growth year, which would be the first significant growth year for the company in five years built off a sustainable cost model with operating leverage and investment capacity to drive further growth.\"\nBusiness Review.\nKPI\nFY22 Q4\nFY23 Q1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nFY24 Q1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nHeadcount\n177\n193\n127\n109\n112\n116\n107\n92\n93\nOverhead\n$11.1m\n$9.4m\n$8.2m\n$7.0m\n$5.7m\n$6.2m\n$5.5m\n$5.3m\n$5.0m\nBookings\n$2.2m\n$2.1m\n$0.7m\n$1.7m\n$2.7m\n$0.7m\n$1.7m\n$1.7m\n$3.0m\nDI Bookings\n$1.2m\n$0.2m\n$0.4m\n$0.5m\n$1.5m\n$0.3m\n$0.6m\n$1.4m\n$2.3m\nDI Growth\n-43%\n-87%\n-69%\n0%\n25%\n50%\n50%\n180%\n51%\nContract\n[2]\nActivity\n2\n2\n4\n4\n3\n4\n1\n8\n6\nCash Burn\n$10.3m\n$11.0m\n$6.3m\n$7.9m\n$5.5m\n$4.9m\n$4.2m\n$3.2m\n$3.2m\nDuring FY24 the company continued to deliver against the fundamental areas of our strategy, designed to build a better business positioned for sustainable growth.\n\u00b7\nProduct investment and returns\nThe Company's growth engine is its DI product, but management inherited\u00a0a product in LDM that was unstable and not ready for Enterprise grade deployment\u00a0at scale. The engineering teams are improving this situation, establishing a scalable, stable LDM product into some of the most demanding data environments in the enterprise. The Company iterated several product releases\u00a0during the year, culminating in Q4FY24's major release of LDM 3.0: the first major release in 3 years. LDM 3.0 is aligned with our partners' and target customers' roadmaps in its support for both Databricks unity catalogue and Apache Iceberg. Product innovation has also continued in DevOps where the Company launched Gerrit Multisite 3.7 and further releases to support Gerrit 3.9 are planned.\n\u00b7\nPartnerships, Sales and GTM\nDuring the year Cirata has worked hard to renew and maintain partnership relationships which are key to our sales ambitions and positioning: some of which were negatively impacted by prior prepay arrangements. As disclosed on 2 October 2024, Cirata is pleased to have renewed our OEM relationship with IBM and retired the prepay associated with it.\n2\nData Integration contract signed included renewals, growth and new\nIn Q4FY24 Cirata also cleared certain outstanding data volume petabyte channel\u00a0agreements. The power and trust embedded in these partnerships can be most clearly seen in the commercial engagements they help us to source, most notably partnering with IBM in Q4FY24 for a top 3 US bank. This was Cirata's largest implementation to date through the IBM Big Replicate platform.\nThe Company also announced in December the expansion of our partnership with Databricks to deliver Data Migration as a service through our recently announced (\"DMaaS\") offering\n[3]\n. This is an initiative to help our customers and partners discover the LDM product and accelerate our \"land \"strategy, in short 'new logos'. In addition, Cirata expanded its partner reach through an alliance with TD Synnex - a leading global distributor and aggregator for the IT ecosystem - whereby Cirata offers its advanced migration services to TD Synnex ecosystems of channel partners.\nIn lead generation & marketing, management inherited a Company with poor lead generation metrics. The company was rebranded 'Cirata' for 2024 and enters this new year with a re-positioned product set in addition to a relaunched website and social media engagement metrics, which are starting to scale. Managements FY25 plans will reflect continued investment in the lead generation engine as the team doubles down on 'what works' from our discovery activities in H2FY24. The Company has much work to do to improve the forward visibility of the business as it embarks on the growth plans for FY25. Management is, however, reassured that the Company has landed LDM into some of the most demanding enterprise environments in the world. In addition, major blue-chip companies from the Automotive, Financial Services, Semiconductor and Retail sectors have entrusted their mission critical workloads to our products.\n\u00b7\nGovernance & Disclosures\nLeadership and challenge are an important ingredient when bringing about transformational change.
