          "content": "14 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 7710O\nCirata PLC\n14 January 2026\n14 January 2026\nCirata plc\n(\"Cirata\" or the \"Company\")\nQ4 FY25 Trading Update\nCirata plc (LSE: CRTA) today provides an unaudited trading update for the quarter ended 31 December 2025 (Q4 FY25), together with summary highlights for FY25.\nA supporting video presentation with Q&A will be available\nhere\nshortly after the release of this RNS.\nKey Highlights\n\u00b7\n$13.2m FY25 Data Integration (\"DI\") bookings; strongest full year since 2017; an increase of 181% YoY\n\u00b7\n$9.8m Q4 FY25 DI bookings; strongest Q4 DI bookings in the Company's history\n\u00b7\n$6.7m OEM contract signed, representing the largest OEM contract in the Company's history\n\u00b7\n$3.1m direct contract\n[1]\nsigned, the largest direct contract in the Company's history\n\u00b7\nCurrent annualized cash overheads now stand at 31% of all-time peak, with management now forecasting cash flow positive in Q1 FY26\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer of Cirata, commented:\n\"We ended the year with a series of records and firsts. FY25 played out as highlighted a year ago-back-end loaded with strong Data Integration growth-and Q4 delivered our largest ever DI bookings quarter; the full year delivered the highest DI contract value since 2017; and we also secured the largest direct and OEM contracts in the Company's history. The delivery of multi-year contracts with blue chip customers and partners represents growing confidence in Cirata's product roadmap and ability to execute.\nFY25 was a foundational year for Cirata. The divestment of the DevOps assets and the launch of Cirata Symphony-our Data Orchestration offering-give the Company product focus and an expanding addressable market. We rebuilt our GTM strategy from the ground up, and we are setting records for bookings with a cost base now running at less than a third of its historic peak.\nI'm proud of the expansion wins we secured in FY25 and this customer expansion approach remains a critical part of our growth strategy as we move forward. Alongside this, and as the year ahead unfolds, we will gradually put other building blocks in place to broaden our pursuit of growth. Further new product development is one important element, with customer and market validation and, ultimately as the new sales team reaches maturity, the acceleration of new customer wins. Bringing these key building blocks together will be management's primary focus for FY26.\"\nTrading Update\nTotal Contract Value\n[2]\n(\"TCV\") for DI in Q4 FY25\namounted to $9.8m (Q4 FY24, $2.3m) an increase of 326% YoY. Total contract value for DI in FY25 was $13.2m (FY24, $4.7m) an increase of 181% YoY. Total contract bookings (including discontinued operations) in FY25 were $13.9m (FY24, $7.1m), an increase of 96%. Q4 FY25 is the strongest bookings quarter for DI (continuing operations) in the Company's history and FY25 is the strongest bookings year for DI since 2017.\nIn total, 6 DI contracts were signed in the quarter (Q4 FY24: 6 DI contracts signed), of which all were growth contracts\n[3]\n.\nIn Q4 FY25 the Company announced a 3-year DI growth contract of $3.1m for the deployment of Live Data Migrator (\"LDM\") with a leading US insurer. The customer transitioned from a 1-year legacy Fusion product agreement to LDM with a 3-year commitment. This contract represents the largest direct contract in Cirata's history. In addition, the Company announced a 3-year DI growth contract of $6.7m for the deployment of LDM to support a financial services company through its OEM agreement with IBM.\nThis contract represents the largest OEM contract in Cirata's history\n.\nThe expansion wins within existing customers are an important strategic imperative for sustainable growth. Returning customers with changing requirements for data volumes, sources and targets, features and formats, together with improving term commitments, provide a stable environment for Cirata to build on.\nOn 9 September 2025, the Company announced the commercial launch of\nCirata Symphony\n, a Data Orchestration platform designed to address the challenges of enterprise data modernization.\nCirata Symphony\nwas developed in response to the findings of the Project Lighthouse strategic review (the \"Lighthouse Review\") -previously communicated to shareholders and designed with direct customer input.\nEarly interest in Cirata Symphony is encouraging and this is being reflected in lead generation.\nFurther information on Cirata Symphony can be found on the Company's website\nhere\n.\nOn November 27th, Cirata announced that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had closed its investigation into the Company with no action taken.\nCompletion of DevOps divestment\nOn 11 August 2025, Cirata announced the completion of the divestment of its DevOps assets. The divestment followed the Lighthouse Review. On 19 December 2025, Cirata announced the final settlement of the conditional consideration, with a payment of US$0.9m. The total final consideration received for the divestment of the DevOps assets therefore amounted to US$3.4m. The DevOps business was primarily renewal-based in nature. Following the divestment, renewals are therefore expected to represent a lower proportion of the Company's overall revenues. The Company is now solely focused on its Data Integration and Orchestration product offerings, which represents a larger and more sustainable growth opportunity, with a lower reliance on recurring renewals.\nCash and Overheads\nCirata has achieved the realignment of its target cost base, from a $16-$17m run-rate exiting Q1 FY25 to an annualized total of $12m-$13m exiting Q4 FY25 (less than a third of the peak cash overhead of $41.5m in FY21). The estimated Q4 FY25 exit run rate is $3.2m.\nThe cash burn in Q4 FY25 was $1.3m, representing a 59% reduction compared to Q4 FY24.\nAs of 31 December 2025, the unaudited cash position was $4.0m and short-term trade receivables balance was $3.4m, giving a cash plus short-term receivables balance of $7.4m.\nOutlook\nOverall DI bookings increased by 81% in FY24 and by 181% in FY25, primarily reflecting growth from existing DI customers. Cirata has delivered material improvements to its cost base and demonstrated increasing traction with existing customers.\nAs we go forward through 2026, we consider the continued success of our expansion win strategy to be a critical component of our growth. The additional building blocks that combine to deliver future growth will be further product development, customer and market validation and, ultimately as the new sales team beds in and reaches maturity, the acceleration of new customer wins. Bringing these additional building blocks together, gradually, will be the primary focus for management as FY26 evolves.\nData Integration and Data Orchestration software solutions are enterprise product offerings focused on the Global 2000 accounts and are expected to be non-linear in nature, with revenues and cash flows continuing to be inherently lumpy and subject to timing effects. Management expects an improvement in sales activity levels, both through direct sales efforts and via partners. With the changes led by Dominic Arcari in the Go-to-Market (\"GTM\"), visibility is anticipated to improve by mid-year FY26.\nThe timing and conversion of new business opportunities remain uncertain. At this early stage of the financial year, and based on current internal planning assumptions, Management's anticipates the following for FY26:\n1. An anticipated annualized operating expense run-rate of approximately $12-13m in FY26.\n2. Targeting cash flow positive in Q1 FY26 and planning for cash break-even for FY26 overall, subject to bookings timing and working capital movements.\n3. In FY26, Management is introducing Annual Contract Value\n[4]\n(\"ACV\") used as a key measure (KPI) of growth given ACV's close alignment with cash collection.\nKey performance indicators (KPI)\nQuarterly Key performance indicators\nKPI\nFY22 Q4\nFY23 Q4\nFY24 Q4\nFY25 Q1\nFY25 Q2\nFY25 Q3\nFY25 Q4\nHeadcount\n177\n112\n93\n71\n67\n57\n47\nOverheads\n$11.1m\n$5.7m\n$3.6m\n$4.6m\n$4.1m\n$4.0m\n$3.6m\nBookings\n$2.2m\n$2.7m\n$3.0m\n$3.0m\n$0.8m\n$0.3m\n$9.8m\nDI Bookings\n$1.2m\n$1.5m\n$2.3m\n$2.4m\n$0.7m\n$0.3m\n$9.8m\nDI Growth (YoY)\n-43%\n25%\n53%\n700%\n17%\n-79%\n326%\nDI Activity\n[5]\n2\n3\n6\n5\n2\n4\n6\nCash Burn\n$10.3m\n$5.5m\n$3.2m\n$1.4m\n$2.2m\n$0.8m\n$1.3m\nAnnual DI Bookings & Overheads\nKPI\nFY22\nFY23\nFY24\nFY25\nDI Bookings\n$4.5m\n$2.6m\n$4.7m\n$13.2m\nDI Growth (YoY)\n-52%\n-42%\n81%\n181%\nOverheads\n$39.7m\n$30.3m\n$20.6m\n$16.3m\nCash burn\n$28.7m\n$30.5m\n$15.7m\n$5.7m\nThis announcement contains inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

FY25 played out as highlighted a year ago-back-end loaded with strong Data Integration growth-and Q4 delivered our largest ever DI bookings quarter; the full year delivered the highest DI contract value since 2017; and we also secured the largest direct and OEM contracts in the Company's history. The delivery of multi-year contracts with blue chip customers and partners represents growing confidence in Cirata's product roadmap and ability to execute.\nFY25 was a foundational year for Cirata. The divestment of the DevOps assets and the launch of Cirata Symphony-our Data Orchestration offering-give the Company product focus and an expanding addressable market. We rebuilt our GTM strategy from the ground up, and we are setting records for bookings with a cost base now running at less than a third of its historic peak.\nI'm proud of the expansion wins we secured in FY25 and this customer expansion approach remains a critical part of our growth strategy as we move forward. Alongside this, and as the year ahead unfolds, we will gradually put other building blocks in place to broaden our pursuit of growth. Further new product development is one important element, with customer and market validation and, ultimately as the new sales team reaches maturity, the acceleration of new customer wins. Bringing these key building blocks together will be management's primary focus for FY26.\"\nTrading Update\nTotal Contract Value\n[2]\n(\"TCV\") for DI in Q4 FY25\namounted to $9.8m (Q4 FY24, $2.3m) an increase of 326% YoY. Total contract value for DI in FY25 was $13.2m (FY24, $4.7m) an increase of 181% YoY. Total contract bookings (including discontinued operations) in FY25 were $13.9m (FY24, $7.1m), an increase of 96%. Q4 FY25 is the strongest bookings quarter for DI (continuing operations) in the Company's history and FY25 is the strongest bookings year for DI since 2017.\nIn total, 6 DI contracts were signed in the quarter (Q4 FY24: 6 DI contracts signed), of which all were growth contracts\n[3]\n.\nIn Q4 FY25 the Company announced a 3-year DI growth contract of $3.1m for the deployment of Live Data Migrator (\"LDM\") with a leading US insurer. The customer transitioned from a 1-year legacy Fusion product agreement to LDM with a 3-year commitment. This contract represents the largest direct contract in Cirata's history. In addition, the Company announced a 3-year DI growth contract of $6.7m for the deployment of LDM to support a financial services company through its OEM agreement with IBM.\nThis contract represents the largest OEM contract in Cirata's history\n.\nThe expansion wins within existing customers are an important strategic imperative for sustainable growth. Returning customers with changing requirements for data volumes, sources and targets, features and formats, together with improving term commitments, provide a stable environment for Cirata to build on.\nOn 9 September 2025, the Company announced the commercial launch of\nCirata Symphony\n, a Data Orchestration platform designed to address the challenges of enterprise data modernization.\nCirata Symphony\nwas developed in response to the findings of the Project Lighthouse strategic review (the \"Lighthouse Review\") -previously communicated to shareholders and designed with direct customer input.\nEarly interest in Cirata Symphony is encouraging and this is being reflected in lead generation.\nFurther information on Cirata Symphony can be found on the Company's website\nhere\n.\nOn November 27th, Cirata announced that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had closed its investigation into the Company with no action taken.\nCompletion of DevOps divestment\nOn 11 August 2025, Cirata announced the completion of the divestment of its DevOps assets. The divestment followed the Lighthouse Review. On 19 December 2025, Cirata announced the final settlement of the conditional consideration, with a payment of US$0.9m.

The customer transitions from a 1-year legacy Fusion product agreement to Live Data Migrator with a 3-year commitment\n\u00b7\nCompletion of DevOps divestment\no\nOn 11 August 2025, Cirata announced the successful completion of the divestment of its DevOps assets (the \"Transaction\")\no\nCirata received\u00a0$2.5m\u00a0upon successful closing of the Transaction with\u00a0BlueOptima Ltd\u00a0(\"BlueOptima\") (a\u00a0UK-based leading provider of software engineering insights). A final consideration of up to\u00a0$1.0m\u00a0will be payable in\u00a0December 2025. Further updates will be provided as appropriate.\no\nThis divestment reiterates Cirata's focus on leveraging the growth potential of its DI business, the Company's core growth driver\n\u00b7\nFinancial Discipline\no\nThe realignment of the FY25 cost base to an annualized total of $12-13m entering Q4FY25 through a continued reduction of annualized overheads and the divestiture of the DevOps business (approximately 70% reduction from its peak), remains on track, with the Q3FY25 cost base excluding DevOps activity at $3.9m and with an exit run rate of $3.4m\no\nQ3FY25 cash burn reduced YoY to\n$0.8m\n(Q3FY25: $3.2m), this includes the proceeds received and one-off costs associated with the divestment of DevOps assets\no\nUnaudited cash position of $5.4m and short-term trade receivables of $0.3m as at 30 September 2025, giving a cash plus short-term receivables balance of $5.7m\no\nManagement expects that the early Q4FY25 bookings momentum, combined with the newly established cost structure, will demonstrate ongoing improvements in operating leverage\nTrading Update\nIn total, 4 DI contracts were signed in the quarter (Q3FY24: 8 DI contracts signed). One contract, the $3.1m 3-year contract with a US insurer that had been expected in Q3FY25, closed in early October. Sales discipline is improving, and pipeline is growing in volume and quality as a result of the Company's focused go-to-market strategy.\nTotal bookings for DI year-to-date to the end of Q3FY25 amounted to $3.4m (YTD Q3FY24: $2.4m), an increase YoY of 42%.\nPost-period End\nQ3FY25 trading reflected timing of contract completions, with bookings in line with management expectations.\nThe 3-year $3.1m DI contract signed with a leading US insurer in early October represents the largest direct contract in the Company's history. The customer commitment to a multiyear term and a transition from a 1-year legacy DI Fusion product agreement to a new longer term LDM agreement, further validates Cirata's LDM product and market positioning.\nCash and Overheads\nThe realignment of the cost base, from a $16-17m run-rate exiting Q1FY25 to an annualized total of $12-13m entering Q4FY25 (approximately 70% reduction from its peak) remains on target, with the estimated Q3FY25 exit run rate at $3.4m. Management expects that the early Q4FY25 bookings momentum, combined with the newly established cost structure, will demonstrate continued improvements in operating leverage with growth on the top line.\nThe cash burn in Q3FY25 of $0.8m represents a 76% reduction compared to Q3FY24. Cash burn includes the proceeds received and one-off costs associated with the divestment of DevOps assets.\nAs of 30 September 2025, the unaudited cash position was $5.4m and short-term trade receivables balance was $0.3m, giving a cash plus short-term receivables balance of $5.7m.\nOutlook\nManagement's outlook communicated in March 2025 remains unchanged, with bookings expected to be back end weighted with a similar profile to FY24 with continuing high growth in DI.\nThe divestiture of the DevOps business,\ncombined with a further reduction of the overheads, will bring annualized cash overheads to approximately $12m-13m as ",

Cirata Symphony eliminates data silos, streamlines operations, and enables organisations to unleash Artificial Intelligence (AI) with controls from a single, unified control plane. Already trusted by global enterprises in industries like manufacturing, banking and retail, the launch of Cirata Symphony builds upon the Company's 15 years of data migration expertise.\nBy 2030, the global data volume is projected to reach one yottabyte\n[1]\n(1 billion petabytes) a year. A significant portion of this data is stored in legacy systems and multiple clouds, with the estimated cost of cloud storage of a single petabyte being as much as \u00a31 million annually. Data that is fragmented, of poor quality and inaccessible is a primary reason for the high failure rate of AI projects (approximately\n70%\n). Siloed data not only complicates current operations but also hinders opportunities for future innovation that leverages AI and advanced analytics.\nCirata Symphony is the first credible answer to this complex challenge, built to orchestrate data in real-time so it flows exactly where and when it's needed with full interoperability. More than a data migration tool, it's a platform that enables the secure use of data across hybrid and multi-cloud environments with zero downtime. Cirata Symphony is proven at scale, for some customers handling over 50 petabytes of data per year and supporting over one million transactions per minute.\nConsistent with our previous updates, the market for data, AI solutions and advanced analytics is experiencing rapid growth, and Cirata is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend by providing secure, petabyte-scale data management and migration solutions to the world's largest enterprises.\nPaul Scott Murphy, Chief Technology Officer, Cirata,\nsays:\n\"Cirata Symphony is a data orchestration platform that solves the problem of managing the use of large datasets across multiple technologies, a challenge that is getting harder for organisations, especially with AI driving further exponential data growth. Cirata Symphony simplifies the inherent complexity of data environments by coordinating your data systems, working with your existing storage, compute and network infrastructure to provide secure, governed and intelligent orchestration. Cirata Symphony means you can focus on using your data strategically instead of wrestling with technical complexity.\"\nStephen Kelly, CEO of Cirata\n, says:\n\"We're launching Cirata Symphony to help enterprises win in the AI era, when they are experiencing an overwhelming data explosion. Today's tools were built to migrate data-they weren't designed to orchestrate data, govern it, and activate it in real time. Cirata Symphony is the answer to the immense weight and complexity of enterprise data. The future belongs to those who can move, manage, and activate data across enterprise clouds without compromise and exploit AI responsibly. With Cirata Symphony, we've eliminated the issue of data gravity. No more vendor lock-in. No more latency. Just usable data, flowing freely to fuel an AI and analytics world.\"\n-\nENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nCirata\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer\nRicardo Moura, Chief Financial Officer\nDaniel Hayes, Investor Relations\n+1 (925) 380 1728\nFTI Consulting\nMatt Dixon / Kwaku Aning / Usama Ali\n+44 (0)20 3727 1137\nStifel\n(Nomad and Joint Broker)\nFred Walsh / Brough Ransom / Ben Good\n+44 (0)20 7710 7600\nPanmure Liberum\n(Joint Broker)\nMax Jones / John More\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nAbout Cirata:\nCirata unlocks growth for large global enterprises by automating the process of moving and organising valuable data at scale, quickly and securely, with zero downtime. Its robust automated solution handles the heavy lifting, enabling the migration of petabytes of file-based data from legacy systems in real-time, ensuring no disruption to business. The AIM-listed company, with over 15 years of expertise and more than 45 patents related to data integration and management, is trusted by global enterprises in industries like manufacturing, banking and retail.

A consideration of up to $1.0m will be payable in December 2025, conditional upon the transfer of Cirata's DevOps customers to BlueOptima.\n\u00a7\nThis divestiture signals a focus on the growth potential of Cirata's DI business, the Company's core growth driver\no\nCost alignment & financial discipline\n\u00a7\nDivestiture of DevOps assets raises up to $3.5m\n\u00a7\nAnnualized cost base expected to be reduced to $12-13m exiting Q3FY25 (exiting Q1 FY25 $16-$17m)\no\nAppointment of new CRO\n\u00a7\nGo-to-market leadership across both the US and international markets has been strengthened with the appointment of a new Chief Revenue Officer, Dominic Arcari, on July 1, 2025. Dominic brings 40 years of successful enterprise solutions experience\nOutlook\nThe outlook communicated on 31 March 2025 remains unchanged, with bookings expected to be back end weighted with a similar profile to FY24 and continued high growth in the Data Integration business.\nThe divestiture of the DevOps business\ncombined with a further reduction of the annualized overheads is expected to bring cash overheads to approximately $12m-13m exiting Q3FY25.\nThe combination of cost-saving actions, DI growth and the recent divestment of assets enables Management to reaffirm the previous expectation that a working capital fundraise is not required in FY25.\nBookings\nTotal Bookings in H1FY25 were $3.8m (H1FY24: $2.4m), representing an increase of 58% YoY\n.\nDI Bookings were $3.1m (H1FY24 $1m), delivering growth of 210% YoY.\nIn total, 20 contracts were signed, of which 7 were DI (H1FY24: 31 contracts signed in total, of which 7 were DI).\nDI accounted for 82% of Cirata's Bookings value.\nDuring H1FY25, Cirata announced a $2.0m 3-year DI contract with a leading retailer, representing the first implementation of an enterprise-wide license agreement, a DI renewal with a leading Canadian Bank and the first Data Migration as a Service (\"DMaaS\") contract with Cirata's partner Databricks for a Middle Eastern telecommunications company.\nQ2FY25 fell short of Cirata's internal plan as certain opportunities slipped into subsequent quarters. The actions taken in January 2025 to strengthen sales execution in the international region have had a positive and immediate impact on progress. However, as outlined in the Q1FY25 Trading Update, execution in North America was disappointing relative to plan\n. To that end, further\nperformance improvements have been taken in the quarter to drive sales execution across the go-to-market (\"GTM\") function. GTM leadership across both the US and international markets has been strengthened with the appointment of our new Chief Revenue Officer, Dominic Arcari, on July 1, 2025. Lead generation and pipeline build improved during H1FY25 and these ongoing improvements in pipeline build, alongside enhancements to sales planning, increased trainin",

This divestiture is expected to close on or around 8 August 2025\n\u00b7\nFinancial Discipline and Governance\no\nDivestiture of DevOps assets, raising up to $3.5m gross proceeds post-period end\no\nRealigning the cost base from $16-17m run-rate exiting Q1FY25 to an annualized total of $12-13m exiting Q3FY25.\no\nQ2FY25 cash burn significantly reduced YoY to $2.2m (Q2FY24: $4.2m)\no\nUnaudited cash position of $6.1m & short-term trade receivables of $1.3m as at 30 June 2025.\nOutlook\nOur outlook communicated in March 2025 remains unchanged, with bookings expected to be back end weighted with a similar profile to FY24 and high growth in the Data Integration business.\nThe divestiture of the DevOps business\ncombined with a further reduction of the annualized overheads will bring cash overheads to approximately $12m-13m exiting Q3FY25, which underpins the sustainability of the business model and provides financial flexibility to invest for growth.\nThe combination of cost-saving actions, DI growth and the recent divestment of assets reaffirms management's previous expectation that a fundraise for working capital is not required in FY25.\nTrading Update\nTotal bookings in Q2FY25 were $0.8m (Q2FY24: $1.7m), representing a 53% decline YoY\n.\nDI bookings were $0.7m in Q2FY25, a rise of 17% YoY.\nIn total, 6 contracts were signed in the quarter, of which 2 were DI (Q2FY24: 6 contracts signed in total, of which 2 were DI). The 2 DI contracts represented 95% of the total bookings value.\nFor H1FY25 DI bookings were $3.1m, representing growth of 244% YoY with DI accounting for 83% of bookings. Q2FY25 fell short of Cirata's internal plan as certain opportunities slipped into the second half of 2025. The actions taken in January 2025 to strengthen sales execution in the international region have had a positive and immediate impact on progress. However, as outlined in the Q1FY25 Trading Update, execution in North America has been disappointing relative to plan\n. To that end, further\nperformance improvements have been taken in the quarter to drive sales execution across the Go-To-Market (\"GTM\") function. GTM leadership across both the US and international markets has been strengthened with the appointment of a new Chief Revenue Officer, Dominic Arcari, on July 1, 2025. Lead generation and pipeline build improved during H1FY25 and these ongoing improvements in pipeline build, alongside enhancements to close planning, increased training and further investment in sales personnel, will be led by Dominic.\nEstablishing greater sales cycle predictability remains a key priority for management to enable Cirata to enhance its predictable growth potential.\nDivestiture of DevOps Assets\nCirata announces today that it has signed an agreement to divest its DevOps assets to\nBlueOptima\n,\na UK-based leading provider of software engineering performance insights, for a total consideration of up to $\n3.5m.\nThe divestment includes DevOps products supporting Subversion, Gerrit and Git, enabling globally distributed developer teams to collaborate securely and efficiently with minimal latency. The transaction is expected to close on or around\n8 August 2025\n, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.\nThe total consideration of up to $3.5m will be paid in cash, with $2.5m payable on closing and up to $1.0m in December 2025, conditional on the successful transfer of Cirata's DevOps customers to BlueOptima.\nOn the sale of the assets, Cirata retains ownership of all existing intellectual property.

Business mix continued to improve with DI accounting for 80% of bookings and DevOps software accounting for the remaining 20% of bookings (Q1FY24 DI 57%: DevOps 43%), with DI being the Company's core growth driver. In total, 14 contracts were signed in the quarter of which 5 were DI (Q1FY24: in total, 17 contracts signed of which 5 were DI).\nThe actions taken in January 2025 to address poor execution in the International region have had an immediate impact, resulting in close plans hitting expectations. However, DI bookings in North America were disappointing relative to plan. Improvements will be a function of continued pipeline build, and improvements to close planning. This will be achieved through increased training and further investment in sales personnel. The\nsales model is evolving away from hiring 'Partner centric sales' to new business enterprise solutions executives.\nSales and Marketing productivity improvements are a continuing priority for management in FY25. Whilst progress has been made, establishing greater sales cycle predictability remains a key priority for management to enable Cirata to enhance growth potential, shortening its sales cycle and reducing customer acquisition cost.\nCirata's \"land and expand\" strategy continues to gain traction for DI. The Q4FY24 win with a top 3 global bank announced 16 December 2024, followed in Q1 by the landing of our multiyear contract with a leading retailer announced in March 2025, is validation of our strategy and Cirata's technology enabling data automation and orchestration within the enterprise.\nThe leading UK retailer plans to leverage the power of hybrid cloud and deploy Cirata enterprise wide at scale as the standard to make data available for analytics, GenAI and for the innovation of edge use cases.\nThe enterprise-wide licence agreement enables data automation at petabyte scale, allowing for migration from multiple sources to multiple targets. For this innovative customer, Cirata will support the implementation of open table formats (such as Apache Iceberg) to enable platform interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in. Apache Iceberg has emerged as a leading standard for an \"open table format,\" offering a streamlined and scalable framework for organizing data and metadata. This structure enhances data interoperability across computing platforms.\nThese important strategic relationships will provide an environment for collaboration on future Cirata data orchestration platform functionality. Data orchestration represents Cirata's future vision for addressing the challenges of data modernization within the enterprise. In addition,\nCirata is deepening its collaboration with partners and customers a key initiative for Cirata as we continue to evolve the product beyond Hadoop migration, to multiple use cases for large scale data modernization.\nDuring the quarter we also announced the Company's first Live Data Migrator (\"LDM\") implementation under the DMaaS solution offering. This is a contract win with a new telecommunications customer in the\u00a0UAE. This will also be the first project win with Cirata's partner\u00a0Databricks\u00a0to enable Hadoop distributed file system data migration to the cloud. D",

This growth contract represents an expansion of value and scope and a deepening strategic relationship with this customer.\nThe retailer plans to leverage the power of hybrid cloud and deploy Cirata enterprise wide at scale as the standard to make data available for analytics, GenAI and for the innovation of edge use cases.\nThe enterprise-wide licence agreement enables data automation at petabyte scale, allowing for migration from multiple sources to multiple targets (on-premise to and from the cloud).\nFor this innovative customer, Cirata will support the implementation of open table formats (such as Apache Iceberg) to enable platform interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in. Apache Iceberg has emerged as a leading standard for an \"open table format,\" offering a streamlined and scalable framework for organizing data and metadata. This structure enhances data interoperability across computing platforms.\nIn addition, this important strategic relationship will provide an environment for collaboration on future Cirata data orchestration platform functionality.\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer, commented;\n\"This\nenterprise-wide licence agreement with\none of the world's leading retailers\nis a\nstrong endorsement of Cirata's strategy. The ability to leverage the open table format to avoid vendor lock-in was a critical factor for the selection of Cirata. This customer is an innovator in data modernization, and the contract recognizes Cirata as a strategic partner, driven by their strong alignment with our technology roadmap. Cirata provides a clear vision for data orchestration within the enterprise.\nAs we signalled in January, FY25 represents a growth year built on solid foundations and this customer contract marks another step in the right direction. The validation from a leading UK retailer is a strong endorsement that customers are seeking petabyte-scale data automation with the freedom from vendor lock-in.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

The release of the Company's FY24 Annual report will be announced in due course.\nFinancial Headlines\n\u25cf\nBookings for the year: $7.1m (FY23: $7.2m)\n\u25cf\nRevenue for the year: $7.7m (FY23: $6.7m)\n\u25cf\nCash overheads: $20.6m (FY23: $30.3m)\n\u25cf\nAdjusted EBITDA : loss of $13.5m (FY23: loss of $24.2m)\n\u25cf\nLoss from operations: $13.5m (FY23: $36.5m)\n\u25cf\nCash at 31 December 2024: $9.7m (FY23: $18.2m)\nBookings\nFor FY24 overall, the Company delivered total bookings of $7.1m (FY23 $7.2m), broadly flat on the prior year but with improving quality and a mix shift to Data Integration (\"DI\"), which management expects to lead to growth in future bookings. DI bookings grew by 80% to $4.7m, with the trend towards DI (Cirata's core growth driver) in line with the Company's trading update on 9 January 2025. DI accounted for 67% of bookings and DevOps software accounted for 33% (FY23: DI 36% and DevOps 64%).\nMajor wins in the period included a $2.0m Live Data Migrator (LDM) contract with a top 3 US bank for a one-year term. This deal represents the largest Original Equipment Manufacturer (\"OEM\") Big Replicate implementation to date.\nFY24 saw improved engagement with both customers and partners. Changes implemented in the Company's go-to-market (\"GTM\") strategy, including establishing dedicated teams for DI and DevOps, have begun to bear fruit. Improving momentum was observed in the pipeline, supported by partnerships with IBM, Databricks and Oracle. Notable achievements in Q4 included 13 new contract signings, with 6 focused on DI.\nCurrent Trading\nWe expect the momentum in DI to continue in FY25, with Q1 broadly in line with management expectations. The Company will be releasing a Q1 trading update in mid-April.\nFY25 Outlook\nManagement expects improvements in the levels of sales activity and execution, both directly and through its partners, as well as via improved visibility and predictability. For example, elements of the GTM 'Land & Expand' strategy continue to yield growth from existing customers. Management, however, expects the acquisition of new customers to be an improving source of future growth as we move through FY25.\nManagement's aspiration to achieve cash flow breakeven remains unchanged, supported by ongoing improvements in pipeline conversion and operational discipline.\nAt this very early stage in the financial year, management's plans for FY25 are:\n\u00b7\nContinued improvement in the quality of business mix and revenues towards DI\n\u00b7\nContinued high growth in DI following the FY24 trajectory\n\u00b7\nGreater stability in renewals and DevOps\n\u00b7\nFurther expense savings to provide an annualized expense run-rate of\u00a0$16-17m\u00a0from the end of\u00a0Q1 FY25. The sustainable cost base will be approximately one-third of the peak expense levels of early FY23\n\u00b7\nBookings to continue to be back-end weighted with a similar quarterly profile to FY24\nAs previously stated in the Company's Q4 FY24 trading update, management does not anticipate an FY25 fundraise for working capital given its assessment of the current pipeline, the strategic actions to improve predictability and the significantly reduced cost base.\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"2024 was a transitional year for Cirata as we moved from 'rescue' to 'recovery', stabilizing the business to prepare for growth. We have reduced our cost base by roughly two-thirds since the peak in early FY23. Our efforts in restructuring the organisation, strengthening governance and enhancing cultural accountability have delivered tangible results, including the largest LDM Original Equipment Manufacturer implementation in our history with our partner IBM.\nThe release of LDM 3.0 and our reinvigorated partnerships with IBM, Microsoft, Databricks and Oracle position us well to leverage the growing demand for seamless data integration and AI-driven analytics.\nWhile challenges remain and stronger execution is required, the focus for FY25 is clearly on growth and a pivotal year for establishing Cirata as a consistent growth company. The foundations we have put in place and the progress we have made, affirm Cirata's potential as a leader in enterprise data solutions.\nThis announcement contains inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

DI bookings in Q4FY24 were $2.2m, up 51% compared to Q4FY23. This is the strongest bookings quarter for DI since Q4FY20. DI accounted for 77% of bookings and DevOps software accounted for 23% of bookings (Q4FY23 DI 57%: DevOps 43%). In total, 13 contracts were signed in the quarter of which 6 were DI (Q4FY23: in total, 15 contracts signed of which 4 were DI). DI bookings in International were disappointing as was DevOps new business. The overall DevOps decline was 47% from $4.6m in FY23 to $2.4m in FY24. The DevOps decline is primarily due to challenging prior year renewals comparisons when multi-year bookings had been reported.\nFor FY24 overall, the Company delivered total bookings of $7.1m (FY23 $7.2m) representing broadly flat growth YoY but with a mix shift to DI.\nDI bookings were $4.7m growing of 81% YoY. DI accounted for 66% of bookings and DevOps software accounted for 34% (FY23: DI 36% and DevOps 64%).\n[1]\nhttps://cirata.com/news/article/cirata-releases-data-migrator-30\nThis was the strongest year for DI bookings since FY20 and\nunderpinned management's belief in its potential to scale with the focus on Data Integration. From a strongly negative trend (-87% YoY) in Q1FY23, DI bookings registered a positive 180% YoY growth in Q3FY24, followed by 53% YoY growth in Q4FY24. In addition, contract activity went from 2 contracts signed in Q1FY23 to 8 in Q3FY24 and 6 contracts in Q4FY24: demonstrating a stronger 2H performance.\nThe DI growth metrics supported by operating overheads that have been reduced by over 50% from its peak give us cause for optimism in our strategy and demonstrate the potential operating leverage in the business.\nThe cadence of contract activity is improving and there is evidence that our \"land & expand \"strategy is gaining traction. However, management is working to address the issues related to bookings slippage which impacted closure expectations throughout FY24 and highlighted in our mid quarter update announ",

Key features of the LDM offering include live data movement at scale and without data loss, interoperability across multiple data platforms, and the avoidance of vendor lock-in. Cirata's future road map is closely aligned with this top 3 US bank as it represents the leading edge of data transformation within the enterprise.\nThe LDM contract also represents the first transaction completed under the terms of the new OEM agreement to integrate Cirata's LDM technology inside IBM's Big Replicate solution, previously announced on 2 October 2024. This will be the largest value contract for LDM since the restructuring of the Company in March FY23, the largest LDM\ncontract to date in financial services and the largest implementation through the IBM Big Replicate platform.\nCirata's LDM technology allows Big Replicate customers to use a multi-cloud solution, leveraging the benefits of Watsonx.data (Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\")).\nFY24 Bookings Guidance\nIn parallel with the announcement of the LDM contract, Cirata withdraws its FY24 bookings guidance. This is partly due to certain major customers opting for one-year terms rather than multi-year terms and some movement of pipeline opportunities and bookings expectations from Q4FY24 to H1FY25, which has caused a sufficiently wide variation to expected outcomes for bookings in FY24.\nCash overheads run rate is currently c.$5m for Q4, slightly better than expectations. Cash burn for Q4 will be dependent on the closing bookings and cash collection for the quarter once complete. It is anticipated that Q4FY24 cash burn will show sequential improvement relative to Q3FY24 (Q3FY24: c. $3.2m).\nManagement will update the market on the outcome for Q4FY24 in its regular quarterly trading update, expected in mid-January 2025. Also, supporting communication about this announcement\nand the progress of the business to date will be made available in the investor relation section of Cirata's website (\nhttps://cirata.com/investors/reports-and-presentations\n) in due course.\nStephen Kelly, CEO of Cirata commented:\n\"Cirata has set itself the challenge of delivering its LDM product to meet the needs of the most demanding enterprise technology environments. The announcement of the LDM contract through IBM Big Replicate proves Cirata is well positioned to meet those needs. We look forward to shaping a long-term relationship with this top 3 US bank as they build out their data architecture in response to the rapidly changing AI and Machine Learning landscape.\nThe recent renewal of our OEM agreement with IBM set the stage for the closure of this LDM contract, and so the win itself is doubly important. It is not only the largest transaction in the Company's history for LDM within financial services, it is also the largest implementation of LDM for Big Replicate through our highly valued partner IBM.\nWhile today's announcement is a clear signal of our technology's capabilities and our own ability to build commercial trust, it is also a reminder that large contracts can make our business lumpy and that forecasting has indeed proved challenging. In parallel with the announcement of this new contract, Cirata withdraws its FY24 bookings guidance. This is mainly due to the LDM contract and one other contract being of a one-year rather than a multi-year term and the movement of pipeline opportunities and bookings expectations from Q4 FY24 to H1 FY25, which has caused a sufficiently wide variation to expected outcomes for bookings. Our focus continues to be on the long-term pot",

A recorded video interview with Stephen Kelly, CEO of Cirata, where he discusses Q3 FY24 and progress of the business to date can be found\nhere\n.\nSummary\n\u00b7\nBookings for Q3 2024 of $1.7m were in line with Q2 2024 and Q3 FY2023\n\u00b7\nGuidance retained for FY24 bookings at $13-$15m, YTD $4.1m\n\u00b7\n$983,010 renewal of Data Integration (\"DI\") disaster recovery use case for a global insurer\n\u00b7\n16 contracts signed, of which 8 contracts relate to Data Integration\n\u00b7\nRetirement of unutilized prepaids of $1.7m that will help pipeline development, GTM activities and conversion\n\u00b7\nRelease of Live Data Migrator ('LDM') 2.6 with initial support for Apache Iceberg\n\u00b7\nOn track to achieve $20m annualised cost run rate as we exit FY24\n\u00b7\nCash position of $12.9m as at 30 September 2024\n\u00b7\nPost quarter end; strengthened board, with the appointment of two Non-Executive Directors\nTrading Update\nBookings in Q3 2024 were $1.7m (Q3 2023: $1.7m), with the business mix driven by DI growth, accounting for 82% of bookings and DevOps software accounting for 18% of bookings.\nIn total, 16 new contracts were signed in the quarter of which 8 were DI (Q3 2023: 4 DI).\nRenewals secured in the quarter for DI included the Health Care Service Corporation ('HCSC') for a value of $983,000, implementing DI for disaster recovery.\nEstablishing greater sales cycle predictability remains a key priority for management to enable Cirata to enhance growth potential. The cadence of contract activity is improving as evidenced by the uplift in the number of smaller new and growth contracts. Moreover, the sales team is more established which provides greater confidence in sales cycle management and deal closure predictability.\nOutlook\nWith the current pipeline, prospects in progress (including those delayed from Q2 2024) and three months of the year remaining, the Board is retaining its FY24 bookings guidance of $13-15m as, with strong and improved execution, it remains achievable although demanding. We believe we will continue to see improving levels of sales activity, both direct and through partners, as we trade through Q4 2024, and our Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy continues to mature.\nThe Board continues to believe that the current levels of lead generation and early-stage pipeline support the medium-term ambitions of the Company.\nBusiness Review\nAs we stated in our turnaround plan, meaningful commercial partner engagement is a prerequisite for the Company to build sustainable growth. The new management team has worked hard over the last several quarters to rebuild trust with our partners.\nWe have made strides in this regard, and post-period end were pleased to announce the amendment of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (\"OEM\") sales agreement with IBM.\nThe revised agreement signifies the commitment by both organizations to this partnership and as part of this commitment the remaining $1.7m of the prepay has been retired early. This means future bookings will no longer be drawn down against this prepaid balance, ensuring a fresh commercial alignment between both parties that will help pipeline development, GTM activities and conversion. The agreement auto-renews on a 12-monthly basis subject to both parties' agreement.\nThis announcement represents a strategic extension to the existing OEM agreement to integrate Cirata's\nLive\nData Migration\n('LDM') technology inside IBM's Big Replicate solution.\nCirata also announced on 1 October 2024 that\nAmanda Jobbins\u00a0and\u00a0Eric Collins\u00a0have been appointed to the Board as Non\n\u2010\nExecutive Directors with immediate effect. Amanda currently Chief Marketing Officer at Vodafone Business and Eric, Co-Founder of Venture of Impact X Venture partners will bring a wealth of experience to the Board.\nProduct\nThe cadence of engineering output continues to improve with important releases in our DevOps product suite, Subversion Multisite Plus, which signals Cirata's commitment to supporting the Subversion community, an important niche for the Company.\nLDM 2.6 was made generally available in August marginally ahead of plan, adding product capabilities in four key areas: improved security features, role-based access control for more of the product APIs, improved usability and functionality with Databricks, and initial support for Apache Iceberg\n[1]\nwith IBM watsonx.data targets. The improvements in this release are in direct response to customer requirements and alignment to partner technology roadmaps.\nThe new GTM organization is bedding down and leads from partners and customer activity levels are increasing and contributing to pipeline growth. The pipeline is higher quality, better qualified and more robust compared to this point last year or indeed 6 months ago.\nStephen Kelly, Chief Executive Office",

A supporting pre-recorded video presentation with Q&A will be available shortly after the release of this RNS at\nCirata Interims\nor can be accessed through the company website at\nInvestor relations\n.\nFinancial Headlines\n\u00b7\nRevenue for the Period $3.4m (H1 FY23: $3.0m)\n\u00b7\nBookings\n[1]\nof $2.4m (H1 FY23: $2.8m)\n\u00b7\nCash overheads\n[2]\nof $11.8m (H1 FY23: $17.6m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n[3]\nloss of $8.6m (H1 FY23: $14.8m, loss)\n\u00b7\nStatutory loss from operations of $9.6m (H1 FY23: $18.8m, loss)\n\u00b7\nCash at 30 June 2024 of $9.1m (31 December 2023: $18.2m)\n\u00b7\nOutlook:\nThe Board is retaining its FY24 booking guidance of $13-15m as, with strong execution, it remains achievable although demanding with expected bookings Q4 FY24 weighted\nBookings\nBookings in H1 FY24 were $2.4m (H1 FY23: $2.8m), with the business mix driven by DevOps software, accounting for 59% of bookings and Data Integration (\"DI\") software accounting for 41% of bookings (H1 FY23: DevOps software 81%, DI 19%). New and growth contracts represented 43% of the mix by value (H1 FY23: 15% of the mix). The improvement in mix to new and growth contracts represents a YoY improvement in the new contract acquisition and expansion of existing contracts.\nIn total, 31 contracts were signed in H1 FY24 (H1 FY23: 33 contracts) of which 16 were new and growth contracts (H1 FY23:13 contracts). DI new and growth contracts for the Period totalled 7, including the second phase to the previously announced deal with a large automotive manufacturer, (H1 FY23: 4 contracts). DI represented 85% of the value of all new and growth contracts.\nSignificant renewals secured in H1 FY24 included the previously announced $592,000 3-year maintenance and support renewal by Oppo for Cirata's MultiSite Gerrit product\n[4]\n.\nDeal slippage remained a feature of H1 FY24 performance. As disclosed in the Q2 FY24 trading update, published on 16 July 2024, some of the significant potential deals in Q2 FY24 slipped. We continue to expect that these will conclude in the latter part of H2 FY24 matching customer critical timelines. During H1 FY24 the team delivered some improvement on closing smaller deals, which is encouraging, but challenges remain around the complex nature of larger enterprise sales for DI, with complexity from customer and partner procurement processes. Establishing greater sales cycle predictability with better sales execution, therefore, remains a key priority for Management to enable Cirata to move beyond its current non-linear growth trajectory. Today, the sales team is more established which provides greater confidence in sales cycle management and deal closure predictability.\nKey Performance Indicators (\"KPIs\")\nBookings have lagged the overall improvement in the business since the implementation of the Turnaround plan prompted by the March 2023 disclosures. However, KPIs point to the ongoing recovery taking place in the business.\n1. Exiting H1 bookings pipeline at all stages amounted to greater than 110 opportunities.\n2. Within the pipeline the product mix is 31% DevOps, 69% DI. The geographic mix is 34% International, 66% North America.\n3. 70% of lead generation has come through partners.\n4. Within DI, we have won 6 new logos including 2 major Automotive companies, and 4 global financial institutions. Returning customers in DI include a global retailer, global IT services company, Telecoms company, global automotive company, and a global insurer,\n5. Within DI we have implemented all three target use cases (migration, disaster recovery, and continuous use case) using the Live Data Migrator (\"LDM\") product. These have been contracted to both returning and new customers.\n6. Returning customers are an important metric for the business, not only from a booking's perspective but also an indication of trust in both the product and the Cirata brand. In total since the rescue of the business in March 23 we have 47 renewals, 6 of which have been for DI. In addition, New and Growth contracts totaled 33, of which DI totaled 15.\n7. In DevOps Cirata launched the first product release since 2021 to support Geritt 3.7. Work is underway to support 3.9. Customer feedback is positive including Proof of Concepts (\"POC\").\n8. The scope of the LDM target integrations include, Hadoop Distributed file system (HDFS), Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake storage (ADLS) Gen 2, Google Cloud\nStorage, IBM Object Storage, Oracle Object Storage and, Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service.\n9. For DI, the recent release of LDM 2.5 continues to improve the scope of both source and target implementations, aligning with our partners and customers immediate needs and further expanding the opportunities for lead gener",

I'm Conchita \ud83d\ude09 Second, you all realize, that the major part of the Q4 renewals/extensions runs for three years? Meaning there won't be any renewals until three years from now. Knowing Cirata's creative wording I assume that they also included the maintenance for the duration of the contract in the 9.8 m (6.7+3.1). I haven't seen the payment terms, but I don't think, there will be a huge upfront payment. If you look at the revenue per year, it's not that impressive. Symphony will probably be more a subscription solution, so it' all about MRR/ARR, split that amount over a year and it's just petty cash. We need net new customers. Basically it's the same scheme, we've seen before. We all can look up what SK has promised over the last two years. Real transparency would really help.",

I might be wrong, my understanding is, that Symphony is more of a self service, hence they don't need DevOps anymore (and the sell brought in some cash too). To be fair, I didn't expect much revenue from Symphony engagements in Q4, new product, smaller deal sizes due to the nature of the product  and so on. I wonder why they haven't realized a full feature demo video, PSM is brilliant when it comes to that. Maybe SK will enlighten us. DI is still their product, but it will be much harder. to sell without DevOps and I don't know if it was a wise decision to let a excellent partner manager go. Time will tell.",

It's a good thing that existing customers still rely on Cirata! Looking back I think it tool him too long to grt rid of the former sales management (excluding Partner manager), having 3 CROs never made any sense, but there might have been some personal ties, eho knows. Symphony: SK said they have been developing this in close conjunction with customers, yet they are still defining use cases? Makes no sense in my world. My first thought back then was (you might remember): They identified a need, built a solution for it and already have a customer who is willing to buy. I was wrong about that. Now SK is talking about lead gen and potential POVs, meaning so far there had been nothing. Symphony could really be huge, but it's not the only data orchestration platform out there. From what is available right now, it's not unique when it comes to features. I hope this isn't the same level of overconfidence we had before.",

He has now , finally after messing about in the rigging, created a much reduced revenue company ready to take on new business if and only if new potential customers think that Cirata will be in business in 6 months time. That means balance sheet and unless Dom brings the bacon home in spades much earlier then Cirata will have to fundraise at a lower share price. But the major holders dominate so there will be investment at a share price that has no bearing upon reality. Keep your feet on the ground.",

Since SK joined, they haven't managed to sign any significant deal with a net new customer. Just renewals and extensions, disguised as new deals. SK more or less confirmed that in the last video. Symphony might be huge, but there are a lot of other established players in the market. What I find concerning is that even three month after product launch, they haven't signed a single customer. According to SK they are still defining use cases (WTF?) and work on lead generation and getting POCs. I don't know much about the stock market,  but I do have a pretty good industry knowledge. Check my posting history, I was quite accurate over the last two years. If you look at the numbers without knowing the background, it might look promising, but renewals alone won't keep Cirata afloat. I think a lot people see through that, that is why the SP isn't exactly soaring right now. Cirata is more storytelling than real business. I'd be very cautious, but again that should be the default for all investment. I might be wrong and you might be missing out on a once in lifetime opportunity.",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

On one hand I do think the new management team led by SK are streets ahead and frankly are on a different level to their predecessors. On the other hand, I am very disappointed by the Q2 and Q3 performances in 2025. But then again, so is SK. This share is very unusual. When it previously was Wandisco, it was a former stock market darling and the shares went over \u00a313 each before it crashed. There are very few companies that go from \u00a313+ a share to 20p and are still trading. But here we have that rare example of a potentially phoenix like recovery possibly happening. I have tried to be unbiased in my postings. Obviously as a shareholder, I am biased, but I do feel some of the RNSs in 2025 were more opaque than necessary. That must be the case otherwise we would not be debating their meaning continually. More to the point, as I stated even yesterday: is it or is it not a growth stock or just a renewals stock? None of us can work it out. I'm personally holding here because I do believe it is morphing into a growth stock, it just seems to be taking longer than we all anticipated. Clearly the oncoming Q4 results will be critical to our understand of things on here. There seems to be no point, in my view in continually knocking the company. What happened in the past as Wandisco, is in the past - even the FCA agree with that. It is not current management's fault that so many shareholders lost so much money when those Wandisco shares collapsed / were suspended. We are where we are. It has been difficult remaining optimistic over 2025 but I was overjoyed when CityAM tipped the stock. It does look to me like things could be about to change: the cost base ex DevOps is now much lower, and the company are securing decent contracts. My guess is that this year they are going to move back into the black. As and when that arises, the shares should go much higher - there's only a small free float after all. There's no point owning shares in a company and moaning about them non stop. What irritates me here is the self entitlement of some who have never owned shares in the company but who can't stop commenting negatively about it. I feel sorry for those who lost a lot of money when it collapsed previously, but as everyone knows, you average down and lower your average loss. I accept there are some out there who cannot bear to invest a further penny here, but I do think if \u00a313+ overvalued the shares, then 20p undervalues them. It's all to play for in my view and it looks like CityAm agree with me.",

Every RNS trying to sell a renewal as a new deal. Every promise that wasn't kept. All these strange management decision, the 3 CRO mysterium, the 3xpensive board, the brain drain and trying to sell Ascari as the new savior. SK has cut costs, sold Dev ops, but failed to bring in any net new deals or customers. For me the it's not a lack of transparency, it's actively misleading investors. Some of left Wandisco (the former Head of Legal), they don't even list Cirata on thie4 Linkedin profile anymore. That speaks volumes. A BBC interview and a guy an CityAM doesn't change that. Again, where are all thise millions they promised us in 2024. Symphony doesn't seem to fly, or given the nature of the product, deals are too small to make an impact.",

Q1 2026 is already showing signs that this growth is continuing at a strong pace and expectations are that 2026 will easily surpass 2025 as there are now expected to be a number of material deals closing in Q1 and Q2 2026. Also seeing a pick up in sales from the key US market. Post the sale of Dev-ops, headcount is now down to 54 staff, and cost base down to $9m. Accordingly, the company now feels it is able to self fund its development going forward, and there is no need for any further working capital in 2026. \" We can perhaps all dream, but I do think Q4 2025 turnover is going to be excellent. Equally, I do think headcount must have dropped following Dev-ops being sold. So the cost base must now be materially lower meaning it is that much easier to break even and self sustain the business going forward, especially if, as is expected, SK confirms that a number of growth metrics are now being met. I'm just a shareholder here, I have no other connections to CRTA, and have never worked for them or for Wandisco. But I do think the wind is changing and if even some of the above 'wishlist' come true, there could be a very substantial rise in the share price. Why did CityAm recently tip this stock as one of its top small company tips for 2026? We will soon find out......",

Numbers/Sales: You do know, that renewals are usually not handled by the sales team, left alone the CRO and CEO. Renewals are a must have and everything else would be a disappointment. Just because they changed the product name and added some new features doesn't make it a new deal. Show me what Sales has achieved in the last two years, not much I reckon. It's my industry knowledge telling me, that we haven't turned around yet. The market doesn't seem to buy it either, hence the SP hasn't soared.",

I'm Conchita \ud83d\ude09 Second, you all realize, that the major part of the Q4 renewals/extensions runs for three years? Meaning there won't be any renewals until three years from now. Knowing Cirata's creative wording I assume that they also included the maintenance for the duration of the contract in the 9.8 m (6.7+3.1). I haven't seen the payment terms, but I don't think, there will be a huge upfront payment. If you look at the revenue per year, it's not that impressive. Symphony will probably be more a subscription solution, so it' all about MRR/ARR, split that amount over a year and it's just petty cash. We need net new customers. Basically it's the same scheme, we've seen before. We all can look up what SK has promised over the last two years. Real transparency would really help.",

To be fair, I didn't expect much revenue from Symphony engagements in Q4, new product, smaller deal sizes due to the nature of the product  and so on. I wonder why they haven't realized a full feature demo video, PSM is brilliant when it comes to that. Maybe SK will enlighten us. DI is still their product, but it will be much harder. to sell without DevOps and I don't know if it was a wise decision to let a excellent partner manager go. Time will tell.",

Looking back I think it tool him too long to grt rid of the former sales management (excluding Partner manager), having 3 CROs never made any sense, but there might have been some personal ties, eho knows. Symphony: SK said they have been developing this in close conjunction with customers, yet they are still defining use cases? Makes no sense in my world. My first thought back then was (you might remember): They identified a need, built a solution for it and already have a customer who is willing to buy. I was wrong about that. Now SK is talking about lead gen and potential POVs, meaning so far there had been nothing. Symphony could really be huge, but it's not the only data orchestration platform out there. From what is available right now, it's not unique when it comes to features. I hope this isn't the same level of overconfidence we had before.",

Since SK joined, they haven't managed to sign any significant deal with a net new customer. Just renewals and extensions, disguised as new deals. SK more or less confirmed that in the last video. Symphony might be huge, but there are a lot of other established players in the market. What I find concerning is that even three month after product launch, they haven't signed a single customer. According to SK they are still defining use cases (WTF?) and work on lead generation and getting POCs. I don't know much about the stock market,  but I do have a pretty good industry knowledge. Check my posting history, I was quite accurate over the last two years. If you look at the numbers without knowing the background, it might look promising, but renewals alone won't keep Cirata afloat. I think a lot people see through that, that is why the SP isn't exactly soaring right now. Cirata is more storytelling than real business. I'd be very cautious, but again that should be the default for all investment. I might be wrong and you might be missing out on a once in lifetime opportunity.",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

          "content": "Before anyone comments on the $7m - 8m costs figure, I'd urge you to look at last years RNSs. Yes, they did comment on the annual costs being expected to drop to $12m - 13m level ahead of the DevOps sale. But after that sale, they reported that costs were on line to drop to $12m - 13m by end of 2025; before presumably any staff had been shed or moved to BlueOptima. It looks to me like around 1/3 to 1/4 of the staff were involved with the DevOps side of things, if, as a simple calculation, they are all deducted from the headcount going into the fourth quarter, then there must be a further reduction in fixed costs. $7m - 8m allows for a 1/4 reduction. My point is that the headcount must have materially dropped after the sale, figures for Q3 include an unchanged headcount from Q2 so clearly the DevOps sale has not been taken into account. Presumably where employment contracts are involved, there's a tail to staff leaving, and also a confidentiality issue and a human perspective - these are real people with real jobs, so no-one wants to labour the point that the company has benefitted from reducing staff costs so much. Nevertheless, it must be the case that as costs continue to drop, if turnover continues to rise, and Q4 should be excellent, then at some stage, turnover must exceed costs. I think this has now been achieved for 2025 as a whole following a strong Q4. It will be important to see how SK describes Q1 2026 as already starting - is this increased flow of business continuing into 2026? Q1 2025 was very strong after all - can this be repeated or is it likely to be repeated in 2026?",

From what I can see, DevOps contributed increasingly little to overall trading as 2025 progressed. Detracting it from overall figures both on a headcount, turnover, cash flow, and profitability basis should become apparent in Q4 where we should for the first time get a fairer view of the Company's trading ex DevOps. My point earlier was to point out that there is a tail to selling part of the company - for example: different staff will have different notice periods. Therefore until all the staff involved with DevOps have actually migrated to BlueOptima or left employment with CRTA, we will not know the true difference made. It should start to become apparent in Q4 2025, but if staff have at least a three month notice period, then they will remain employed under their CRTA contracts until that ends - i.e. until well into or beyond Q4. We have no visibility on this currently so Q4 should make for especially interesting reading. No wonder CityAm was tipping it - you have to wonder what their information set was before issuing the tip?",

Neither thing can surely be judged to be negative items for us shareholders? Also, the analyst there is highly respected, so the recommendation presumably carries weight. However, it does seem more than a little odd though that there seems to be a lack of new deals being declared especially when the company touts itself as being a growth company and sells the DevOps section because that was just dealing with low growth renewal business. Equally, it seems odd to be announcing periodically new tie-ups / DMaas projects / etc but not having any follow up RNSs to educate us how much business has since come in connected to those RNSs. Obviously, we all want to see the company transformed into a high growth company but in turn, the company needs to prove that contract wins are exactly that rather than simply renewals. It is noticeable that despite our discussion on here where many have challenged the status of the October and November RNS wins, no-one at the company has responded or commented on such speculation. The Q4 RNS needs to address such speculation as well as the points made in the post by Icarus below, even though none of us want to see a destructively dilutive rights issue taking place. I am especially intrigued to know what the fixed costs have fallen to ex the DevOps section being sold. I cannot believe it is $12m-13m as that was the figure for the entire group of 71 employees.",

I don\u2019t think he  believed they would turnover 40 million and pay dividends this year. What I think he is doing is trying to drum up interest in  the stock, trying to get people to invest their money so the price will rise so he can get some of his money back.

On one hand I do think the new management team led by SK are streets ahead and frankly are on a different level to their predecessors. On the other hand, I am very disappointed by the Q2 and Q3 performances in 2025. But then again, so is SK. This share is very unusual. When it previously was Wandisco, it was a former stock market darling and the shares went over \u00a313 each before it crashed. There are very few companies that go from \u00a313+ a share to 20p and are still trading. But here we have that rare example of a potentially phoenix like recovery possibly happening. I have tried to be unbiased in my postings. Obviously as a shareholder, I am biased, but I do feel some of the RNSs in 2025 were more opaque than necessary. That must be the case otherwise we would not be debating their meaning continually. More to the point, as I stated even yesterday: is it or is it not a growth stock or just a renewals stock? None of us can work it out. I'm personally holding here because I do believe it is morphing into a growth stock, it just seems to be taking longer than we all anticipated. Clearly the oncoming Q4 results will be critical to our understand of things on here. There seems to be no point, in my view in continually knocking the company. What happened in the past as Wandisco, is in the past - even the FCA agree with that. It is not current management's fault that so many shareholders lost so much money when those Wandisco shares collapsed / were suspended. We are where we are. It has been difficult remaining optimistic over 2025 but I was overjoyed when CityAM tipped the stock. It does look to me like things could be about to change: the cost base ex DevOps is now much lower, and the company are securing decent contracts. My guess is that this year they are going to move back into the black. As and when that arises, the shares should go much higher - there's only a small free float after all. There's no point owning shares in a company and moaning about them non stop. What irritates me here is the self entitlement of some who have never owned shares in the company but who can't stop commenting negatively about it. I feel sorry for those who lost a lot of money when it collapsed previously, but as everyone knows, you average down and lower your average loss. I accept there are some out there who cannot bear to invest a further penny here, but I do think if \u00a313+ overvalued the shares, then 20p undervalues them. It's all to play for in my view and it looks like CityAm agree with me.",

SK has cut costs, sold Dev ops, but failed to bring in any net new deals or customers. For me the it's not a lack of transparency, it's actively misleading investors. Some of left Wandisco (the former Head of Legal), they don't even list Cirata on thie4 Linkedin profile anymore. That speaks volumes. A BBC interview and a guy an CityAM doesn't change that. Again, where are all thise millions they promised us in 2024. Symphony doesn't seem to fly, or given the nature of the product, deals are too small to make an impact.",

Also seeing a pick up in sales from the key US market. Post the sale of Dev-ops, headcount is now down to 54 staff, and cost base down to $9m. Accordingly, the company now feels it is able to self fund its development going forward, and there is no need for any further working capital in 2026. \" We can perhaps all dream, but I do think Q4 2025 turnover is going to be excellent. Equally, I do think headcount must have dropped following Dev-ops being sold. So the cost base must now be materially lower meaning it is that much easier to break even and self sustain the business going forward, especially if, as is expected, SK confirms that a number of growth metrics are now being met. I'm just a shareholder here, I have no other connections to CRTA, and have never worked for them or for Wandisco. But I do think the wind is changing and if even some of the above 'wishlist' come true, there could be a very substantial rise in the share price. Why did CityAm recently tip this stock as one of its top small company tips for 2026? We will soon find out......",

If the stake in particular was to value the company at a more decent level, this would heavily boost the shares. Still you are more than right about one thing: PLEASE: NO MORE DEAL SLIPPAGE!!!!!",

Numbers/Sales: You do know, that renewals are usually not handled by the sales team, left alone the CRO and CEO. Renewals are a must have and everything else would be a disappointment. Just because they changed the product name and added some new features doesn't make it a new deal. Show me what Sales has achieved in the last two years, not much I reckon. It's my industry knowledge telling me, that we haven't turned around yet. The market doesn't seem to buy it either, hence the SP hasn't soared.",

Now the biggie is that FINALLY, Cirata will be \u201ccash flow positive in Q1 FY26 and planning for cash break-even for FY26 overall\u201d.  Inflection is happening but carry on with your short and you will get hurt.  The stock is also back above its 200 day moving average which technically is a very bullish indicator too.

Therefore, as and when new business rolls in, the figures should improve sharply. That is a remarkable achievement, since the renewals level previously was not enough to sustain the business - now it is. Given SK's confidence that Q1 2026 will be cash flow positive, I'd guess he is aware of some deals about to get the green light that will cause a cash flow positive position to arise. It looks like we are in for some more great news..........soon!",

I'm Conchita \ud83d\ude09 Second, you all realize, that the major part of the Q4 renewals/extensions runs for three years? Meaning there won't be any renewals until three years from now. Knowing Cirata's creative wording I assume that they also included the maintenance for the duration of the contract in the 9.8 m (6.7+3.1). I haven't seen the payment terms, but I don't think, there will be a huge upfront payment. If you look at the revenue per year, it's not that impressive. Symphony will probably be more a subscription solution, so it' all about MRR/ARR, split that amount over a year and it's just petty cash. We need net new customers. Basically it's the same scheme, we've seen before. We all can look up what SK has promised over the last two years. Real transparency would really help.",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

Clearly the jury is out here, awaiting proof that it is not all just hot air. Given SK's comments that he expected Q1 2026 to be cash flow positive, you'd expect he would pull something out of the bag imminently to demonstrate why he made that assertion but it looks like we will soon be getting to the end of January with no new deals being announced.......",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

Clearly the jury is out here, awaiting proof that it is not all just hot air. Given SK's comments that he expected Q1 2026 to be cash flow positive, you'd expect he would pull something out of the bag imminently to demonstrate why he made that assertion but it looks like we will soon be getting to the end of January with no new deals being announced.......",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

It rather helps then to have such a low share price currently.......or am I just getting a bit cynical?",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

Also, what is going on with Symphony? How is it selling? Are new deals coming through? Now the share price is roughly back to where it was before the Q4 RNS - what a shame. Clearly the jury is out here, awaiting proof that it is not all just hot air. Given SK's comments that he expected Q1 2026 to be cash flow positive, you'd expect he would pull something out of the bag imminently to demonstrate why he made that assertion but it looks like we will soon be getting to the end of January with no new deals being announced.......",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",

Clearly the jury is out here, awaiting proof that it is not all just hot air. Given SK's comments that he expected Q1 2026 to be cash flow positive, you'd expect he would pull something out of the bag imminently to demonstrate why he made that assertion but it looks like we will soon be getting to the end of January with no new deals being announced.......",

          "content": "Rnorth, the best guidance I can give you is to study the RNS's going back to 2023. The company was previously known then as Wandisco and suffered a large accounting fraud leading to suspension of the shares [they were over \u00a313 at the time] and the complete change of the management in 2023. It has taken some time for both the reputation of the newly emerging company - it changed its name to Cirata back in 2023 - and for the FCA to look into the matter. The FCA investigation is now closed, and judging from how the deals have been starting to get done, the reputation of the Company has also now been successfully repaired. This is all down to the new management team led by Stephen Kelly. The point is, as you will have noticed: the shares are no longer \u00a313+ and there's been an enormous loss of equity as the share price collapsed. Equally, many of the Wandisco staff have lost their jobs, including the old management team. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of posters on here who can say nothing good about the Company. These will be ex-shareholders who lost considerable sums of money when the shares collapsed, OR, ex-staff who left / were forced to leave. You cannot really blame them for taking their frustrations out on here, but it does get a bit tedious when they can never change the record. In my view, you rarely get a situation where a company collapses from \u00a313+ to 24p and is STILL trading. This one is beginning now to emerge phoenix like from the chaos of 2023 and the turn around looks like it is gathering pace. Like others, I expect the share price to be significantly revalued soon as news emerges, and the Q1 2026 position emerges. It's currently at / near the bottom share price wise, hence the interest in it. According to LinkedIn, Stephen Kelly and Dominic Arcari are currently in the US on a 'jammed schedule full of customer, partner, and investor meetings this week.' Hopefully there will be some excellent news coming out of this in due course.",
