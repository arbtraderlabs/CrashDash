We expect to report 2025 revenue of c.\u00a31.74bn (2024: \u00a31.93bn) and EBITDA in the range of \u00a3135-138m for the continuing Group (2024: \u00a3143.1m), in line with market expectations. The continued focus on strong operational execution, together with expanded 'self-help' cost reduction programmes, have enabled us to mitigate the impact of softer end-market demand since global tariff changes were announced at the start of Q2 and deliver resilient earnings and an increased EBITDA margin.\nThe Group delivered positive Free Cash Flow for the year, with a cash inflow in the second half as expected. Year-end net debt is expected to be c.\u00a3575m (H1 2025: \u00a3638.3m, FY 2024: \u00a3597.0m) reflecting rigorous focus on profit and cash management, partially supported by the recently-announced \u00a350m receivables arrangement with our largest shareholder, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad Group. The Group's covenant net debt:EBITDA as at 31 December 2025 was 4.7-4.8x, well within the requirement of less than 5.25x.\nDespite the lower revenue in the year, the Group achieved a further improvement in gross and EBITDA margins, principally reflecting the ongoing strategic re-allocation of capital and other resources towards the higher margin, more resilient speciality solutions in our portfolio and 'self-help' cost reductions (mainly in the Coatings & Construction Solutions (CCS) division and in SG&A functions).\nDivisionally, Adhesive Solutions (AS) continued to regain share and enhance margins, supported by our product capacity investment in Texas. End-market demand across the CCS division was varied throughout the second half, with a slightly improved trend in Q4 in coatings offset by a slightly weaker period for construction and consumer sub-segments, while weak demand for energy solutions continued, reflecting low levels of oil and gas drilling activity. Health & Protection volumes for the medical glove market from both new and existing customers began to improve in Q4, although margins in this business remain substantially below pre-pandemic levels.\nAlongside robust operational execution, we remain focused on the Group's strategic transformation. Having divested William Blythe in May 2025, we continue to progress the Group's broadened divestment pipeline in order to support deleveraging and simplify the portfolio further.\nAs we look to 2026, we expect to make year-on year progress driven by self-help actions, even without a significant market recovery. Specifically, we anticipate that the full year contributions from our cost programmes and product investments made in AS during 2025, ongoing margin progress in our speciality businesses and Health & Protection volume improvement will be partially offset by wage inflation and normalisation of bonus accrual in the year.\nCommenting, Synthomer CEO Michael Willome said:\n\"We are pleased with the positive cash, robust earnings and margin performance Synthomer has delivered in 2025 given the persistently adverse market backdrop for the sector. The whole organisation has rigorously prioritised what is within our control - expanding cost savings, accelerating the portfolio transformation towards speciality solutions and closely managing resources to safeguard our financial position in response to the ongoing geopolitical and tariff-related turbulence which has unbalanced demand and supply in our end markets. The protracted downturn has accentuated the importance of our strategy: to focus on improving our operating leverage in those areas of our portfolio with strong market positions in fundamentally attractive speciality end markets. As such, while the near-term environment remains challenging, we remain committed to our ambition to double Synthomer's recent earnings levels in the medium term, through self-help, end-market volume recovery and strategic delivery.\"\nFurther information:\nInvestors: Faisal Tabbah, Vice President Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0) 1279 775 306\nMedia: Nick Hasell, FTI Consulting\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1340\nNotes\nAll financial information provided in this release is as defined in the Group's 2024 Annual Report and is preliminary and unaudited.

The Company has put this temporary arrangement in place with the support of KLK to provide additional short-term financial flexibility and ensure a prudent level of banking covenant headroom at year end.\nUnder the arrangement, the Company and KLK have agreed that KLK will purchase c.\u00a350m of Company trade receivables due on or before 28 February 2026, which are not eligible for inclusion in the Company's existing committed \u20ac200m non-recourse receivables financing facility. It is anticipated that receivables purchased under the arrangement and in the existing committed receivables financing facility together will not exceed \u20ac200m (c.\u00a3175m). The purchasing arrangement terms have been agreed on an arms-length basis and are consistent with terms available from third party market participants for an arrangement of this nature.\nRelated party transaction\nBy virtue of KLK and its connected parties' c.27 per cent shareholding in Synthomer, KLK is considered a related party of Synthomer under the UK Listing Rules.\u00a0The board of Synthomer (excluding Dato' Lee Hau Hian and Uwe Halder by reason of their relationship with KLK) considers that the purchasing arrangement is fair and reasonable as far as Synthomer shareholders are concerned, and have been so advised by Rothschild & Co acting in its capacity as sponsor in relation to this related party transaction.\nPost-close trading update\nSynthomer plans to publish its post-close trading update for the year ending 31 December 2025 in late January.\nFurther information:\nInvestors: Faisal Tabbah, Vice President Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0) 1279 775 306\nMedia: Nick Hasell, FTI Consulting\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1340\nNotes\nSynthomer plc is a leading supplier of high-performance, highly specialised polymers and ingredients that play vital roles in key sectors such as coatings, construction, adhesives, and health and protection - growing markets for customers who serve billions of end users worldwide.
