Results of voting at the AGM will be announced later today.\nTrading in Q1 2024 was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. Continuing Group volumes were at their highest levels since Q2 2022. Whilst this partially reflects some short-term customer restocking - and there is still no evidence of a sustained improvement in underlying end-market demand - we are seeing improving activity levels in some of the segments of the Group that were previously more challenged.\nQ1 2024 Continuing Group EBITDA was higher than the prior year period, benefitting from continued robust pricing particularly in our speciality businesses, ongoing cost reduction activities and lower energy costs. Q1 2024 Continuing Group revenue was lower than the prior year period due to lower raw materials prices.\nWe have made further progress in delivering our speciality solutions strategy, alongside maintaining our focus on generating cash flow and reducing leverage. In April, we successfully tendered for \u20ac370m of our bonds due 2025, reducing gross debt and extending maturities by issuing \u20ac350m of bonds due 2029. Our next significant debt maturity is in 2027. In May, we completed the divestment of the Compounds business, increasing our focus on core end markets and further reducing site complexity. Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our manufacturing footprint by 10 sites to 33, through a combination of non-core divestments and rationalisation activity, with further actions underway.\nAs previously indicated, we expect to make some earnings progress (on a comparable basis adjusting for the divested Compounds business) and be Free Cash Flow positive in 2024, even if macroeconomic demand conditions do not improve.\nCommenting, Synthomer CEO Michael Willome said:\n\"We are cautiously encouraged by trading since the start of the year: while there are signs of improvement in some of our end markets, visibility of a sustained recovery remains elusive at this stage. We therefore continue to strengthen Synthomer's position for the future, by delivering our specialisation strategy, optimising our portfolio and cost position, and demonstrating the cash generative nature of our business.\"\nFurther information:\nInvestors: Faisal Tabbah, Vice President Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0) 1279 775 306\nMedia: Charles Armitstead, Teneo\nTel: +44 (0) 7703 330 269\nNotes\nSynthomer plans to report interim results for the six months to 30 June 2024 on 13 August 2024.\nLegal Entity Identifier (LEI): 213800EHT3TI1KPQQJ56.

The business has approximately 85 employees based at its UK manufacturing site in Accrington, Lancashire. William Blythe is part of Synthomer's Health & Protection and Performance Materials division and was designated as non-core to the Group as part of the strategic review announced in October 2022.\nIn the year ended 31 December 2024, William Blythe generated sales of \u00a354m and stand-alone adjusted EBITDA of \u00a34m. The transaction is conditional on certain customary closing conditions, is expected to complete at the end of May 2025, and the net proceeds will be used to reduce Group net debt.\nCommenting, Synthomer CEO Michael Willome said:\n\"Today's announcement recognises William Blythe's unique attributes and strong performance over many years as part of Synthomer. At the same time, the business has limited synergies with the rest of the Group and its divestment will further reduce the complexity of our site portfolio and enhance our focus on higher value, higher growth speciality chemicals markets where we have strong and sustainable leadership positions. With the divestment to the ambitious management team backed by H2 Equity Partners, I am confident this is a win-win transaction for all involved and wish all our William Blythe colleagues well for the next exciting chapter in its long history.\"\nFurther information:\nInvestors: Faisal Tabbah, Vice President Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0) 1279 775 306\nMedia: Nick Hasell, FTI Consulting\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1340\nNotes\nLegal Entity Identifier (LEI): 213800EHT3TI1KPQQJ56.\nClassification as per DTR 6 Annex 1R: 3.1.\nSynthomer plc is a leading supplier of high-performance, highly specialised polymers and ingredients that play vital roles in key sectors such as coatings, construction, adhesives, and health and protection - growing markets for customers who serve billions of end users worldwide.
