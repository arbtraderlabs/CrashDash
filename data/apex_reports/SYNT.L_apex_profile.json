The Company has put this temporary arrangement in place with the support of KLK to provide additional short-term financial flexibility and ensure a prudent level of banking covenant headroom at year end.\nUnder the arrangement, the Company and KLK have agreed that KLK will purchase c.\u00a350m of Company trade receivables due on or before 28 February 2026, which are not eligible for inclusion in the Company's existing committed \u20ac200m non-recourse receivables financing facility. It is anticipated that receivables purchased under the arrangement and in the existing committed receivables financing facility together will not exceed \u20ac200m (c.\u00a3175m). The purchasing arrangement terms have been agreed on an arms-length basis and are consistent with terms available from third party market participants for an arrangement of this nature.\nRelated party transaction\nBy virtue of KLK and its connected parties' c.27 per cent shareholding in Synthomer, KLK is considered a related party of Synthomer under the UK Listing Rules.\u00a0The board of Synthomer (excluding Dato' Lee Hau Hian and Uwe Halder by reason of their relationship with KLK) considers that the purchasing arrangement is fair and reasonable as far as Synthomer shareholders are concerned, and have been so advised by Rothschild & Co acting in its capacity as sponsor in relation to this related party transaction.\nPost-close trading update\nSynthomer plans to publish its post-close trading update for the year ending 31 December 2025 in late January.\nFurther information:\nInvestors: Faisal Tabbah, Vice President Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0) 1279 775 306\nMedia: Nick Hasell, FTI Consulting\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1340\nNotes\nSynthomer plc is a leading supplier of high-performance, highly specialised polymers and ingredients that play vital roles in key sectors such as coatings, construction, adhesives, and health and protection - growing markets for customers who serve billions of end users worldwide.

The Adhesive Solutions division continued to regain share and enhance margins, supported by our investment in increased APO capacity for adhesive applications at our Texas facility, which came onstream in July. Health & Protection volumes for the medical glove market remained subdued in the period, although our customers are increasingly confident of benefiting from their improved competitiveness in the US medical glove market following tariff changes. End markets in the Coatings & Construction Solutions division were more varied in the period - improving construction and relatively stable consumer sub-segments were offset by a slowdown in coatings demand particularly in the USA and low levels of oil and gas drilling activity affecting the energy solutions business. As anticipated, our 'in region, for region' manufacturing strategy means we are experiencing limited direct tariff impact which we are largely offsetting through surcharges, but we remain mindful that ongoing uncertainties around the global trade environment continue to create volatility in end-market demand.\nAs previously described, the Group has responded to the market environment by identifying additional rationalisation and cost efficiency opportunities. The new programme announced in August, which includes the removal of around 250 roles globally from the organisation, has now largely been completed and is on track to deliver c.\u00a320-25m in savings on an annual run-rate basis by 2026. This programme supplements the previously identified benefits from robust pricing and the efficiency, reliability improvement and other 'self-help' actions implemented in 2025.\nAlongside operational execution, we continue to focus on the strategic transformation of the Group and on strengthening our balance sheet. Having divested William Blythe in May, we continue to progress the Group's broadened divestment pipeline in order to accelerate the Group's deleveraging and simplify the portfolio further. Focus on cash generation is helping to ensure that the Group retains ample committed liquidity (after repayment of the stub 2025 bonds on 2 July 2025).\nWith our additional self-help actions largely mitigating the soft end-market demand conditions that we anticipate will persist for the remainder of 2025, we expect Continuing Group EBITDA for the year to be similar to the \u00a3143m reported in 2024, and expect a cash inflow in H2 to result in broadly neutral Free Cash Flow for the year. As we begin to look to 2026, we anticipate progress in Group earnings and cash generation as a result of full year contributions from our self-help actions and product investments.\nCommenting, Synthomer CEO Michael Willome said:\n\"With ongoing global geopolitical and tariff-related turbulence continuing to unbalance demand and supply in our end markets, we have sharpened our focus on what we can control - expanding our cost saving programme, accelerating the transformation of our business portfolio and allocating resources even more rigorously to strengthen our financial position. We have clear commercial, operational and strategic plans in place, which are contributing to greater resilience and a stronger portfolio mix with considerable operating leverage to end-market demand recovery. As such, we remain confident in our objective to double Synthomer's recent earnings levels in the medium term, through our cost actions and strategy of focusing the business on market-leading speciality products with sustainable, differentiated benefits for global end-users.\"\nFurther information:\nInvestors: Faisal Tabbah, Vice President Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0) 1279 775 306\nMedia: Nick Hasell, FTI Consulting\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1340\nNotes\nSynthomer plc is a leading supplier of high-performance, highly specialised polymers and ingredients that play vital roles in key sectors such as coatings, construction, adhesives, and health and protection - growing markets for customers who serve billions of end users worldwide.
