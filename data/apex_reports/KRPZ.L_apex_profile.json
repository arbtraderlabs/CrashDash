Throughout the six months, Elandsfontein continued operating in trial production while ramping up production.\nThe production ramp-up has been delayed due to the need to re-engineer components of the fines flotation circuit based on actual particle size distribution (PSD) observed in the orebody. Mining and processing have also been affected by early, unpredicted ore variability which led to implementation of more complex mining processes and challenged by limited operator experience in these changing conditions. Kropz Elandsfontein is assessing the hard bank and other challenging ore variants identified with high phosphate content within the ore body, to select the appropriate method of mining and processing to extract phosphate. This includes the need to assess the current Milling and Crushing unit.\nIn order to address the fine flotation challenges and the PSD shift observed in the ore body, the mine has partnered with a flotation equipment supplier and installed a new flotation cell (\"Turbocell\") with specific performance guarantees. The Turbocell has been installed in the period under review and has yielded good results.\nProduction throughput is also being limited by the excessive amount of slimes (ultra fine) material encountered in the ore deposit. Kropz Elandsfontein has invested in new equipment (\"centrifuge unit\") to improve its ability to handle the high quantities of slimes material which is yielding positive results.\nAlthough the centrifuge unit described above, was primarily installed to de-bottleneck throughput capacity and to provide relief in the tailings handling circuit it has unlocked an additional revenue stream, this being Nanophos.\nKropz Elandsfontein has identified an additional value opportunity within the ore body through the production of \"Nanophos,\" a sub 38-micron phosphate product that has historically been underutilised.\nVarious additional projects are being investigated to explore even more opportunities that had not previously been taken into consideration\n.\nNanophos had previously been considered a waste stream; however, with minimal processing cost it can also be granulated and positioned as a more attractive marketable product together with the ungranulated product that is currently being sold. The granulation provides additional higher sales value per tonne and opportunities to grow Nanophos, a previously disregarded fraction of the ore body and broaden the Company's product offering. The first Nanophos sales of $0.3 million were recognised during the period under review.\nA particular challenging ore variant called \"Pink Ore\" found within the ore deposit, is receiving major ongoing focus. The \"Pink Ore\" wash plant project was launched during the previous financial year and was successfully commissioned and aims to address some of the challenges that \"Pink Ore\" presents to the processing of the ore through the existing plant. Initial results show that the wash plant has had positive results and improved production yield.\nManagement is intently focused on addressing the various challenges.\nThe Elandsfontein mine is still in its trial production phase and further challenges may rise as it progresses towards full production.\nThe Company adheres to strict health and safety standards and international best practices. The safety of the Company's employees and other stakeholders remains a key focus point of management. Kropz continues to give back to local communities through various projects.\nKey financial indicators\n\u00b7\nElandsfontein recognised trial revenue during the six month period under review. In total, Elandsfontein achieved total sales of US$\u00a015.4 million for the six months ended 30 September 2025 (six months ended 30 September 2024: US$ 14.1 million).\nSales volumes are below expectations due to the lack of available stock on hand. Production has been negatively impacted by continued ore variability,\nfine flotation challenges, an excessive amount of slimes\nand lower than expected production yields. Yield has notably improved in recent months.\n\u00b7\nAs the Company is still ramping up to steady-state production, a gross loss has been recognised in the period of US$ 7.4 million (six months ended 30 September 2024: US$ 6.4 million). The loss was largely due to Elandsfontein having to discount its sales prices as a new market entrant and to consider lower grades being achieved as part of the ramp-up process, coupled with higher production costs per tonne. With Elandsfontein operating below planned production levels operational costs per tonne remain elevated.\n\u00b7\nProperty, plant, equipment and exploration assets carrying value is US$\n144\nmillion as at 30 September 2025 (31 March 2025: US$\u00a0133 million).\n\u00b7\nCash at 30 September 2025 of US$\u00a03.5 million (31 March 2025: US$\u00a03.0 million);\n\u00b7\nInventory at 30 September 2025 of US$ 9.5 million (31 March 2025: US$ 6.1 million);\n\u00b7\nShareholder loans\nand derivatives\nat 30 September 2025 of US$\u00a080.1 million (31 March 2025: US$\u00a064 million).\n\u00b7\nTrade and other payables at 30 September 2025 of US$\u00a014.5 million (31 March 2025: US$\u00a011.7 million).\n\u00b7\nOn\u00a025 April 2025,\u00a0Kropz Elandsfontein and ARC Fund\u00a0(\"ARC\") agreed to a ZAR\u00a0130 million\u00a0(approximately\u00a0US$\u00a06.7 million) loan facility (the \"Loan\") to meet cash requirements at Kropz Elandsfontein.\nInterest is payable on the Loan at the South African prime overdraft interest rate plus 6%, nominal per annum and compounded monthly. The Loan is repayable on the earlier of a date as agreed between the Parties or on demand from ARC, on no less than 15 business days' notice. There is no fixed term.\nThe Loan has been fully drawn.\n\u00b7\nOn\u00a014 July 2025,\u00a0Kropz Elandsfontein and ARC Fund\u00a0(\"ARC\") agreed to a ZAR\u00a0200 million\u00a0(approximately\u00a0US$\u00a011.4 million) loan facility (the \"Second Loan\") to meet cash requirements at Kropz Elandsfontein.\nInterest is payable on the Second Loan at the South African prime overdraft interest rate plus 6%, nominal per annum and compounded monthly. The Second Loan is repayable on the earlier of a date as agreed between the Parties or on demand from ARC, on no less than 15 business days' notice. There is no fixed term.\nThe\nSecond\nLoan has been fully drawn.\nKey corporate and operational developments during the period\nElandsfontein\n\u00b7\nBulk shipments and trial sales have been recorded with a total of 128,708 tonnes of phosphate concentrate sales over the six months ending 30 September 2025 from Elandsfontein. Elandsfontein\n, however, achieved lower sales prices compared to the prevailing market price. As a new entrant in the market, in order to gain market share Elandsfontein was required to offer discounted pricing to market participants. Furthermore, Elandsfontein produced lower grade phosphate product as part of its ramp-up operations, which also impacted the sales price. Elandsfontein is aiming to achieve better prices going forward in the market as both quality and market reputation improves.\n\u00b7\nSales volumes are below expectations due to the lack of available stock on hand. Production has been negatively impacted by continued ore variability,\nfine flotation challenges, an excessive amount of slimes\nand lower than expected production yields.\n\u00b7\nAs announced on 19 March 2025, a lawsuit has been lodged by the World Wildlife Fund South Africa (\"WWF-SA\") against\u00a0South Africa's\u00a0Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment\u00a0(\"DFFE\") over its decision to dismiss appeals against an environmental offset exemption granted to the Elandsfontein mine, which is owned by the Company. Kropz Elandsfontein intends to oppose the\u00a0WWF-SA\u00a0motion as the third Respondent and is taking legal advice regarding the matter.\nHinda\n\u00b7\nThe Company is still in the process of identifying potential funding solutions for the development of Hinda.\n\u00b7\nEngagement is ongoing with local government regarding project development and progress.\n\u00b7\nA reduced-sized project is being assessed to propose a fit-for-purpose low capex project to prove the concept of producing phosphate concentrate in the Congo and exporting it.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is also engaging with possible suppliers and third parties to investigate possible efficiencies and capital expenditure reductions in the proposed feasibility study.\nKey developments post the period end\nElandsfontein\n\u00b7\nPost period end, Elandsfontein achieved a new record production of 35,565 tonnes for the month of November 2025. Production of 64,925\u00a0tonnes of phosphate concentrate\u00a0and sales of 71,500\u00a0tonnes of phosphate concentrate were recognised\u00a0occurred during October 2025 to November 2025 amounting to US$8.0 million. A further sale of 38,500 tonnes was loaded during the first half December 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Company's rock phosphate has been qualified at customers in South Korea, Australia,\nNew Zealand\nand Brazil at both single superphosphate ('SSP\") and Phosphoric acid producers.\n\u00b7\nKropz's core customer base was narrowed down to focus on South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and\nBrazil\n, where the special properties of Kropz Rock Phosphate (Low levels of: - Cadmium, - toxic metals, - moisture, - odour and - CaO levels) are complementary to country rules dictating the final product properties.\n\u00b7\nAs Elandsfontein has yet to achieve break-even production levels and production ramp up is still ongoing the Group may be dependent on future fund raisings to meet any costs that cannot be met from existing cash resources and sales revenue.\n\u00b7\nOn\u00a08 December 2025,\u00a0Kropz Elandsfontein and ARC Fund\u00a0(\"ARC\") agreed to a ZAR\u00a0250 million\u00a0(approximately\u00a0US$\u00a014.4 million) loan facility (the \"Third Loan\") to meet cash requirements at Kropz Elandsfontein.\nInterest is payable on the\nThird\nLoan at the South African prime overdraft interest rate plus 6%, nominal per annum and compounded monthly. The\nThird\nLoan is repayable on the earlier of a date as agreed between the Parties or on demand from ARC, on no less than 15 business days' notice. There is no fixed term.\nZAR 150 million remains available to draw down on the Third Loan at the date of this report.\nHinda\n\u00b7\nThe reduced sized project continues to be assessed to propose a fit-for-purpose low capex project to prove the concept of producing phosphate concentrate in the Congo and exporting it. The update of the project feasibility is ongoing. Cominco has engaged with two engineering firms and local contractors.\n\u00b7\nThe Company continues to invest in and prioritise ongoing community projects.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"UK MAR\") which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

General information\nKropz and its subsidiaries (together \"the Group\") is an emerging plant nutrient producer with an advanced stage phosphate mining project in South Africa, Elandsfontein, and a phosphate project in the RoC, Hinda. The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company for the Group, as well as performing all administrative, corporate finance, strategic and governance functions of the Group and providing services to Group companies.\nThe Company was incorporated on 10 January 2018 and is a public limited company, with its ordinary shares admitted to the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange on 30 November 2018 trading under the symbol, \"KRPZ\". The Company is domiciled in England and incorporated and registered in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is 35 Verulam Road, Hitchin, SG5 1QE. The registered number of the Company is 11143400.\n2.\nBasis of preparation\nThese interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the AIM rules and in accordance with the accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2025. They do not include all disclosures that would otherwise be required in a complete set of financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2025 annual report. The statutory financial statements for the period ended 31\u00a0March 2025 were prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").\nThe interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise stated in the accounting policies. They are presented in United States Dollars, the presentation currency of the Group and figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand.\nThe interim financial information is unaudited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim financial information was approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 December 2025.\n3. Going concern\nDuring the six month interim period ended 30 September 2025, the Group incurred a loss of US$\u00a06.1 million (12 months ended 31 March 2025: Loss of US$ 7.9 million) and experienced net cash outflows from operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents totalled US$\u00a03.5 million as at 30 September 2025 (31 March 2025: US$\u00a03.0 million).\nElandsfontein is currently the Group's only operating asset and source of revenue. As Elandsfontein is still ramping up its operations and has yet to achieve break-even production levels, an operating loss is also expected in the year following the date of these accounts. Although the Elandsfontein production levels are expected to increase over the next 12 months, there remains a risk that these improvements could be delayed or not result in sufficient increases in production levels to achieve break even. As such, the Group may consequently be dependent on future fundraisings to meet any production costs, overheads, future development and exploration requirements that cannot be met from existing cash resources and sales revenue.\nThe Group announced on 3 September 2024, a restructuring of its debt obligations (\"Restructuring\") and a fundraising. As a result of the Restructuring, Kropz Elandsfontein (Pty) Ltd and Kropz Elandsfontein Land Holdings (Pty) Ltd (the \"Elandsfontein Subsidiaries\") extinguished their debt obligations to ARC through a combination of new issuances of equity and convertible debt instruments. Kropz has a convertible debt of \u00a3105.4 million (including accumulated interest) outstanding with ARC, being the aggregate of a new Convertible Loan Note (\"CLN\") issued as part of the restructuring and existing equity facilities (the \"Existing Equity Facilities\"). Additionally, Kropz completed a capital raise of \u00a38.9 million from ARC and other shareholders before expenses through the issue of new ordinary shares at an issue price of 1.387 pence per new ordinary share in the capital of the Company (the \"Fundraising\"). The issue price represented a discount of approximately 5 per cent to the 30-day volume weighted average share price per existing ordinary share to 23 August 2024. In aggregate 643,873,018 new ordinary shares were allotted and issued pursuant to the Fundraising. Both the Restructuring and Fundraising were concluded during the year ended 31 March 2025.\nOperational cash flows\nNo impairment reversal or impairment has been recognised as at 30 September 2025.\nThe going concern assessment was performed using the Group's 12-month cash flow forecast. The Group's going concern assessment and forecast cash flows are largely driven by Elandsfontein, as the Group's only operating asset. Elandsfontein's forecast cashflows are based on its latest mine plan.\nElandsfontein's forecast cashflows were estimated using market-based commodity prices, exchange rate assumptions, estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, production levels, operating costs and capital requirements over a 12-month period. The going concern assessment only considered Elandsfontein's resources defined as \"measured\" and \"indicated\" per the MRE. The resource classified as \"inferred\" was not considered part of the mine plan for purposes of the going concern assessment. However, it is expected that as mining and drilling activities progress, progressively more of the total resource will be reclassified from inferred to measured and indicated.\nThe critical estimates in the forecast cashflows expected to be generated can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nPhosphate rock prices and grade;\n\u00b7\nPhosphate recoveries;\n\u00b7\nOperating costs;\n\u00b7\nForeign exchange rates;\nThe going concern assessment and forecast cashflows are highly sensitive to these estimates.\nPhosphate rock prices and grade\n: Forecast phosphate rock prices are based on management's estimates of quality of production and selling price and are derived from forward price curves and long-term views of global supply and demand in a changing environment, particularly with respect to climate risk, building on past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.\nIn total Elandsfontein managed to achieve trial production sales totalling US$ 15.4 million during the interim period (\nPeriod ended 31 March 2025: US$ 37.2 million)\n. Since 30 September 2025 and up to 30 November 2025 an additional US$ 8.0 million sales have been made.\nKropz is and remains a new entrant to the phosphate market and has to date sold its shipments at a discount to prevailing market prices. The discount was taken into account in the going concern testing models. The discount is, however, expected to unwind as Elandsfontein builds its reputation, establishes itself in the global market and improves its production quality and stability. As modifications are planned and efficiency improvements are implemented at Elandsfontein, Elandsfontein should see a gradual improvement in both grade and quality, some of which have already materialised.\nPhosphate recoveries:\nEstimated production volumes are based on detailed LOM plans of the measured and indicated resource as defined in the MRE and take into account development plans for the mine agreed upon by management as part of the long-term planning process. Production volumes are dependent on a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities; the production profile; the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to extract the reserves; the production costs; the contractual duration of mining rights; and the selling price of the commodities extracted.\nEstimated production volumes are subject to significant uncertainty given the ongoing ramp-up. The production ramp-up has been delayed largely by the need to re-engineer parts of the fine flotation circuit proposed by the vendor. Mining and processing have also been affected by early unpredicted ore variability and lack of operator experience. The Company is in the process of assessing the hard bank and pink ore material to identify the appropriate method of mining and processing to improve production yield. Production throughput is also being limited by the nature of slimes material and the Company has invested in new equipment to seek to overcome this and aims to increase production throughput.\nReserves and resources:\nThe LOM plan includes only the\nmeasured and indicated resources as defined in the MRE which represents only around 9 years of forecast production. The Directors believe that the inferred resources in the MRE are capable of being accessed giving a mine life of around 12 years, but this has not been taken into account in the cashflows.\nExchange rates\n: Foreign exchange rates are estimated with reference to external market forecasts. The assumed long-term US dollar/ZAR exchange rate is based\non a consensus for the period to year 2028. Future years' exchange rates were estimated using the prevailing inflation and interest rate differential between USD and ZAR.\nOperating cost\n: Operating costs are estimated with reference to contractual and actual current costs adjusted for inflation. Key operating cost estimates are mine and plant operating costs and transportation and port costs. The forecast mine and plant costs were based on the contracted rates with the current mine and plant operators. Production cost per tonne currently is higher than sales price per tonne as full production has not been reached to date, leading to a gross loss per tonne. The forecast assumes that as production volumes increase the average production cost per tonne of phosphate will decrease with economies of scale and further efficiency gains.\nMine and plant operating costs:\nThe forecast mine and plant costs were based on the contracted rates with the current mine and plant operators.\nPort costs\n: The Group has a draft port access agreement with Transnet for Saldanha port but this has not yet been signed. The Group has paid guest port charges (the higher rates were used in the forecast) for Saldanha for the shipments to date.\nFunding\nThe Group is dependent on future fundraisings to meet production costs, overheads, future development and exploration requirements that cannot be met from existing cash resources and sales revenue alone.\nThe ARC Fund, on various occasions in the past, provided funding to support the Group's operations. During the period ending 30 September 2025, Kropz Elandsfontein and ARC Fund\u00a0(\"ARC\") agreed to ZAR\u00a0330 million\u00a0(approximately\u00a0US$\u00a018.1 million)\nbridge loan facilities.\nSubsequent to the period ending, Kropz Elandsfontein and ARC Fund agreed to a further ZAR 250 million (approximately US$ 14.4 million) bridge loan facility.\nManagement has successfully raised money in the past from its supportive major shareholder, but there is no guarantee that any additional funds that might be required will be available if needed in the future. Management have also obtained confirmation from the ARC fund that they do not intend to recall their loans within 12 months from the date of this report.\nGoing concern basis\nBased on the Group's current available reserves, recent operational performance, forecast production and sales coupled with Management's track record to successfully raise additional funds as and when required, to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and the ARC Fund stating that the loans due will not be recalled within 12 months from the interim financial statements, the Board have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and at least for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements.\nFor these reasons, the interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nAs there can be no guarantee that any additional funding that might be required can be raised in the necessary timeframe, a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe interim financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern.\n4.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe Company has applied the same accounting policies, presentation, methods of computation, significant judgements and the key sources of estimation uncertainties in its interim consolidated financial statements as in its audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\n(i)\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments adopted from 1 April 2025\nThe following new standards and amendments are effective for the period beginning on or after 1 January 2025\n:\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rate: Lack of Exchangeability\nThe Group has considered the above new standards and amendments and has concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or they do not have a significant impact on the Group's interim financial statements.\n(ii) New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective\nAt the date of authorisation of these consolidated Group financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective. Management is currently assessing the impact of these new standards on the Group.\nEffective annual periods beginning before or after\nAmendments to the Measurement and Classification of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7)\n1st\u00a0January 2026\nContracts Referencing Nature-Dependent Electricity (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7)\n1st\u00a0January 2026\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n1st\u00a0January 2027\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures\n1st January 2027\n5. Production start date\nThe Group assesses the stage of each mine under development/construction to determine when a mine moves into the production phase, this being when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the unique nature of the mine development. The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the production phase is considered to have commenced. At this point, all related amounts are reclassified from \"trial production\" to \"steady state production\".\nSome of the criteria used to identify the production start date include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 The percentage grade (phosphate concentrate) and volume of ore being mined is sufficiently economic and consistent with the plant design specifications;\n\u2022 Ability to produce phosphate in saleable form (within specifications); and\n\u2022 Ability to sustain ongoing production of phosphate.\nWhen the mine moves into the steady state production, the capitalisation of certain mine development costs ceases and costs are either regarded as forming part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for the costs that qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, or mineable reserve development. It is also at this point that depreciation/amortisation commences. Refer to Note 7.\n6.\nSegmental information\nOperating segments\nThe Board of Directors consider that the Group has one operating segment, being that of phosphate mining and exploration. Accordingly, all revenues, operating results, assets and liabilities are allocated to this activity.\nGeographical segments\nThe Group operates in two principal geographical areas - South Africa and the RoC.\nThe Group's revenues and non-current assets by location of assets are detailed below.\nSix months to 30 September 2025\nRevenues\nUS$'000\nNon-Current Assets\nUS$'000\nSouth Africa\n15,435\n100,901\nRepublic of Congo\n-\n47,702\n15,435\n148,603\nTwelve months to 31 March 2025\nRevenues\nUS$'000\nNon-Current Assets\nUS$'000\nSouth Africa\n37,211\n93,061\nRepublic of Congo\n-\n43,804\n37,211\n136,865\n7.

Interest is payable at 14% nominal, compounded monthly. At any time during the term of the ZAR 200 Million Equity Facility, repayment of the ZAR 200 Million Equity Facility capital amount will, at the election of ARC, either be in the form of the conversion into ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each (\"Ordinary Shares\") in the Company and issued to ARC, at a conversion price of 4.5058 pence per Ordinary Share each, representing the 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price (\"VWAP\") on 21\u00a0September 2021, and at fixed exchange rate of GBP 1 = ZAR 20.24 (\"Conversion\"), or payable in cash by the Company at the end of the term of the ZAR 200 Million Equity Facility which is 16 October 2027. The Company made a drawdown of ZAR 90 million of the ZAR 200 Million Equity Facility on 26 October 2021 and a further ZAR 37 million on 9\u00a0December 2021. Two further draw downs were made in 2022, one on 25 March 2022 for ZAR 40 million and ZAR 33 million on 26 April 2022. The ZAR 200 Million Equity Facility is fully\ndrawn at the date of this report.\nAs announced on 11 May 2022, the Company entered into a new conditional convertible equity facility of up to ZAR 177 million (\"ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility\") with ARC. Interest is payable at 14% nominal, compounded monthly. At any time during the term of the ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility, repayment of the ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility capital amount will, at the election of ARC, either be in the form of the conversion into Ordinary Shares in the Company and issued to ARC, at a conversion price of 9.256 pence per Ordinary Share each, representing the 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price (\"VWAP\") on 4\u00a0May 2022, and at fixed exchange rate of ZAR 1 = GBP 0.0504 (\"Conversion\"), or payable in cash by the Company\nat the end of the term of the ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility which is 16\u00a0October 2027\n. The first drawdown on the ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility occurred on 2 June 2022 for ZAR 103.5 million. The second drawdown on the ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility was made on 7 July 2022 for ZAR 60 million. On 9 August 2022, a final drawdown on the ZAR 177 Million Equity Facility was made for ZAR 13.5 million.\nThe ZAR\u00a0177 Million Equity Facility is fully drawn at the date of this report.\nAs announced on 14 November 2022, the Company entered into a new conditional convertible equity facility of up to ZAR 550 million (\"ZAR 550 Million Equity Facility\") with ARC. Interest is payable at the South African prime overdraft interest rate plus 6%, nominal per annum and compounded monthly. At any time during the term of the ZAR 550 Million Equity Facility, repayment of the ZAR\u00a0550 Million Equity Facility capital amount will, at the election of ARC, either be in the form of the conversion into Ordinary Shares in the Company and issued to ARC, at a conversion price of 4.579 pence per Ordinary Share each, representing the 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price (\"VWAP\") on 21 October 2022 and at fixed exchange rate of ZAR 1 = GBP 0.048824 (\"Conversion\"), or payable in cash by the Company at the end of the term of the ZAR 550 Million Equity Facility which is 16 October 2027. The Company drew down a further ZAR 107.5 million during the 15-month period\nand\nwa\ns fully drawn\nat the date of this report\n.\nThe Company entered into a new conditional convertible equity facility of up to ZAR 821 million (\"ZAR 821 Million Equity Facility\") with ARC on 17 October 2024. Interest is payable at the South African prime overdraft interest rate plus 6%, nominal per annum and compounded monthly. At any time during the term of the ZAR 821 Million Equity Facility, repayment of the ZAR\u00a0821 Million Equity Facility capital amount will, at the election of ARC, either be in the form of the conversion into Ordinary Shares in the Company and issued to ARC, at a conversion price of 1.46 pence per Ordinary Share each, representing the 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price (\"VWAP\") on 23 August 2024 and at fixed exchange rate of ZAR 1 = GBP 0.0427 (\"Conversion\"), or payable in cash by the Company at the end of the term of the ZAR 821 Million Equity Facility which is 16\u00a0October 2029. The Company accessed the full loan on 17 October 2024\nand it has been fully drawn\nat the date of this report\n.\nDerivative liability\nIt was determined that the conversion option embedded in the convertible debt equity facility be accounted for separately as a derivative liability. Although the amount to be settled is fixed in ZAR, when converted back to Kropz's functional currency will result in a variable amount of cash based on the exchange rate at the date of conversion. The value of the liability component and the derivative conversion component were determined at the date of draw down using a Monte Carlo simulation. The debt host liability was bifurcated based on the determined value of the option. Subsequently, the embedded derivative liability is adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end with changes in fair value recorded in profit and loss (refer to Note 19).\nFair value of shareholder loans\nThe carrying value of the loans approximates their fair value.\n10.

Interest is payable on the Loan at the South African prime overdraft interest rate plus 6%, nominal per annum and compounded monthly. The Loan is repayable on the earlier of a date as agreed between the Parties or on demand from ARC, on no less than 15 business days' notice. There is no fixed term.\nAs announced on 21 May 2025 and 28 May 2025, Kropz SA (Pty) Ltd has issued\u00a0a Guarantee, Security Cession and Pledge in favour of ARC, and Kropz Plc has issued a Limited Indemnity, Security Cession and Pledge in favour of ARC for all current and future loan facilities made to Elandsfontein, which are applicable to the Loan.\nThe Loan will be used by Elandsfontein to fund its cashflow and operational expenditure needs.\nThe Company will update the market on drawdown of the Loan in due course.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe Loan is a related party transaction pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Gerrit Duminy, a director of the Company, is the representative of ARC. Accordingly, Gerrit Duminy has not been involved in the approval of the Loan by the Company's board. The directors of the Company, who are considered independent for the purposes of the Loan, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, consider the terms of the Loan to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nFor further information visit\nwww.kropz.com\nor contact:\nKropz Plc\nVia Tavistock\nLouis Loubser (CEO)\n+44 (0) 207\u00a0920 3150\nGrant Thornton UK LLP\nNominated Adviser\nSamantha Harrison\nHarrison Clarke\nCiara Donnelly\n+44 (0) 20 7383 5100\nHannam & Partners\nBroker\nAndrew Chubb\n+44 (0) 20 7907 8500\nTavistock\nFinancial PR & IR (UK)\nNick Elwes\nJos Simson\n+44 (0) 207 920 3150\nkropz@tavistock.co.uk\nR&A Strategic Communications\nPR (South Africa)\nCharmane Russell\nMarion Brower\n+27 (0) 11 880 3924\ncharmane@rasc.co.za\nmarion@rasc.co.za\nAbout Kropz Plc\nKropz is an emerging African phosphate producer and developer with projects in South Africa and in the Republic of Congo.
