Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nEnquiries:\nDillistone Group Plc\nGiles Fearnley\nChairman\n01256 297 000\nJason Starr\nChief Executive Officer\nIan Mackin\nFinance Director\nZeus (Nominated adviser and Broker)\nMike Coe\nDirector, Investment Banking\n020 3829 5000\nChairman's Statement\nOver the last few years, I've found myself reporting on a fairly consistent theme. A challenging market for recruitment software, improvements in EBITDA margin, acceptable performance for our contingency targeted products, let down by disappointing performance for our executive search solutions.\nAt face value, H1 2025 represents more of the same. EBITDA margin has improved once again (H1 2025 26.8% vs H1 2024 25.8%), our executive search performance has been poor, while our contingency products report both positive and negative results.\nThe bulk of our executive search revenue comes from our FileFinder platform and this has unquestionably lost market share over recent years. Our Talentis product was designed to be its successor and, until recently, revenue has disappointed. I am delighted to report, however, that recent months have seen a dramatic upturn in performance for this platform, and I take pleasure in providing more details on this transformation below.\nExecutive search review:\nAs noted above, our executive search business has struggled over recent years, but we are pleased to report signs of real progress, driven by our flagship Talentis product.\nTalentis was conceived as an all-in-one candidate sourcing / CRM platform for executive search. When initially launched, it had primary strengths as a sourcing tool, but CRM functionality was considered light by many buyers.\nAs a result, many of the early buyers of Talentis purchased it primarily for its sourcing functionality. The revenue associated with this was of low quality, with many of the subscriptions being on a month-to-month basis and of low value.\nIn Q4 of last year, we reached the conclusion that the product had reached a level where it was feature rich enough to be marketed as a successor platform to FileFinder and competitor CRMs. As a result, we subsequently positioned the product differently and increased its prices.\nDuring the period in review, we saw our first \"full\" migrations into Talentis. Client feedback has been very positive, with a number of 5* executive search software reviews for Talentis appearing on G2:\nhttps://www.g2.com/products/talentis-executive-search-software/reviews\nDuring 2025, the mix of clients has changed away from sourcing customers paying on a month to month basis, towards CRM customers on annually recurring contracts. Indeed, while only 22% of new users signed in 2024 were under annual (or longer) commitments, the figure in 2025 M1-M8 has risen to 59%, and with the figure for M6-M8 up to 85%.\nThese new customers often have more users and often pay a higher price.\nThe change in positioning has caused the number of clients on the platform to fall during the early part of the year. However, since then, the number of licenced users and MRR have both increased with much of that increase happening in Q3. Exit MRR at the end of Q3 is likely be 19% up on the equivalent figure at the end of Q4 2024, and well over 30% up on the end of Q2 2025.\nTalentis remains a low part of our overall revenue, but it is now our fastest growing product - both in terms of new customer logos and migrations. While much of the revenue growth in Q2-Q3 came from FileFinder migrations into Talentis, our contracted orders for Q4 indicates a far higher percentage of revenue coming from clients that are new to the Group. This includes our largest competitive displacement in the executive search sector for over five years.\nOur Talentis B2C product, which trades under the name \"GatedTalent\", continues to make a contribution.\nContingency review:\nAs has been previously mentioned, the recruitment market in general has struggled over the past few years and the contingent space has been no exception. Organisations across the globe have been reducing their permanent and temporary headcount requirements.\nThe majority of our contingency clients are based in the UK which specifically has shown a significant and sustained downturn since the 2022 post-Covid peak. The ONS reports a drop of roughly 45% in vacancies over the past three years. This directly impacts the recruitment agency market and this is felt by us through clients reducing their own staff and hence licence numbers.\nWhilst a nervous economic background has led to an overall reduction in user numbers over the last 12 months, there is some early evidence of recovery. We have seen a recent small upturn in the number of customers purchasing additional licences for our Infinity product as well as the number of licences in each transaction. On a rolling 6-month basis, additional licence sales from existing customers are up just under 50% compared to June 2024.\nIn the period we rolled out first phase of our Mid-Office Online Timesheet solution to positive feedback from the users. The second phase which expands its functional capability to appeal to a wider user base was put on general release towards the end of Q3.\nWe are pleased to report the continued adoption of our Candidate Portal add-on for our Infinity product and a further significant update to this portal adding functionality to support shift offers and selection is due to be released by the end of the year. In August, we also released an improved version of our consultant mobile app, Infinity Connect, and in addition we are looking forward to releasing the further enhancements to the AI features for the core Infinity product in Q4.\nThe above additions, along with our ongoing development of these products, have enabled our contingent new business sales in H1 to exceed those in the whole of FY24.\nOur ISV product has seen a number of enhancements delivered to the customer base along with a significant improvement to the test score and results systems. Furthermore, the previous work undertaken to enhance our content creation infrastructure has meant we have been able to efficiently deliver a number of bespoke client requests in the period. Whilst not directly attributable to these product enhancements we have seen increased order volumes for ISV in comparison to prior year.\nFinancial performance\nRevenue\nGroup revenue in H1 FY2025 reduced to \u00a32.173m from \u00a32.519m in H1 FY2024.\nRecurring revenues decreased by 14% to \u00a31.966m over the comparable period last year (2024: \u00a32.293m).\nRecurring revenues represented 91% of total revenues (2024: 91%). Non-recurring revenues were down 14% at \u00a30.150m (2024: \u00a30.175m).\nAdjusted EBITDA*\nThe adjusted EBITDA* decreased by 10% to \u00a30.583m from \u00a30.650m in H1 FY2024. This however still resulted in another increase in EBITDA margin to 26.8%, compared to 25.8% in H1 FY2024.\nOperating profit/(loss) and profit/(loss) before tax\nThe Group operating profit, before acquisition related, reorganisation and other items, decreased by 41% to stand at \u00a30.079m from \u00a30.133m in H1 FY2024.\nInclusive of acquisition related and other items, the operating profit was \u00a30.024m compared to a profit of \u00a30.065m in H1 FY2024.\nThe loss before tax increased to (\u00a30.048m) from (\u00a30.015m) in H1 FY2024.\nTaxation\nThe net tax credit for H1 is \u00a30.028m (H1 FY2024: \u00a30.006m).\nBalance sheet\nThe Group's net assets increased slightly to \u00a33.288m (H1 FY2024: \u00a33.206m) with trade and other receivables decreasing to \u00a30.310m (H1 FY2024: \u00a30.493m). Trade and other payables also decreased to \u00a31.509m (H1 FY2024: \u00a32.005m).\nR&D development\nThe Group capitalised \u00a30.414m in development costs in the period (H1 FY2024: \u00a30.436m) as the business continued its commitment to developing its products. Amortisation of development costs was \u00a30.485m (H1 FY2024: \u00a30.489m)\nFinancing\nThe CBIL loan balance stands at \u00a30.300m (31 December 2024: \u00a30.450m) and, on the current payment profile, will be repaid by June 2026.\nThe Group also has two convertible loans totalling \u00a30.700m (31 December 2024: \u00a30.700m), which will not be repaid until the CBIL loan has been repaid. The two convertible loans were made by current and former Directors of the Group.\nThe Group also added in FY2025 H1 a loan agreement to a related party totalling \u00a30.120m (31 December 2024: \u00a3nil).\nCashflow\nNet cash generated from operating activities was broadly unchanged at \u00a30.528m (2024: \u00a30.529m).\nNet change in cash improved by 97% to (\u00a30.004m) (H1 FY2024: (\u00a30.153m)).\nAt 30 June 2025, we had a utilisation of our bank facility of (\u00a30.080m) (2024: utilisation \u00a30.172m).\nSummarised cashflow\nH1 FY2025\nH1 FY2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAdjusted net cash from normalised operating activities\n528\n529\nInvesting Activities - net\n(419)\n(441)\nFinancial Activities - net\n(113)\n(241)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(4)\n(153)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n(74)\n(19)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes\n(2)\n-\nCash and cash equivalents at 30th June\n(80)\n(172)\nOutlook\nWe are now seeing positive momentum with our Talentis product. While this momentum will come too late to change the shape of our numbers in 2025, I am pleased to confirm that the Group expects to deliver results in line with expectations for EBITDA and adjusted pre-tax profit in 2025\nI am also pleased to report that we now expect 2026 to be our first year of revenue growth since 2022 and only our second since 2016. We believe that much of that growth will be driven by Talentis.\nGiles Fearnley\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nNote\n6 Months ended 30 June\nYear ended 31 Dec\n2025\n2024\n2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n4\n2,173\n2,519\n4,903\nCost of sales\n(224)\n(269)\n(503)\nGross profit\n1,949\n2,250\n4,400\nAdministrative expenses\n(1,925)\n(2,185)\n(4,235)\nResult from operating activities\n4\n24\n65\n165\nAnalysed as:\nResult from operating activities before acquisition related, reorganisation and other items\n79\n133\n269\nAcquisition related, reorganisation and other items\n5\n(55)\n(68)\n(104)\nResult after acquisition related items\n24\n65\n165\nFinancial cost\n(72)\n(80)\n(152)\n(Loss) / Profit before tax\n(48)\n(15)\n13\nTax income\n6\n28\n6\n27\n(Loss) / Profit for the period\n(20)\n(9)\n40\nOther comprehensive income net of tax:\nCurrency translation differences\n(7)\n(2)\n(4)\nTotal comprehensive (loss) / income for period net of tax\n(27)\n(11)\n36\nEarnings per share (pence)\nBasic\n8\n(0.10)\n(0.05)\n0.20\nDiluted\n(0.10)\n(0.05)\n0.20\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at 30 June 2025\nAs at 30 June 2024\nAs at 31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nASSETS\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nNon-current assets\nGoodwill\n3,415\n3,415\n3,415\nIntangible assets\n2,520\n2,700\n2,618\nRight of use assets\n193\n219\n206\nProperty plant & equipment\n13\n19\n14\n6,141\n6,353\n6,253\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n310\n493\n430\nCurrent tax receivable\n-\n-\n1\nCash and cash equivalents\n-\n-\n-\n310\n493\n431\nTotal assets\n6,451\n6,846\n6,684\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nEquity\nShare capital\n1,021\n983\n1,021\nShare premium\n1,653\n1,631\n1,653\nMerger reserve\n365\n365\n365\nConvertible loan reserve\n14\n14\n14\nRetained earnings\n150\n91\n170\nShare option reserve\n29\n57\n29\nTranslation reserve\n56\n65\n63\nTotal equity\n3,288\n3,206\n3,315\nLiabilities\nNon current liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n116\n169\n148\nLease liabilities\n181\n3\n182\nBorrowings\n820\n700\n850\nDeferred tax\n223\n236\n223\nTotal\nnon-current liabilities\n1,340\n1,108\n1,403\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n1,393\n1,836\n1,564\nLease liabilities\n18\n218\n28\nBorrowings\n300\n300\n300\nCurrent tax payable\n32\n6\n-\nUtilisation of bank facility\n80\n172\n74\nTotal\nnon-current liabilities\n1,823\n2,532\n1,966\nTotal liabilities\n3,163\n3,640\n3,369\nTotal liabilities and equity\n6,451\n6,846\n6,684\nThe interim report was approved by the Board of directors and authorised for issue on 29 September 2025.

It has been prepared\nin accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards\nbut does not include all of the disclosures that would be required under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The accounting policies applied by the Group in this financial information are the same as those applied by the Group in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 and are those which will form the basis of the 2025 financial statements.\nThe comparative financial information presented herein for the year ended 31 December 2024 does not constitute full statutory accounts for that period. The Group's annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Group's independent auditor's report on those statutory accounts was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis, and did not contain a statement under 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nGoing concern\nThe directors have continued to perform detailed forecasting on a regular basis taking into account current trading and expectations and cash balances and, having reflected upon these forecasts, the directors of the Company continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nDillistone Group Plc is the Group's ultimate parent company. It is a public listed company and is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office and principal place of business is 9 Cedarwood, Crockford Lane, Chineham Business Park, Basingstoke, RG24 8WD. Dillistone Group Plc's shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).\n2. Share Based Payments\nThe Company operates two share option schemes. The fair value of the options granted under these schemes is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period at the end of which the option holder may exercise the option. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model.\n3.

The proceeds from the Loan will therefore be used to provide the Group with additional working capital.\nThe Loan Agreement, which will be drawn down fully when required by the Company, will be provided by Yuriko Starr, the wife of the Group CEO.\nThe Loan is unsecured and ranks behind the Company's other existing debt in terms of capital repayments. The Loan carries an interest coupon of 10.85 percent pa over the term of 48 months. Interest will be payable quarterly in arrears and will be satisfied in cash. Capital and interest may be paid in full or in part at the discretion of the Company at any time during the term of the loan.\nThe issue of the Loan Agreement constitutes a related party transaction under AIM Rule 13. The independent Directors of the Company, having consulted with Zeus Capital Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, consider that the terms of the Loan Agreement are fair and reasonable insofar as Dillistone shareholders are concerned.\nEnquiries:\nDillistone Group Plc\nGiles Fearnley\nChairman\n01256 297 000\nJason Starr\nChief Executive Officer\nIan Mackin\nFinance Director\nZeus (Nominated adviser and Broker)\nMike Coe\nDirector,\nInvestment Banking\n020 3829 5000\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK version of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\").
