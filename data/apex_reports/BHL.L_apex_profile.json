Preliminary bench-scale results indicate the ore is suitable to ore sorting enhancement, offering significant potential cost savings during mining construction and operation\n.\nIan Stalker, Chair of Bradda Head, commented:\n\"As summer ends, the Company is optimistic about the future of lithium and is positioned to ride the upcoming wave of momentum through its quality and diverse portfolio. Lithium prices have stabilized and are witnessing a steady increase as supply lines have tightened and mine permitting in China temporarily postponed\noperations at\nsome key producers. Advances continue in the lithium oil-brine space in Arkansas and Texas with large acquisitions and mergers, highlighting long term commitments to developing lithium in the USA.\nOur strategy is to maintain a lean and nimble experienced team with focused exploration efforts on the identification of opportunities within our own portfolio whilst also examining the potential acquisition of new projects; whether they're open for staking or joint venture. All permits are in hand for San Domingo to advance this project, whilst further permitting continues on Basin West where the final stages of the Environmental Assessment permit are being fine tuned for delivery to the BLM, once our internal consultants finalize important reviews.\nThe Company continued discussions with a lithium oil brine development company, ongoing through the summer, to potentially acquire or lease our properties in Texas and Pennsylvania and,while these discussions remain at a high level, we are encouraged by the direction of the discussions.\nLastly, the Company continues looking for high quality lithium projects to complement San Domingo and has been conducting regional prospecting on pegmatites not previously described on geologic maps or in historic literature. There is optimism a new, unknown lithium bearing pegmatite could be hiding in plain sight, only to be discovered with diligent field examination. The team maintains its commitment to discovering a new pegmatite swarm in Arizona which is proximal to our existing projects.\"\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU No. 596/2014) AS IT FORMS PART OF\u00a0UK\u00a0DOMESTIC LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE\u00a0EUROPEAN UNION\u00a0(WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018.

The Company sees gradual and steady improvements in the lithium markets and\u00a0continues to focus our efforts on key projects and to ensure the Company is ready to advance quickly when the market changes. The Company is also seeking new opportunities, constantly assessing if they merit acquisition and meet Company thresholds of potentially becoming economically feasible.\nBasin Project\nDuring April 2025, the Company received notice of acceptance of the amended Exploration Plan of Operation (\"EPO\") at Basin West, both in the state of Arizona and on Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") lands. The\u00a0amended EPO at Basin West includes changes to build drill pads and construct new access routes to the area. The Company has initiated the writing of the EA (Environmental Assessment) which is required for the BLM to review and approve but also will be open for public comment and further scrutiny. While we could have pursued the Fast-41 permitting route (a 15-day process) as a means of pushing through the EA, dialog with the Kingman BLM settled upon the finalization of the EA process directly with them to avoid potential lawsuits and receive priority status. Prior to sending the draft EA to the BLM, we will have our internal environmental consultants review for accuracy but feel confident this is the correct course.\nBradda Head's Chief Operations Officer, Joey Wilkins, and Bradda Head's geologist, Brendan Fenerty, spearheaded the Company's contribution to a publication released in the Society of Economic Geologists by members of the Arizona Geological Survey, in collaboration with Bradda Head, on the article titled: Geology, Geochemistry, and Potential Origins of the\u00a0Basin\u00a0Volcano-Sedimentary Lithium Deposit, Kaiser Spring Volcanic Field, Northwestern Arizona, U.S.A.\nWikieup Project\nThe Company completed surface reconnaissance over clay exposures on the new land acquired in the claim exchange with Arizona Lithium. The work confirms the widespread presence of green to tan clays that resemble those surrounding the Big Sandy resource, thus proving the land swap enhanced the Company's opportunity to expand exploration drill targets in the clay environment. Arizona Lithium Corp, prior owners of the Big Sandy clay resource, have sold their interest to NTEC, the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, and New Mexico based tribal group that develops energy through the mining of coal, but have limited experience in lithium.\nSan Domingo Project\nDuring April 2025, the Company released the results of a mineral particle ore-sorting study announced in October 2024. The program was conducted on a spodumene composite ore sample from San Domingo's core drilling in 2023, and was supervised by ABH Engineering Inc.\nThe interpretive and preliminary bench-scale results indicate the spodumene ore is amenable to ore sorting enhancement, which can provide significant potential cost savings during mining construction and operation, as well as identifying a low water usage quick and efficient route to sustainable operation\nHighlights from the study include:\n\u00b7\nResults are indicative of potentially producing an in-country direct shipping spodumene ore after particle mineral sorting and separation of wall rock and waste material;\n\u00b7\nWaste product containing virtually 0% Lithium, a sellable aggregate product for the local Arizona infrastructure demand;\n\u00b7\nIntermediate product containing low grade lithium would be stockpiled for further treatment;\n\u00b7\nRecommendations to implement a Phase 2 test with a representative bulk sample (300-500kg);\n\u00b7\nExamine economic optimization including potential stockpiling; and\n\u00b7\nLowering resource cut-off grade.\nFollowing this, the Company received\napproval of bonding on Notice of Intent (\"NOI\") drilling permits at San Domingo, in the state of Arizona and on Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") lands.\nHighlights include:\n\u00b7\nBond approval on the Dragon NOI by the BLM to build 37 drill pads on the North and South targets;\n\u00b7\nBond approval on the San Domingo North NOI by the BLM to build 35 drill pads on the Ruby Soho, Midnight Owl, and Lone Giant targets; and\n\u00b7\nAcquired a mineral lease for 160 acres of Arizona State Lands at San Domingo where new outcrops of spodumene bearing pegmatites were discovered.\nExploration Opportunities\nRegional reconnaissance has been extended beyond the property boundaries at both San Domingo and Basin with a program looking for new opportunities in pegmatites and clays throughout Arizona. New target areas were identified through detailed review of governmental datasets that include geochemical surveys and mineral/mine localities. The work has led to the identification and detection of large belts of pegmatites and sedimentary basins containing clays worthy of field examination. The reconnaissance style field work encountered lithium-anomalous clays and pegmatites with beryl and muscovite, but none containing significant spodumene. Additional areas of pegmatites have been identified further to the northern part of Arizona, but yet to be examined pending a more robust budget. These new areas are of interest as competitors are active in the area searching for REE's, revealing the potential for a mineral-rich belt.\nThe Company examined a spodumene-bearing property in North Carolina within the well known Spodumene-Tin belt and in proximity to Kings Mountain (Albemarle), but decided it was too small for acquisition, and commercial terms couldn't be reached with the owners.\nThe Company has reviewed lithium brine properties in Nevada that offer unique characteristics with potential synergies to the Wilson and Eureka brine projects, with evaluations ongoing at a high level.\nTexas Brines\nThe Company continues to maintain positions throughout the Texas brine space and has been engaged with a lithium-brine development company discussing options and potential collaboration for future work. Discussions are purely high level and have not resulted in any agreements or MOUs.\nPennsylvania Brines\nThe Company continues to maintain our position with the Pennsylvania oil brine asset and is evaluating various opportunities to realise value.\nFinancial Review\nDuring the six-month period ended 31 August 2025, the Company recorded a loss for the period of US$ 727,268 (period ended 31 August 2024: profit of US$\n2,176,472\n). As at period end, cash and cash deposit balances stood at US$ 87,197 (28 February 2025: US$ 1,086,596), capitalised deferred mining, exploration, licence and permit costs stood at US$ 15,609,912 (28 February 2025: US$ 15,421,152), and total assets were US$ 16,004,701 as at 31 August 2025 (28 February 2025: US$\n16,779,135\n).\nPost period end, the Company entered into a short-term loan facility agreement for US$ 500,000 with Galloway Limited, a related party and significant shareholder. The funding was provided in connection with the undertaking made by\u00a0Galloway Limited\u00a0as noted in the audited statutory accounts for the year ending\u00a028 February 2025\u00a0to provide support for the Company to maintain its good standing and will be used for general working capital purposes.\nApproach to Risk and Corporate Governance\nThe Company's general risk appetite is a moderate, balanced one that allows it to maintain appropriate growth, profitability and scalability, whilst ensuring full corporate compliance. Bradda Head's risk appetite has been classified as high under an \"impact\" matrix defined as Zero, Low, Medium and High. Appropriate steps have been taken and adequate controls implemented to monitor the risks of the Company, and the appropriate committees and reporting structures have been established, which under the leadership of the Chair, will monitor risks facing the Company\n.\nThe Board of Bradda Head is committed to best practice in corporate governance throughout the Company. The Directors have agreed to comply with the provisions of the Quoted Companies Alliance (\"QCA\") Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies (2018) to the extent which is appropriate to its nature and scale of operations. Details of the Company's compliance with the QCA code can be found in the audited financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2025.\nStrategy and Outlook\nThe lithium market appears to have levelled off and stabilized while numerous mines in China ran into permitting issues that temporarily \"bumped\" prices of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. The global markets remain relatively stable with European countries continuing their \"buying-in\" mentality to reduction of carbon footprint through the purchasing of EV's but appear to be looking for cheaper models, some originating from China. USA-eligible EV's have seen an uptick in sales as tax credits and incentives came to an end on September 30. Battery storage maintains a steady pace throughout the minor fluctuations in EV sales, essentially carrying the lithium market through the dip. Battery storage is highly underrated and could carry the depressed EV sales through the next few years as it provides some states and regions of the world with intelligent energy storage to deal with climate fluctuations and occasional \"brown-outs\" from power facilities.\nRetail buyers and institutional investors remain on the lithium sidelines while heavily distracted by surging precious metal prices. Natural and logical M&A continues as does the transition of lithium explores to other commodities, whereas Bradda maintains the course and remains lithium centric.\nWhile the lithium prices have bottomed and incurred pressure on both explorers and suppliers, the demand for electrification across all industries has not diminished and steady growth will resume. This is also a time for M&A, which should filter-out lower quality projects and companies without capital, which places Bradda Head in a key position as we have conserved our treasury by trimming back expenditures while maintaining a strong and experienced team.\nJohn 'Ian' Stalker\nChair\n18 November 2025\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the period ended 31
