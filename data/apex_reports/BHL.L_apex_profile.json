It is a project that dovetails very nicely with our own San Domingo Project, also in Arizona, and, we believe, creates a much more substantial lithium pegmatite exploration/development opportunity for the Company in the USA.\nRio Tinto, through its US subsidiary, Kennecott Exploration, has undertaken a limited but very professional exploration program over the last two years or so that highlighted the opportunity at the Whistlejacket Project. Whilst not fitting into the \"Tier 1\" demands of Rio Tinto, it fits right into the wheelhouse of Bradda Head and complements the work done and knowledge gained by the Company at San Domingo. The distance between the Whistlejacket Project and the Basin Project is 11 kilometers and it is 80 kilometers to the San Domingo Project, so synergies between the projects are high and will enable the Company to leverage this position.\nOn 27 January 2026, the Company announced that it had entered in the Earn-in Agreement regarding the proposed Earn-in Acquisition. Further information regarding the Earn-in Acquisition is set out in in paragraph 4 below. Commencement of the Earn-in Acquisition pursuant to the Earn-in Agreement is subject only to the approval of Shareholders at the General Meeting.\nThe Company has been advised that the Earn-in Acquisition will not amount to a Reverse Transaction under the AIM Rules. However, given the size of the Earn-in Acquisition and the financial commitment required to develop the Whistlejacket Project the Company recognises that it is a sufficiently large enough commitment to be put to Shareholders for approval. To assist Shareholders in considering the proposal, the Company has had the CPR prepared which is summarised in paragraph\n5\nbelow and available on the Company's website. Furthermore, details of how the Company proposes to finance the Earn-in Acquisition are summarised in paragraph\n6\nbelow. Accordingly, the purpose of this document is to provide the background and technical overview of the Whistlejacket Project, provide an overview of the current assets and operations of the Enlarged Group, to explain the terms of the Earn-In Acquisition and to set out the reasons why your Board believes that the Earn-in Acquisition and the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole.\nConcurrent with the entering into of the Earn-In Agreement, Galloway Limited, a company owned by Director Jim Mellon, and Promaco Limited, a company owned by Director Ian Stalker, have agreed to provide the Company with convertible loans of US$1.025 million and US$0.25 million respectively to fund the costs of the Year One Commitment under the Earn-In Agreement ($750,000) and general working capital (the \"\nNew Facilities\n\"). The terms of the New Facilities are summarised in paragraph\n6\nbelow.\nShareholders should read this document in its entirety. In particular, you should consider carefully the \"Risk Factors\" set out in Part II of this document and the Competent Person's Report. Part IV of this document is the Notice of General Meeting\n.\n2\nINFORMATION ON THE COMPANY AND ITS EXISTING PROJECTS\nBradda Head is a North America-focused lithium development group. The Company currently has interests in a variety of projects, the most advanced of which are in Central and Western Arizona: The San Domingo Project, Basin Project, (Basin East Project, and the Basin West Project) and the Wikieup Project. The main focus to date has been on the Company's flagship pegmatite and sedimentary assets in Arizona, together with the Group's two prospective brine projects in Nevada and lithium brine assets in Pennsylvania and Texas. The Group also leverages its US based and experienced team led by Joey Wilkins (COO) to find new lithium projects and unlock value from our portfolio through continued land acquisition through claim staking or Arizona State Land leases and M&A within the US.\nThe Basin East Project has a Measured Mineral Resource of 20 Mt at an average grade of 929 ppm Li for a total of 99 kt LCE and an Indicated Mineral Resource of 122 Mt at an average grade of 860 ppm Li and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 499 Mt at an average grade of 810 ppm Li for a total of 2.81 Mt LCE. Whilst the immediate focus will be on Whistlejacket project, the Group intends, subject to the availability, of finance to continue developing its existing projects all of which are held on a 100 per cent equity basis and are in close proximity to the required infrastructure.\nA summary of the Group's Existing Projects is set out in Part III of this document.\n3\nBACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE EARN-IN ACQUISITION\nOur introduction to the Whistlejacket Project originates from a good relationship the Company has with Rio Tinto (Kennecott Exploration Company) from their original interest in the Company's own San Domingo Project. Rio Tinto reached out to the Company in November of 2024 to determine our interest in an undisclosed pegmatite project they discovered in Arizona. The Company signed an NDA and their data was shared with our technical team. Once the data was received and a site visit was completed, the Company saw the potential to discover a commercially viable lithium resource and requested a meeting with their commercial manager to discuss terms of acquisition.\nThe Whistlejacket Project is located only 11 kilometers southeast of the Company's Basin Project, 80 kilometers from the Company's San Domingo Project, and 3 kilometers south of the small mining town of Bagdad. Bagdad is also home to the Freeport McMoRan Bagdad porphyry copper-molybdenum open pit mine, which is useful for infrastructure and a pro-mining culture.\nThe Whistlejacket area had never previously been known to contain spodumene bearing pegmatites; thus, is a virgin discovery by Kennecott Exploration. All mineral rights to the property are on Arizona State Land Department lands and they control\n4\n,486.07 acres of state mineral rights referred to as MEP's or Mineral Exploration Permits. Once Kennecott obtained the mineral rights, they acquired an exploration permit, granting them rights to conduct surface exploration. Following that phase, they obtained a drilling permit and commenced drilling. They conducted two short programs of core drilling, identifying significant drill hole intercepts in several holes. Nearly every drill hole contains lithium mineralization, presenting an excellent opportunity to continue drilling and exploring with the intent of defining a maiden Mineral Resource.\nAs noted above, Bradda Head has several other projects of merit and will continue working on them as funds and time allow. Lithium bearing pegmatites are by far the most studied and well known for their simplicity in mining and processing, which is why the Company wishes to search and explore pegmatites, especially those in proximity to our San Domingo pegmatite project. The Whistlejacket Project is a perfect example of the kind of project Bradda Head is looking for to complement San Domingo and it has the characteristics that we believe makes it an excellent project for the Company.\nIn particular, the Board would highlight the following key details about the Whistlejacket Project which makes the Earn-in Acquisition particularly appealing:\n\u00b7\nAll 19 drill holes drilled for a total of 4,188 meters have encountered spodumene mineralization\n\u00b7\nHighlights from excellent drill hole intercepts are 19.47 meters at 1.65% Li2O in hole WSTL0008 and with 41 meters at 1.22% Li2O in hole WSTL0009\n\u00b7\nThere are many pegmatites on the property that have never been drilled and contain an abundance of spodumene and high lithium values, highlighting the opportunity for the Company\n\u00b7\nThe spodumene is mostly medium to coarse grained, an excellent characteristic of simple processing\n\u00b7\nThe project has an excellent dataset that includes surface mapping, geochemical sampling, airborne geophysics, and collected high resolution air photographs over much of the property\n\u00b7\nExcellent access, proximity to pavement, and the pro-mining town of Bagdad\n\u00b7\nSimple ASLD land to manage, explore, and potentially mine\n\u00b7\nThe geology of the pegmatites is classic LCT style with anomalous cesium and tantalum\n\u00b7\nThere are no environmental or social impediments, to our knowledge\nThe Company firmly believes this project has significant merit and has the potential to become an economic deposit and feasible for open pit mining. If that happens and the fact lithium is a critical metal, the Company believes it could be \"fast tracked\" for permitting by the State of Arizona.\n4\nPRINCIPAL TERMS OF THE EARN-IN ACQUISITION\nOn 26 January\n2026, the Company entered into the Earn-in Agreement with the Earn-in Partner, pursuant to which it has conditionally agreed to earn up to a 60 per cent interest in the Whistlejacket Project. The Earn-in Acquisition will be carried out in two phases and will come into effect in the event that Resolution 1 is passed at the General Meeting. A summary of the principal terms of the Earn-in Agreement is set out below.\nPhase One\nPhase One of the Earn-in Acquisition will occur over 3 years,\nconsisting of work expenditures of US$750,000, US$2,000,000, and US$2,750,000 in exploration activities per year over a 3-year period for a cumulative total of US$5,500,000 on the Whistlejacket property held by the Earn-in Partner upon completion of the Earn-in Agreement. Of the Phase One Commitment, only the Year One Commitment to spend US$750,000 is firmly committed by BHL. If BHL elects to terminate the Option prior to the first anniversary of the execution of the Definitive Agreement, or if BHL fails to timely satisfy the Phase One Commitment, the Company will pay to the Earn-in Partner in cash the difference between expenditures actually incurred and US$750,000. Upon completion of the requisite Phase One Commitment, the Company will acquire a 51 per cent interest in the Whistlejacket Project.\nFirst Buy-back Option\nNotwithstanding that completion of Phase One may have occurred, the Earn-in Partner will hold a buy-back option (the \"\nFirst Buy-Back Option\n\") for 90 days after the Company's exercise and completion of Phase One, which shall begin to run from the date the Company gives written notice and documentation of completion of Phase One and confirmation on whether the Company plans to proceed or not proceed with Phase Two, which the Earn-in Partner may exercise by paying to the Company an amount equal to two and one-half (2.5) times the amount of the Company's documented expenditures incurred to date to increase the Earn-in Partner's stake in the project back from 49% to 100%. Upon the Earn-in Partner's exercise of the First Buy-Back Option, the Earn-in Agreement will terminate and the Company will cease to have any interest in the Whistlejacket Project.\nPhase Two\nWithin thirty (30) days of exercise and completion of Phase One, the Company shall be required to provide written notice to the Earn-in Partner on whether the Company intends to proceed to Phase Two (subject to the First Buy-back Option being exercised). If the Company completes Phase One and does not elect to pursue Phase Two, and provided that the Earn-in Partner does not timely exercise the First Buy-back Option, a contractual joint venture arrangement will be established of which 51% shall be held by the Company and the remaining 49% shall be held by the Earn-in Partner.\nIn the event that the notice of intention to proceed to Phase Two is given and the First Buy-back Option is not exercised, Bradda Head may acquire an additional 9 per cent for a total of 60 per cent, by completing annual work expenditures of US$3,750,000, US$3,750,000, and US$4,500,000 per year over a second 3-year period for a cumulative Phase Two total of US$12,000,000.\nUpon completion of the requisite Phase Two expenditures, the Company will acquire a further 9 per cent interest in the Whistlejacket Project.\nSecond Buy-back Option\nNotwithstanding that completion of Phase Two may have occurred, the Earn-in Partner will hold a buy-back option (the \"\nSecond Buy-Back Option\n\") for 90 days after the Company's exercise and completion of Phase Two, which shall begin to run from the date the Company gives written notice and documentation of completion of Phase Two, which the Earn-in Partner may exercise by paying to the Company an amount equal to three (3) times the amount of the Company's documented expenditures incurred to date to increase the Earn-in Partner's stake in the project from 40% to 100%. Upon the Earn-in Partner's exercise of the Second Buy-Back Option, the Earn-in Agreement will terminate and the Earn-in Partner will own the Whistlejacket Project in full.\nApplicable Expenditures\nFor the purposes of contributing towards the Earn-in Acquisition, the following expenditures shall be included (\nApplicable Expenditures\n):\n\u00b7\nexploration (drilling, assays, geophysics),\n\u00b7\nenvironmental studies,\n\u00b7\npermitting,\n\u00b7\nresource calculation studies,\n\u00b7\nmetallurgical studies; and\n\u00b7\nsurveying and mapping (geological, geochemical and geophysical).\nThe Earn-in Partner shall have the right to audit the Applicable Expenditures.\nJoint Venture\nUpon completion of the Earn-in (and subject to the Earn-in Partner not exercising its buy-back options), the joint venture will proceed with weighted expenditures based upon percentage of ownership, 60% by the Company and 40% by the Earn-in Partner. A joint venture committee will be formed consisting of two people from the Company and two people from the Earn-in Partner. Work programs and expenditure budget proposals will be tabled on an annual basis to the joint venture committee for approval. If a joint venture partner is unwilling or unable to subsidize their share of the entire proposed budget, their ownership percentage will be reduced by standard and industry accepted reduction equations. If a joint venture partner's ownership falls below 10% due to inability to contribute to approved annual budgets and expenditures or to contribute to the cash calls within the deadline set by the manager, their ownership will be reduced to a 2.0% NSR (Net Smelter Royalty). The non-defaulting joint venture partner can provide cover payments for the default and subsequently can elect to adjust the ownership proportions based on initial contributions made in the joint venture partner's equity account. If the cover payment is repaid, there will be not be any adjustment made to the equity account or ownership share.\nPurchase option in favour of the Company\nOn completion of Phase One, the Company will have the option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent interest in the Whistlejacket Project still owned by the Earn-in Partner for US$7,500,000 (provided the Earn-in Partner does not exercise the First Buy-back Option). If the option is not exercised after completion of Phase One, but the Company proceeds with Phase Two of the earn-in, it shall have the option to acquire the remaining 40 per cent interest in the Whistlejacket Project still owned by the Earn-in Partner after completion of Phase Two for US$10,000,000. Exercise of either of the Company's purchase options shall at all times require the consent of the Earn-in Partner and if the Earn-in Partner agrees to proceed with such sale, they will also be granted a 1% net smelter royalty over the Whistlejacket Project.\nTermination rights\nThe Earn-in Acquisition may be terminated\n(and the obligation on the Company under the Earn-in Agreement shall cease without liability) at any time during the term of the Earn-in Agreement, except the first payment due under Phase One (US$0.75M) shall still be required to be paid as a minimum (to the extent not already paid). Termination thereafter, if desired and by either party, requires notification by email and letter and reciprocal confirmation of receipt. Any termination would require leaving license in good standing and no liabilities.\nManagement of the Whistlejacket Project\nNot later than 30 days after the entry into the Earn-in Agreement, the Parties will form a technical committee (the \"\nTechnical Committee\n\") comprised of four members, with two members appointed by each Party. The Technical Committee will govern the technical, logistical and budgetary matters applicable to the development of and operations on the Property until the formation of the Joint Venture, at a minimum of 51%/49% ownership. The Technical Committee will direct the operator with respect to the structure and requirements of any approved budget and program. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Technical Committee will constitute the decision and action of the Technical Committee. Failure to obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Technical Committee (including in the event of a deadlock) shall mean that a decision or action is not adopted. If no decision is made, the Technical Committee will negotiate at \"good will\" until an agreeable program is adopted. The Technical Committee will meet semi-annually in person or by telephone or videoconference, to review technical results, expenditures, status of tenements and any applications, work programs & budgets.\nThroughout the term of the Earn-in Agreement and thereafter, the Company's subsidiary Zenolith (USA) LLC will be the initial manager and operator of the Whistlejacket Project. The operator's duties shall include the adoption of a work programme and budget, maintenance of the Whistlejacket Project in good standing, maintain accounts and records for the Whistlejacket and provide the same to the Earn-in Partner, d\nevelop a rigid health and safety environment to prevent accidents and environmental incidents and conduct field activities, such as drilling and road construction, with highest BMP's (Best Management Practices).\nThe Company or the Earn-in Partner, whoever has a majority joint venture interest, will be solely responsible for the operation of the Whistlejacket Project. In consideration for acting as manager after the completion of the Earn-in, the manager shall be entitled to a management fee equal to 10% of the applicable expenditures during the exploration stage, 5.0% for all expenditures during the development stage, and 2.0% of all expenditures during the mining operation stage.\nGoverning law\nThe Earn-in Agreement and joint venture shall at all times be subject to Arizona law.\n5\ncpr SUMMARY INFORMATION ON THE WHISTLEJACKET PROJECT\nLocation and Geography\nThe Whistlejacket Project is located in Yavapai County, Arizona. It located immediately south of the town of Bagdad, the site of the Bagdad copper mine owned by Freeport Copper Corporation. The approximate centre of the property is located at UTM 300000 E, 3825000N (NAD83, Zone 12). The project is readily accessed via US Highway 93 from Wickenburg and then State Highways 97 and 96. Access to the property claims is via a network of gravel roads and trails. The majority of the property is accessible by 4WD vehicles. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the property.\nLicences comprising the Whistlejacket Project\nThe Whistlejacket Project is held as a series of Mineral Exploration Permits (MEPs) registered in the name of Kennecott Exploration Company (\"Kennecott\"), a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto Exploration (RTX) manages the permits on behalf of Kennecott (and ultimately Rio Tinto). All of the MEPs are reported to be in good standing as of the date of this document and as detailed below.\nMEPs must be renewed annually for a period of up to a maximum of five years, at which time they statutorily expire. If renewal is required after the five year period, the applicant must apply for a new MEP prior to the end of the statutory expiration date.\nAnnual renewal fees are US$500/application, plus US$ 1.00/acre annual rent. In addition, annual renewals require submission of an affidavit and documentation to the ADSL confirming the required exploration expenditures, or alternatively, payment in lieu thereof of US$ 10/acre for the first two annual periods (after the first year) and US$ 20/acre for the remaining two annual periods, and $US 20/acre for any renewal in subsequent years. Finally, MEP holders are required to maintain certain insurance coverages. The available data indicate all required annual fees have been paid and receipted (or payment is being processed by the ADSL) and that the required liability insurance coverage is in place as approved by the ADSL on July 15, 2025. Details of the Annual Fees and Expenditures are fully set out in Table 3 of the CPR.\nProposed\nExploration Budget - Year 1 of Option Agreement\nBradda Head Limited has proposed an exploration budget for the initial year of exploration under the terms of the option agreement as detailed in Table ES-1 contained in the CPR and set out below. The author of the CPR has reviewed this budget in consultation with senior BHL staff and considers the proposed exploration program and budget to be reasonable.\nActivities undertaken to date\nRio Tinto has undertaken preliminary exploration on the property, including drilling and mineralogical evaluation. 19 drill holes have been completed for a total of 4,188 m. No resource estimate has been prepared as of the date of this CPR.\nExploration work to date has identified a series of pegmatite dykes containing spodumene as the principal lithium-bearing mineral. The pegmatites are generally oriented in a SW-NE strike direction, with some oriented in an E-W or N-S direction. The pegmatites intrude the mafic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks of the Bridle Formation and dip from sub-horizontal to sub-vertical. The pegmatites form swarms or clusters, of which seven have been tested by drilling and/or surface sampling. A significant N-S oriented volcanic tuff zone separates the Bridle Formation rocks and the pegmatites into two zones, with the eastern side predominating in terms of the number of pegmatite showings.\nExploration results by RTX demonstrated the sampled pegmatites contained relatively medium to coarse-grained spodumene grading approximately 1.1% - 1.2% Li2O and that dense media separation (DMS) could potentially produce a commercial quality (5.5% - 6.0% Li2O) concentrate. Core assay results show lithium hydroxide mineralization in all 19 holes, including 41.0 meters at 1.22% Li2O in hole WSTL0009 and 19.47 meters at 1.65% Li2O in hole WSTL0008\nDescription of Resources and Reserves\nNo mineral resources or mineral reserves are reported in this CPR. An exploration target has been defined for between 12 M tonnes to 15 M tonnes grading between 0.7% to 1.1% Li2O. Results from the core drilling, surface geochemistry and geological mapping show potential to expand the pegmatite mineralization laterally and at depth, whilst many pegmatites have not been drill tested and contain several rock chip samples at >2.0% Li2O.\nConclusions\nIn general, the exploration results to date have been positive in identifying a prospective spodumene deposit. Additional work is justified to better delineate the resource potential of the Whistlejacket project area and better understand the potential economics of developing the project. Future exploration programs are expected to comprise a range of exploration techniques, with a focus on surface mapping and sampling, trenching, drilling, geophysical surveys, and mineralogical and metallurgical test work.\nIn the opinion of the Qualified Person for this CPR the available exploration data are sufficient to support an \"exploration target\" as such is defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (\"CIM\") mineral resource and mineral reserve definitions, of between 12 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes mineralization grading between 0.7% Li2O to 1.1% Li2O.\nExploration efforts should focus on additional surface mapping and sampling to identify additional pegmatites and their orientation; structural analysis to better understand the relationship between the sub-horizontal and sub-vertical pegmatite swarms, and follow-up drilling to develop the data necessary for a resource estimate. Additional mineralogical and metallurgical test work to assess the potential for DMS processing of the spodumene is also required.\n6\nCURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION AND FUNDING OF THE ENLARGED GROUP\nAs announced by the Company on 25 September 2025, the Company entered into a short-term loan facility agreement (\"\nExisting Galloway Facility\n\") with Galloway Limited, a related party. The funding was provided in connection with the undertaking made by Galloway Limited as noted in the statutory accounts for the year ending 28 February 2025 to provide support for the Company to maintain its good standing and will be used for general working capital purposes. The Existing Galloway Facility was for US$500,000 and has been drawn in full. Accordingly, as at 31 December 2025, the Company has existing cash balances of US$54,000.\nIn order to fund the Year One Commitment, the Company has entered into new convertible facility agreements with each of Galloway Limited, a company owned by Jim Mellon, and Promaco Limited (a company owned by Ian Stalker) pursuant to which Galloway Limited and Promaco Limited will provide an unsecured convertible loans in the amount of US$1,025,000 (\"\nNew Galloway Facility\n\") and US$250,000 (\"\nPromaco Loan Facility\n\") respectively (together the \"\nNew Facilities\n\"). The New Facilities are subject to equivalent terms and shall accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum of the principal amount outstanding. It is intended that the Existing Galloway Facility will be rolled into the New Loan Facility such that the total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness owing to Galloway under these arrangements shall be US$1,525,000 (\"\nTotal Galloway Loan Amounts\n\"), and that such amounts shall be capable of conversion into Ordinary Shares.\nThe Company shall repay the Total Galloway Loan Amounts and the Promaco Loan Facility on the earlier of (i) the date on which the parties agree that the Total Galloway Loan Amounts and the Promaco Loan Facility shall be repaid, (ii)the 2nd anniversary of the drawdown of the New Facilities (or such later date as may be agreed in writing between the Company and each of Galloway Limited and Promaco Limited, and (iii) on the occurrence of an event of default (in line with industry norms). The Total Galloway Loan Amounts and the Promaco Loan Facility shall be automatically converted into Ordinary Shares upon the completion of a qualifying fundraise of not less than \u00a32 million (gross) carried out by the Company, in which case the conversion price shall be at a 10% discount to the amount paid by each investor in the qualifying fundraise.\nGalloway Limited and Promaco Limited shall each have the option to convert some or all of the Total Galloway Loan Amount and/or the Promaco Loan Facility (together with all accrued but unpaid interest) into Ordinary Shares in the Company by issuing a conversion notice under the convertible loan agreements. In such circumstance, the conversion will take place at a price per share equal to a 10% discount to 30 day volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares as at the close of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the date of issue of a conversion notice.\nThe provision of funding pursuant to the New Loan Facilities, as well as the existing cash balances held as set out above, means that the Company is able to meet its firm obligations under the Earn-in Agreement and to fund the operations of the Company in the short term.\nIt should be noted that at this stage the Company does not have funding for the Whistlejacket Project beyond the first year of Phase One and will need to raise finance in the form for equity or debt or possible direct participation in this and/or other of its projects to fund the future years of the Whistlejacket Project.\nAIM Rule 13\nGallloway Limited is a company indirectly wholly owned by Jim Mellon, and which is the Company's largest shareholder. Denham Eke is also the Managing Director of Galloway Limited. Promaco Limited is indirectly wholly owned by John Ian Stalker, the Executive Chair of the Company. Accordingly, the provision of the New Loan Facilities (including the roll up of the Existing Galloway Facility into the New Loan Facility) are related party transactions under the AIM Rules. Accordingly, the independent director, being Alex Borrelli and Euan Jenkins, having consulted with the Group's Nominated Adviser, consider that the terms of the New Facilities are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIn forming this view the independent directors have noted the following:\n\u00b7\nthe minimum US$750,000 commitment of the Company over the next 12 months (should the Proposed Transaction be approved by shareholders);\n\u00b7\nthe Board's support for the Proposed Transaction and the potential benefit the Board believes this will provide all Bradda shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe need to satisfy KEX that the Company has capital to meet the guaranteed expenditure prior to signing the Agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe current cash position of the Company and the amounts due under the existing loan facilities provided by Galloway;\n\u00b7\nthe need for the Company to complete a Qualifying Fundraise within the next 12 months, providing\n\u00b7\ncapital to meet expenditure commitments in year two (and potentially beyond) under the Agreement;\n\u00b7\nplanned continued expenditure of the Company on its existing assets over the next 12 months as well as general working capital requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe unsecured nature of the CLN Facility;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of alternative short-term bridge finance to satisfy KEX and prior to a Qualifying Fundraise; and\n\u00b7\nthe positive market message of Galloway Limited, the Company's largest shareholder, and Promaco Limited, being wholly owned by the Executive Chair of Bradda Head, providing further financial support to support management.\nShareholder approval\nThe Conversion of the Total Galloway Amounts gives rise to certain considerations under the Company's Articles. As a BVI company, the Company is not subject to the UK Takeover Code. However, Regulation 24 of the Articles sets out provisions regulating takeover offers in respect of the Company. In particular, Regulation 24.2(a) provides that a person must not, whether by himself or with persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him, acquire an interest in shares which, taken together with shares in which persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him have become interested, carry 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights attributable to all the shares of the Company, except as a result of a \"\nPermitted Acquisition\n\". A \"\nPermitted Acquisition\n\" would either be (i) an acquisition approved by Shareholders (excluding any Shareholder carrying out the acquisition together with all persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him) or (ii) an acquisition carried out in accordance with Rule 9 of the UK Takeover Code (as if such provision applied to the Company), whereby an offer would need to be made to Shareholders.\nUnder the Convertible Loan Agreements, a conversion notice shall not be capable of being served if as a result of the conversion pursuant to that conversion notice, the lender (being either Galloway Limited or Promaco Limited), together with persons with which they are acting in concert, would as a result of the conversion, hold 30% or more of the issued Ordinary Shares of the Company unless such issuance of Ordinary Shares would constitute a \"Permitted Acquisition\" (the \"\nConversion Condition\n\").\nIt is not expected that the conversion of the Promaco Loan Facility into Ordinary Shares will cause Promaco Limited, together with any parties acting in concert with them (being the IS Concert Party), to hold 30% or more of the Ordinary Shares in issue. However, as the largest shareholder in the Company, there is a possibility that the conversion of the Total Galloway Loan Amounts could cause the shareholding of Galloway Limited, together with parties acting in concert with Galloway Limited (being the JM Concert Party), to reach 30% or more of the Ordinary Shares. As the conversion amount is not fixed and remains subject to determination at the time of conversion, this cannot be known for sure at this time. Accordingly, it is proposed that the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreements be approved by the Independent Shareholders in the General Meeting for the purposes of Regulation 24.1(e)(i) and Regulation 24.2(a) of the Articles such that the conversion of the Total Galloway Amounts and the Promaco Loan Facility shall not cause any requirement for an offer to be made to Shareholders under Regulation 24 of the Articles.\n7\nRISK FACTORS\nShareholders and other prospective investors in the Company should be aware that an investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk. Your attention is drawn to the risk factors set out in Part II of this document.\n8\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nIn the year to 31 December 2024, the Earn-in Partner spent approximately $51,000 on the Whistlejacket Project with the material assets being the MEP's over the project. Other than the commitments pursuant to the Earn-in Agreement, there are no material liabilities connected with the Whistlejacket Project.\nShareholders should read the whole of this document, which provides additional information on the Company, the Whistlejacket Project and the Proposals, and should not rely on summaries of, or individual parts only of, this document. Your attention is drawn, in particular, to Parts II and III of this document.\n9\nGENERAL MEETING\nYou will find set out at the\nend of this document a notice convening the General Meeting of the Company to be held at 4.00 p.m. on\n17 February 2026 at\nThe Claremont Hotel, 18-22 Loch Promenade, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 2LX\nat which the following Resolutions will be proposed:\nResolution 1: To approve the Earn-in Acquisition. Resolution 1 shall be proposed as an ordinary resolution and all Shareholders shall be entitled to vote in respect thereof.\nResolution 2: To approve the issue of Ordinary Shares to Galloway Limited and Promaco Limited pursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreements for the purposes of Regulation 24.1(e) and Regulation 24.2(a) of the Articles. Resolution 2 shall be proposed as an ordinary resolution to be taken on a poll of Independent Shareholders only.\n10\nACTION TO BE TAKEN\nA Form of Proxy and a Form of Instruction for use at the General Meeting are enclosed with this Document.\nShareholders holding Ordinary Shares in certificated form should complete and sign the Form of Proxy and return it to Computershare Investor Services (Jersey) Limited,\nc/o Computershare Investor Services PLC\n, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY; to be received not later than\n4.00 p.m.\non 13 February 2026 or 48 hours before any adjourned meeting.\nDepositary Interest holders should complete and sign the Form of Instruction and return it to Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY; to be received not later than 4.00 p.m. on 12 February 2026 or 72 hours before any adjourned meeting.\nThe return of a Form of Proxy or Form of Instruction will not, however, prevent a Shareholder from attending the Meeting of Shareholders and voting in person, should he/she wish to do so. Shareholders who wish to attend in person should contact Computershare Investor Services PLC in advance to confirm what identity documents they should bring with them and to complete a form of representation (available on request from Computershare Investor Services PLC) if necessary.\n11\nRECOMMENDATION\nThe Board is of the opinion that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution 1, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings, which amount in aggregate to 79,633,714 Existing Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 20.39 per cent. of the Existing Ordinary Shares. Additionally, the Independent Directors unanimously recommend that the Independent Shareholders vote in favour of Resolution 2, as the Independent Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings, which amount in aggregate to 2,666,570 Existing Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 0.68 per cent. of the Existing Ordinary Shares.\nYours faithfully\nIan Stalker\nExecutive Chairman\nAppendix II\nDefined Terms and Glossary of Technical Terms\nDEFINITIONS\nThe following definitions apply throughout this document unless the context otherwise requires:\n\"AIM\"\nthe market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange;\n\"AIM Rules\"\nthe AIM Rules for Companies and the AIM Rules for Nominated\nAdvisers;\n\"AIM Rules for Companies\"\nthe rules which set out the obligations and responsibilities in relation to companies whose shares are admitted to AIM as published by the London Stock Exchange from time to time;\n\"AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers\"\nthe rules which set out the eligibility, obligations and certain disciplinary matters in relation to nominated advisers as published by the London Stock Exchange from time to time;\n\"Articles\"\nthe memorandum and articles of association of the Company for the time being;\n\"Board\" or \"Directors\"\nthe current directors of the Company, whose names are set out on\npage 4 of this document;\n\"BVI\"\nthe British Virgin Islands;\n\"Certificated\" or \"in Certificated\nForm\"\na share or other security recorded on the relevant register of the\nrelevant company as being held in certificated form and title to which\nmay be transferred by means of a stock transfer form;\n\"Company\"\nBradda Head Lithium Limited, a company incorporated and registered in the BVI\nwith registration number 1553975;\n\"Competent Person\"\nMeans\nHains Engineering Company Limited\n;\n\"Competent Person's Report\" or \"CPR\"\nmeans the independent technical report prepared by the Competent Person for the Company in relation to the Whistlejacket Project as summarised in paragraph\n5\nof Part I of this document and published on the Company's website;\n\"Connected Persons\"\nhas the meaning set out in the UK Takeover Code and includes a spouse, children under 18 and any company in which the relevant person is interested in shares comprising at least one-fifth of the share capital of that company;\n\"Convertible Loan Agreements\"\nthe convertible loan agreements entered into on or around the date of this circular by the Company with each of Galloway Limited and Promaco Limited pursuant to which the New Facilities are made available to the Company;\n\"CREST\"\nthe computerized settlement system to facilitate the transfer of title of shares in uncertificated form operated by Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited;\n\"CREST Regulations\"\nthe Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (SI 2001 No. 3755), as amended;\n\"Depositary\"\nComputershare Investor Services PLC of The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS13 8AE;\n\"Depositary Interests\" or \"DIs\"\nthe interests representing Ordinary Shares issued through the Depositary\n\"Earn-in Acquisition\"\nthe earn-in acquisition by the Company of up to 60 per cent.

Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered..\n\"Inferred Mineral Resource\"\nthe part of a mineral deposit for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence that that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resources and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.\n\"LCE\"\nlithium carbonate equivalent.\n\"Li2O\"\nor\n\"Li2O\"\nlithium oxide - a unit of grade commonly used for hard rock lithium deposits.\n\"lithium carbonate equivalent\" or \"LCE\"\na method of expressing lithium content in terms of lithium carbonate equivalent, which is a form of lithium that is commonly traded.\n\"magnetotelluric or MT\"\na\ntype of electro-magnetic geophysical survey for determining differences in conductivity of geological formations hundreds of metres below the surface\n.\n\"MEP\"\nMineral Exploration Permit granted by the Arizona State Land Department (ASLD) allowing access to mineral rights over 5 year periods, renewable with right of first refusal after 5 years and as long as the Company maintains required payments and/or expenditures.\n\"metallurgical\"\npertaining to\nlaboratory testwork, undertaken to determine the most appropriate process route for the economic recovery of valuable minerals/metals\n.\n\"Measured Mineral Resource\"\nThat part of a Mineral Resource for which mineralization or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a Measured Mineral Resource when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade or quality of the mineralization can be estimated to within close limits and that variation from the estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability of the deposit.

A copy of the circular together with an accompanying CPR (prepared by Hains Engineering Company Limited) will be available on the Company's website -\nwww.braddaheadltd.com\n. A further announcement will be made when the circular is posted with details of the General Meeting to be held.\nHighlights\n\u2022\nOption in Phase 1 to earn-in and acquire 51% followed by an Option in Phase 2, at the discretion of BHL, to earn-in and acquire an additional 9% for a total of 60% of the Whistlejacket Project\n\u2022\nClearly defined phases, project milestones and expenditure requirements incentivizing development of the asset\n\u2022\nAt the end of each phase of the earn-in, KEX will have an option to reacquire the interests in the Project earned by the Company at a multiple of the expenditures made by the Company, and if such option is not exercised, the Company shall have the option to acquire all remaining interests in the Project held by the KEX\n\u2022\nWhistlejacket Project consists of 9 state MEP's (Arizona State Lands Department Mineral Exploration Permits) for a total size of 4,486.07 acres, complementary to Bradda's existing portfolio\n\u2022\nKEX conducted exploration drilling on spodumene bearing pegmatites, completing a total of 19 holes for a total of 4,188 meters of core with assay results showing lithium hydroxide mineralization in all holes, including 41.0 meters at 1.22% Li2O in hole WSTL0009 and 19.47 meters at 1.65% Li2O in hole WSTL0008\n\u2022\nKEX has also conducted surface mapping, sampling, airborne geophysics, and collected high resolution air photos over much of the property, greatly enhancing its value\n\u2022\nNo mineral resource on the Whistlejacket property has been calculated by KEX\n\u2022\nResults from the core drilling, surface geochemistry and geological mapping show potential to expand the pegmatite mineralization laterally and at depth, whilst many pegmatites have not been drill tested and contain several rock chip samples at >2.0% Li2O\n\u2022\nSufficient due diligence has been undertaken on exploration dataset in addition to the land tenure with no technical issues being identified\n\u2022\nThe property has year-round access to road infrastructure throughout, technical personnel/services and accommodation in the nearby towns of Wickenburg or Prescott, Arizona\n\u2022\nThe Project is 140 km northwest of the state capital, Phoenix, 11 km from the Company's existing Basin asset, 80 km from San Domingo, and is 3 km away from the operational Bagdad porphyry copper-molybdenum mine operated by Freeport McMoRan.\nProposed Transaction subject to Shareholder Approval\nThe Proposed Transaction does not constitute a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, but in the interests of good governance, and in consultation with the Company's nominated adviser, under the terms of the Agreement the Proposed Transaction is subject to approval of the Company's shareholders. The Company will shortly publish a circular including a notice of general meeting (the \"\nCircular\n\"), convening a meeting of shareholder to be held (the \"\nMeeting\n\"). Details of arrangements for the Meeting will be set out in is the Circular which will be available on the Company's website at\nhttps://www.braddaheadltd.com/investors#ShareholderDocuments\n.\nIn addition to the notice of Meeting, the Circular will include a summary of the Company's current assets, details of the proposed work programme and budget for the earn-in, funding arrangements entered into as well as a recommendation as to why the Directors of the Company unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favour of the Proposed Transaction. The Circular will also include summary information from a comprehensive technical report constituting a Competent Person's Report under the AIM Rules, as well as Risk Factors and other information the Company considers relevant for a shareholder in making a decision whether to approve the Proposed Transaction. The full Competent Person's Report is available on the Company's website at\nhttps://www.braddaheadltd.com/investors#TechnicalReports\n.\nIan Stalker, Executive Chair and Director commented:\n\"Subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming general meeting, the Whistlejacket Project will be a fabulous acquisition for the Company which we are excited to add to our lithium portfolio and plan on commencing exploration as soon as possible. The project has excellent access in a great jurisdiction on state land, close to both our Basin and San Domingo projects, and has the potential to become a significant asset to the Company. Our partners at Whistlejacket are part of one of the leading international mining companies and we are delighted that they have chosen Bradda Head to drive forward the exploration and potential development of the Whistlejacket Project.\n\"The acquisition of Whistlejacket fits exceptionally well with the Company's exploration model and advancements over the past three years at San Domingo, a mere 80 km to the southeast. Subject to completion of the acquisition, all exploration dollars allocated towards Whistlejacket will go directly into the ground as the Company is planning an aggressive drilling program in the near future, once additional surface sampling and mapping are completed. The potential at Whistlejacket starts with a dedicated and experienced team that will deliver the best results possible through strategic drill testing of existing and new targets. Further information on the targets and planning will be provided in due course.\n\"The work conducted to date by KEX is of the highest standard, utilizing Best Management Practices and provides Bradda Head with an exceptional foundation to leverage our strategic and future drill planning. The extensive data collected demonstrates positive aspects for crushing and ore processing. Furthermore, and examining potential synergies, our metallurgical studies previously conducted on San Domingo drill core composites determined significant cost savings through AI assisted mineral ore sorting upgrades and provide the Company with optimism that a path to production is possible, initially at San Domingo and then Whistlejacket.\"\nEarn-in Expenditure; Convertible Loan Agreements (\"CLAs\").\nDuring the course of the earn-in, the Company will need to meet minimum expenditure and work programme milestones to acquire its interest in the Whistlejacket Project. In particular the Company will incur expenditure of not less than US$ 750,000 in the first year following approval of the Agreement (such date being the \"Completion Date\"), and up to a total of US$ 5.5 million in the first three years following the Completion Date if the Company wants to acquire the initial 51% interest. To take the Company's interest to 60% the Company will need to incur expenditures of a further US$ 12 million over a further 3-year period (US$ 3.75 million in year 4, US$ 3.75 million in year 5, and US$ 4.5 million in year 6).\nAs at the date of the Agreement the Company does not have all of the capital required to meet its earn-in commitment in Year 1 (which is guaranteed by Bradda), and to cover expenditure in the first three years following the Completion Date, required to acquire the 51% interest in the Whistlejacket Project.\nAs a bridging support facility, the Company has agreed the terms for convertible loan facilities to be made available to it by Galloway Limited (\"Galloway\") and Promaco Limited (\"Promaco\").\nGalloway is a company indirectly wholly owned by Jim Mellon, a Director of the Company, and which is the Company's largest shareholder. Promaco is indirectly wholly owned by John Ian Stalker, the Executive Chair of the Company. Under the terms of the CLAs, Galloway and Promaco will be investing US$ 1,025,000 and US$ 250,000 respectively, resulting in a total of US$ 1,275,000 in the Company (in addition to amounts already provided under the existing Galloway Facility as set out below).\nThe size of the facilities can be increased with the written agreement of Galloway and Promaco. As announced on 25 September 2025, Galloway made a US$ 500,000 facility available to the Company to support its working capital. All sums drawn under that existing loan facility, including interest thereon, shall be applied to the CLA entered into with Galloway. At the date of this Announcement, a total of US$ 500,000 has been advanced by Galloway under the existing Galloway Facility and the total principal amount subject to the CLA entered into with Galloway shall be US$ 1,525,000.\nThe terms of the CLAs are set out below:\n\u00b7\nUnsecured 24-month facility (expiry being the \"Maturity Date\");\n\u00b7\nrepaid amounts may not be redrawn;\n\u00b7\nThe outstanding balance of the CLAs (including interest) may be converted into new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at any time at the option of the lender;\n\u00b7\nThe amounts outstanding pursuant to the CLAs (including interest) will automatically convert into new Ordinary Shares concurrent with an equity financing by the Company to raise not less than \u00a32 million (gross) prior to the Maturity Date (a Qualifying Fundraise\");\n\u00b7\nConversion Price equal to 90% of the 30-day volume weighted average price at close of trading on the last trading day prior to the date notice to convert the CLAs is proposed, if converted at the election of the lender, or a price equal to 90% of the price paid by investors participating in the Qualifying Fundraise;\n\u00b7\nAmounts outstanding under the CLAs carry a 10% annual coupon, accruing monthly.\nConversion of CLAs subject to Shareholder Approval\nThe conversion of the amounts outstanding under the CLAs gives rise to certain considerations under the Company's memorandum and articles of association (\"Articles\"). As a BVI company, the Company is not subject to the UK Takeover Code. However, Regulation 24 of the Articles sets out provisions regulating takeover offers in respect of the Company. In particular, Regulation 24.2(a) provides that a person must not, whether by himself or with persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him, acquire an interest in shares which, taken together with shares in which persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him have become interested, carry 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights attributable to all the shares of the Company, except as a result of a \"Permitted Acquisition\". A \"Permitted Acquisition\" would either be (i) an acquisition approved by Shareholders (excluding any Shareholder carrying out the acquisition together with all persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him) or (ii) an acquisition carried out in accordance with Rule 9 of the UK Takeover Code (as if such provision applied to the Company), whereby an offer would need to be made to Shareholders.\nUnder the CLAs, a conversion notice shall not be capable of being served if as a result of the conversion pursuant to that conversion notice, the lender (being either Galloway or Promaco), together with persons with which they are acting in concert, would as a result of the conversion, hold 30% or more of the issued Ordinary Shares of the Company unless such issuance of Ordinary Shares would constitute a \"Permitted Acquisition\" (the \"Conversion Condition\").\nIt is not expected that the conversion of the Promaco CLA into Ordinary Shares will cause Promaco, together with any parties acting in concert with them, to hold 30% or more of the Ordinary Shares in issue. However, as the largest shareholder in the Company, there is a possibility that the conversion of the Galloway CLA could cause the shareholding of Galloway, together with parties acting in concert with Galloway, to reach 30% or more of the Ordinary Shares. As the conversion amount is not fixed and remains subject to determination at the time of conversion, this cannot be known for sure at this time. Accordingly, it is proposed that the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the CLAs be approved by the Shareholders independent of Galloway and Promaco (and their respective concert parties) in the Meeting for the purposes of Regulation 24.1(e)(i) and Regulation 24.2(a) of the Articles such that the conversion of the CLAs shall not cause any requirement for an offer to be made to Shareholders under Regulation 24 of the Articles.\nAIM Rule 13\nAs Jim Mellon and Denham Eke are both directors of the Company, and Jim Mellon is the 100% beneficial owner of Galloway Limited and Denham Eke its Managing Director, and John Ian Stalker, the Company's Chair, is the 100% beneficial owner of Promaco Limited, the provision of the CLAs is a Related Party Transaction under the AIM Rules. Accordingly, the independent directors, being Alex Borrelli and Euan Jenkins, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, consider that the terms of the CLAs are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned. In forming this view the independent directors have noted the following:\n- the minimum US$ 750,000 commitment of the Company over the next 12 months (should the Proposed Transaction be approved by shareholders);\n- the Board's support for the Proposed Transaction and the potential benefit the Board believes this will provide all Bradda shareholders;\n- the need to satisfy KEX that the Company has capital to meet the guaranteed expenditure prior to signing the Agreement;\n- the current cash position of the Company and the amounts due under the existing loan facilities provided by Galloway;\n- the need for the Company to complete a Qualifying Fundraise within the next 12 months, providing\ncapital to meet expenditure commitments in year two (and potentially beyond) under the Agreement;\n- planned continued expenditure of the Company on its existing assets over the next 12 months as well as general working capital requirements;\n- the unsecured nature of the CLAs;\n- the cost of alternative short-term bridge finance to satisfy KEX and prior to a Qualifying Fundraise; and\n- the positive market message of Galloway Limited, the Company's largest shareholder, and Promaco Limited, being wholly owned by the Executive Chair of Bradda Head, providing further financial support to support management.\nFurther Information Regarding the Option to Joint Venture Agreement\nPhase 1 Expenditure Requirements, Schedule and Project Milestones\n\u00b7\nFollowing agreement of shareholders, BHL will initiate Phase 1 exploration over a 3-year period with annual expenditures of\no\nUS$ 0.75 million (guaranteed expenditure) in year 1, focused on exploration;\no\nUS$ 2.0 million in year 2 on exploration, studies and permitting; and\no\nUS$ 2.75 million in year 3 on exploration, studies and permitting\nfor a total of US$ 5.5 million, which earns BHL a 51% in the Project and 49% ownership with KEX and an option to form a joint venture\n\u00b7\nWithin 90 days of completion of Phase 1, KEX will have the ability to buy back the interests in the Project from the Company. The acquisition consideration would be 2.5 times the documented expenditures by the Company to earn its interests in the Project.\n\u00b7\nIn the event that KEX does not exercise its right to buy back the interests in the Project from the Company, BHL may then choose to proceed to Phase 2 or otherwise for an incorporated joint venture to be formed with it as the 51% shareholder.\nFormation of the Technical Committee\nUpon commencement of Phase 1, BHL and KEX will form a technical committee comprised of two representatives from each party (the \"Technical Committee\"). The Technical Committee will govern the technical, logistical and budgetary matters applicable to the development of and operations on the Property until the formation of the joint venture, at a minimum of 51%/49% ownership. The Technical Committee will direct the operator with respect to the structure and requirements of any approved budget and program. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Technical Committee will constitute the decision and action of the Technical Committee. Failure to obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Technical Committee (including in the event of a deadlock) shall mean that a decision or action is not adopted. If no decision is made, the Technical Committee will negotiate in \"good faith\" until an agreeable program is adopted. The Technical Committee will meet semi-annually to review technical results, expenditures, status of tenements and any applications, work programs and budgets.\nThroughout the term of the Agreement and thereafter, BHL's subsidiary Zenolith (USA) LLC will be responsible for appointing the initial manager and operator of the Whistlejacket Project. The operator's duties shall include the adoption of a work programme and budget, maintenance of the Whistlejacket Project in good standing, maintain accounts and records for the Whistlejacket and provide the same to the KEX, develop a rigid health and safety environment to prevent accidents and environmental incidents and conduct field activities, such as drilling and road construction, with highest BMP's (Best Management Practices).\nOption to Proceed to Phase 2\nWithin 30 days of completion of Phase 1, BHL has the option to proceed to Phase 2 or can remain at 51%. If proceeding to Phase 2 it may earn into an additional 9% interest in the Project, on the following terms:\n\u00b7\nPhase 2, Year 4, expenditures of US$ 3.75 million in exploration, studies, and permitting\n\u00b7\nPhase 2, Year 5, expenditures of US$ 3.75 million in exploration, studies, and permitting\n\u00b7\nPhase 2, Year 6, expenditures of US$ 4.50 million in exploration, studies, and permitting\nAt the conclusion of Phase 2, cumulative expenditures in Phase 1 and 2 are expected to meet or exceed US$ 17 million, with Phase 2 expenditure giving BHL an additional 9% ownership and interest and bringing total ownership to 60%, with KEX owning the remaining 40% in the Whistlejacket Project. Formation of a joint venture between BHL and KEX to immediately follow completion of Phase 2.\u00a0Within 90 days of completion of Phase 2, KEX will have the ability to buy back the interests in the Project from the Company. The acquisition consideration would be 3x the documented expenditures by the Company to earn its interests in the Project.\nUpon completion of Phase 2 (and subject to the KEX not exercising its buyback options), the joint venture will proceed with weighted expenditures based upon percentage of ownership, 60% by BHL and 40% by KEX. A joint venture committee will be formed consisting of two representatives from each company. Work programs and expenditure budget proposals will be tabled on an annual basis to the joint venture committee for approval. If either company is unwilling or unable to subsidize their share of the entire proposed budget, their ownership percentage will be reduced by standard and industry accepted reduction equations.\nNet Smelter Royalty (\"NSR\")\nIf either company fails to contribute to the joint venture and their share of the new company falls below 10%, their ownership is reduced to a 2.0% NSR.\nBHL option to acquire KEX's retained interests in the Whistlejacket Project\nBHL has the option to purchase KEX's 49% interest in the Project upon completion of Phase 1, but only at the discretion of KEX. The purchase price following completion of Phase 1 would be US$ 7.5 million. Similarly, after completion of Phase 2, BHL has the option to purchase KEX's remaining 40% for US$ 10 million, at the discretion of KEX. KEX would retain a 1.0% NSR if either purchase is executed by BHL.\nExpenditure to date by KEX\nTo the date of this transaction, KEX has incurred the following costs on the Whistlejacket project:\n- Last 12 months total costs of US$ 51,100 which have all been expensed; and\n- Total spend of US$ 5,485,275, of which 100% has been expensed.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU No. 596/2014) AS IT FORMS PART OF\u00a0UK\u00a0DOMESTIC LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE\u00a0EUROPEAN UNION\u00a0(WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018.
