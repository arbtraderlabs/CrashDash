A copy of the circular together with an accompanying CPR (prepared by Hains Engineering Company Limited) will be available on the Company's website -\nwww.braddaheadltd.com\n. A further announcement will be made when the circular is posted with details of the General Meeting to be held.\nHighlights\n\u2022\nOption in Phase 1 to earn-in and acquire 51% followed by an Option in Phase 2, at the discretion of BHL, to earn-in and acquire an additional 9% for a total of 60% of the Whistlejacket Project\n\u2022\nClearly defined phases, project milestones and expenditure requirements incentivizing development of the asset\n\u2022\nAt the end of each phase of the earn-in, KEX will have an option to reacquire the interests in the Project earned by the Company at a multiple of the expenditures made by the Company, and if such option is not exercised, the Company shall have the option to acquire all remaining interests in the Project held by the KEX\n\u2022\nWhistlejacket Project consists of 9 state MEP's (Arizona State Lands Department Mineral Exploration Permits) for a total size of 4,486.07 acres, complementary to Bradda's existing portfolio\n\u2022\nKEX conducted exploration drilling on spodumene bearing pegmatites, completing a total of 19 holes for a total of 4,188 meters of core with assay results showing lithium hydroxide mineralization in all holes, including 41.0 meters at 1.22% Li2O in hole WSTL0009 and 19.47 meters at 1.65% Li2O in hole WSTL0008\n\u2022\nKEX has also conducted surface mapping, sampling, airborne geophysics, and collected high resolution air photos over much of the property, greatly enhancing its value\n\u2022\nNo mineral resource on the Whistlejacket property has been calculated by KEX\n\u2022\nResults from the core drilling, surface geochemistry and geological mapping show potential to expand the pegmatite mineralization laterally and at depth, whilst many pegmatites have not been drill tested and contain several rock chip samples at >2.0% Li2O\n\u2022\nSufficient due diligence has been undertaken on exploration dataset in addition to the land tenure with no technical issues being identified\n\u2022\nThe property has year-round access to road infrastructure throughout, technical personnel/services and accommodation in the nearby towns of Wickenburg or Prescott, Arizona\n\u2022\nThe Project is 140 km northwest of the state capital, Phoenix, 11 km from the Company's existing Basin asset, 80 km from San Domingo, and is 3 km away from the operational Bagdad porphyry copper-molybdenum mine operated by Freeport McMoRan.\nProposed Transaction subject to Shareholder Approval\nThe Proposed Transaction does not constitute a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, but in the interests of good governance, and in consultation with the Company's nominated adviser, under the terms of the Agreement the Proposed Transaction is subject to approval of the Company's shareholders. The Company will shortly publish a circular including a notice of general meeting (the \"\nCircular\n\"), convening a meeting of shareholder to be held (the \"\nMeeting\n\"). Details of arrangements for the Meeting will be set out in is the Circular which will be available on the Company's website at\nhttps://www.braddaheadltd.com/investors#ShareholderDocuments\n.\nIn addition to the notice of Meeting, the Circular will include a summary of the Company's current assets, details of the proposed work programme and budget for the earn-in, funding arrangements entered into as well as a recommendation as to why the Directors of the Company unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favour of the Proposed Transaction. The Circular will also include summary information from a comprehensive technical report constituting a Competent Person's Report under the AIM Rules, as well as Risk Factors and other information the Company considers relevant for a shareholder in making a decision whether to approve the Proposed Transaction. The full Competent Person's Report is available on the Company's website at\nhttps://www.braddaheadltd.com/investors#TechnicalReports\n.\nIan Stalker, Executive Chair and Director commented:\n\"Subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming general meeting, the Whistlejacket Project will be a fabulous acquisition for the Company which we are excited to add to our lithium portfolio and plan on commencing exploration as soon as possible. The project has excellent access in a great jurisdiction on state land, close to both our Basin and San Domingo projects, and has the potential to become a significant asset to the Company. Our partners at Whistlejacket are part of one of the leading international mining companies and we are delighted that they have chosen Bradda Head to drive forward the exploration and potential development of the Whistlejacket Project.\n\"The acquisition of Whistlejacket fits exceptionally well with the Company's exploration model and advancements over the past three years at San Domingo, a mere 80 km to the southeast. Subject to completion of the acquisition, all exploration dollars allocated towards Whistlejacket will go directly into the ground as the Company is planning an aggressive drilling program in the near future, once additional surface sampling and mapping are completed. The potential at Whistlejacket starts with a dedicated and experienced team that will deliver the best results possible through strategic drill testing of existing and new targets. Further information on the targets and planning will be provided in due course.\n\"The work conducted to date by KEX is of the highest standard, utilizing Best Management Practices and provides Bradda Head with an exceptional foundation to leverage our strategic and future drill planning. The extensive data collected demonstrates positive aspects for crushing and ore processing. Furthermore, and examining potential synergies, our metallurgical studies previously conducted on San Domingo drill core composites determined significant cost savings through AI assisted mineral ore sorting upgrades and provide the Company with optimism that a path to production is possible, initially at San Domingo and then Whistlejacket.\"\nEarn-in Expenditure; Convertible Loan Agreements (\"CLAs\").\nDuring the course of the earn-in, the Company will need to meet minimum expenditure and work programme milestones to acquire its interest in the Whistlejacket Project. In particular the Company will incur expenditure of not less than US$ 750,000 in the first year following approval of the Agreement (such date being the \"Completion Date\"), and up to a total of US$ 5.5 million in the first three years following the Completion Date if the Company wants to acquire the initial 51% interest. To take the Company's interest to 60% the Company will need to incur expenditures of a further US$ 12 million over a further 3-year period (US$ 3.75 million in year 4, US$ 3.75 million in year 5, and US$ 4.5 million in year 6).\nAs at the date of the Agreement the Company does not have all of the capital required to meet its earn-in commitment in Year 1 (which is guaranteed by Bradda), and to cover expenditure in the first three years following the Completion Date, required to acquire the 51% interest in the Whistlejacket Project.\nAs a bridging support facility, the Company has agreed the terms for convertible loan facilities to be made available to it by Galloway Limited (\"Galloway\") and Promaco Limited (\"Promaco\").\nGalloway is a company indirectly wholly owned by Jim Mellon, a Director of the Company, and which is the Company's largest shareholder. Promaco is indirectly wholly owned by John Ian Stalker, the Executive Chair of the Company. Under the terms of the CLAs, Galloway and Promaco will be investing US$ 1,025,000 and US$ 250,000 respectively, resulting in a total of US$ 1,275,000 in the Company (in addition to amounts already provided under the existing Galloway Facility as set out below).\nThe size of the facilities can be increased with the written agreement of Galloway and Promaco. As announced on 25 September 2025, Galloway made a US$ 500,000 facility available to the Company to support its working capital. All sums drawn under that existing loan facility, including interest thereon, shall be applied to the CLA entered into with Galloway. At the date of this Announcement, a total of US$ 500,000 has been advanced by Galloway under the existing Galloway Facility and the total principal amount subject to the CLA entered into with Galloway shall be US$ 1,525,000.\nThe terms of the CLAs are set out below:\n\u00b7\nUnsecured 24-month facility (expiry being the \"Maturity Date\");\n\u00b7\nrepaid amounts may not be redrawn;\n\u00b7\nThe outstanding balance of the CLAs (including interest) may be converted into new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at any time at the option of the lender;\n\u00b7\nThe amounts outstanding pursuant to the CLAs (including interest) will automatically convert into new Ordinary Shares concurrent with an equity financing by the Company to raise not less than \u00a32 million (gross) prior to the Maturity Date (a Qualifying Fundraise\");\n\u00b7\nConversion Price equal to 90% of the 30-day volume weighted average price at close of trading on the last trading day prior to the date notice to convert the CLAs is proposed, if converted at the election of the lender, or a price equal to 90% of the price paid by investors participating in the Qualifying Fundraise;\n\u00b7\nAmounts outstanding under the CLAs carry a 10% annual coupon, accruing monthly.\nConversion of CLAs subject to Shareholder Approval\nThe conversion of the amounts outstanding under the CLAs gives rise to certain considerations under the Company's memorandum and articles of association (\"Articles\"). As a BVI company, the Company is not subject to the UK Takeover Code. However, Regulation 24 of the Articles sets out provisions regulating takeover offers in respect of the Company. In particular, Regulation 24.2(a) provides that a person must not, whether by himself or with persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him, acquire an interest in shares which, taken together with shares in which persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him have become interested, carry 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights attributable to all the shares of the Company, except as a result of a \"Permitted Acquisition\". A \"Permitted Acquisition\" would either be (i) an acquisition approved by Shareholders (excluding any Shareholder carrying out the acquisition together with all persons determined by the Board to be acting in concert with him) or (ii) an acquisition carried out in accordance with Rule 9 of the UK Takeover Code (as if such provision applied to the Company), whereby an offer would need to be made to Shareholders.\nUnder the CLAs, a conversion notice shall not be capable of being served if as a result of the conversion pursuant to that conversion notice, the lender (being either Galloway or Promaco), together with persons with which they are acting in concert, would as a result of the conversion, hold 30% or more of the issued Ordinary Shares of the Company unless such issuance of Ordinary Shares would constitute a \"Permitted Acquisition\" (the \"Conversion Condition\").\nIt is not expected that the conversion of the Promaco CLA into Ordinary Shares will cause Promaco, together with any parties acting in concert with them, to hold 30% or more of the Ordinary Shares in issue. However, as the largest shareholder in the Company, there is a possibility that the conversion of the Galloway CLA could cause the shareholding of Galloway, together with parties acting in concert with Galloway, to reach 30% or more of the Ordinary Shares. As the conversion amount is not fixed and remains subject to determination at the time of conversion, this cannot be known for sure at this time. Accordingly, it is proposed that the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the CLAs be approved by the Shareholders independent of Galloway and Promaco (and their respective concert parties) in the Meeting for the purposes of Regulation 24.1(e)(i) and Regulation 24.2(a) of the Articles such that the conversion of the CLAs shall not cause any requirement for an offer to be made to Shareholders under Regulation 24 of the Articles.\nAIM Rule 13\nAs Jim Mellon and Denham Eke are both directors of the Company, and Jim Mellon is the 100% beneficial owner of Galloway Limited and Denham Eke its Managing Director, and John Ian Stalker, the Company's Chair, is the 100% beneficial owner of Promaco Limited, the provision of the CLAs is a Related Party Transaction under the AIM Rules. Accordingly, the independent directors, being Alex Borrelli and Euan Jenkins, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, consider that the terms of the CLAs are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned. In forming this view the independent directors have noted the following:\n- the minimum US$ 750,000 commitment of the Company over the next 12 months (should the Proposed Transaction be approved by shareholders);\n- the Board's support for the Proposed Transaction and the potential benefit the Board believes this will provide all Bradda shareholders;\n- the need to satisfy KEX that the Company has capital to meet the guaranteed expenditure prior to signing the Agreement;\n- the current cash position of the Company and the amounts due under the existing loan facilities provided by Galloway;\n- the need for the Company to complete a Qualifying Fundraise within the next 12 months, providing\ncapital to meet expenditure commitments in year two (and potentially beyond) under the Agreement;\n- planned continued expenditure of the Company on its existing assets over the next 12 months as well as general working capital requirements;\n- the unsecured nature of the CLAs;\n- the cost of alternative short-term bridge finance to satisfy KEX and prior to a Qualifying Fundraise; and\n- the positive market message of Galloway Limited, the Company's largest shareholder, and Promaco Limited, being wholly owned by the Executive Chair of Bradda Head, providing further financial support to support management.\nFurther Information Regarding the Option to Joint Venture Agreement\nPhase 1 Expenditure Requirements, Schedule and Project Milestones\n\u00b7\nFollowing agreement of shareholders, BHL will initiate Phase 1 exploration over a 3-year period with annual expenditures of\no\nUS$ 0.75 million (guaranteed expenditure) in year 1, focused on exploration;\no\nUS$ 2.0 million in year 2 on exploration, studies and permitting; and\no\nUS$ 2.75 million in year 3 on exploration, studies and permitting\nfor a total of US$ 5.5 million, which earns BHL a 51% in the Project and 49% ownership with KEX and an option to form a joint venture\n\u00b7\nWithin 90 days of completion of Phase 1, KEX will have the ability to buy back the interests in the Project from the Company. The acquisition consideration would be 2.5 times the documented expenditures by the Company to earn its interests in the Project.\n\u00b7\nIn the event that KEX does not exercise its right to buy back the interests in the Project from the Company, BHL may then choose to proceed to Phase 2 or otherwise for an incorporated joint venture to be formed with it as the 51% shareholder.\nFormation of the Technical Committee\nUpon commencement of Phase 1, BHL and KEX will form a technical committee comprised of two representatives from each party (the \"Technical Committee\"). The Technical Committee will govern the technical, logistical and budgetary matters applicable to the development of and operations on the Property until the formation of the joint venture, at a minimum of 51%/49% ownership. The Technical Committee will direct the operator with respect to the structure and requirements of any approved budget and program. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Technical Committee will constitute the decision and action of the Technical Committee. Failure to obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Technical Committee (including in the event of a deadlock) shall mean that a decision or action is not adopted. If no decision is made, the Technical Committee will negotiate in \"good faith\" until an agreeable program is adopted. The Technical Committee will meet semi-annually to review technical results, expenditures, status of tenements and any applications, work programs and budgets.\nThroughout the term of the Agreement and thereafter, BHL's subsidiary Zenolith (USA) LLC will be responsible for appointing the initial manager and operator of the Whistlejacket Project. The operator's duties shall include the adoption of a work programme and budget, maintenance of the Whistlejacket Project in good standing, maintain accounts and records for the Whistlejacket and provide the same to the KEX, develop a rigid health and safety environment to prevent accidents and environmental incidents and conduct field activities, such as drilling and road construction, with highest BMP's (Best Management Practices).\nOption to Proceed to Phase 2\nWithin 30 days of completion of Phase 1, BHL has the option to proceed to Phase 2 or can remain at 51%. If proceeding to Phase 2 it may earn into an additional 9% interest in the Project, on the following terms:\n\u00b7\nPhase 2, Year 4, expenditures of US$ 3.75 million in exploration, studies, and permitting\n\u00b7\nPhase 2, Year 5, expenditures of US$ 3.75 million in exploration, studies, and permitting\n\u00b7\nPhase 2, Year 6, expenditures of US$ 4.50 million in exploration, studies, and permitting\nAt the conclusion of Phase 2, cumulative expenditures in Phase 1 and 2 are expected to meet or exceed US$ 17 million, with Phase 2 expenditure giving BHL an additional 9% ownership and interest and bringing total ownership to 60%, with KEX owning the remaining 40% in the Whistlejacket Project. Formation of a joint venture between BHL and KEX to immediately follow completion of Phase 2.\u00a0Within 90 days of completion of Phase 2, KEX will have the ability to buy back the interests in the Project from the Company. The acquisition consideration would be 3x the documented expenditures by the Company to earn its interests in the Project.\nUpon completion of Phase 2 (and subject to the KEX not exercising its buyback options), the joint venture will proceed with weighted expenditures based upon percentage of ownership, 60% by BHL and 40% by KEX. A joint venture committee will be formed consisting of two representatives from each company. Work programs and expenditure budget proposals will be tabled on an annual basis to the joint venture committee for approval. If either company is unwilling or unable to subsidize their share of the entire proposed budget, their ownership percentage will be reduced by standard and industry accepted reduction equations.\nNet Smelter Royalty (\"NSR\")\nIf either company fails to contribute to the joint venture and their share of the new company falls below 10%, their ownership is reduced to a 2.0% NSR.\nBHL option to acquire KEX's retained interests in the Whistlejacket Project\nBHL has the option to purchase KEX's 49% interest in the Project upon completion of Phase 1, but only at the discretion of KEX. The purchase price following completion of Phase 1 would be US$ 7.5 million.
