This is a deeper well to approximately 1,800 feet which is expected to take two weeks to drill on current pre-drill forecasting. The primary objectives are two zones from which good legacy production was achieved.\nOn completion of BON-18 drilling operations and the tie in of new production the NABI drilling rig moves on to the exploratory well BON-19. This BON-19 well will be the proof of concept for the very shallow BON-14 (\"Saffron\") trend. The Company anticipates that between 5 and 7 shallow development wells will be drilled following this trend such that upon completion of this phase of drilling operations in the Bonasse field between 200 and 300 bopd of new production will be added through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nIn the Goudron field a 6-8 Heavy Workover Program shall commence by next month, with the expectation of yielding an additional 100 bopd of new production through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nThis additional production shall be supplemental to, and contemporaneous with, with the main Snowcap-3 appraisal and development well programme in the Cory Moruga Block forecast to commence in Q2 2026.\nCommencement of BON-18 drilling operations\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"We are entering an intense period of operational activity over the next 3 months in Trinidad which at the end of which could potentially double our current production output.\nWe have chosen the option to fund, operate and drill the Snowcap-3 appraisal/development well on a 100% basis as our wholly owned subsidiary (T-Rex Resources) is the exclusive Operator of the Cory Moruga block, where we shall demonstrate our in-house operational capabilities to ensure we are well-placed and qualified to acquire any new attractive opportunities that may or may not become available long-term.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOAK Securities\nJerry Keen / Calvin Mann\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development. The structure penetrated by the MOU-1 and MOU-3 wells is currently defined as having the best potential for an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026. The Company is committed to partnering with entities capable of supporting a future development decision and who have already identified the opportunity as one warranting the execution of a Collaboration Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding. Moroccan gas prices are high, and the fiscal terms are some of the best in the world.\u00a0The presence of gas export infrastructure adjacent to the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure allows for a scalable gas development after initial CNG or micro-LNG gas production over time establishes the extent of connected gas volumes and the capability of reservoirs to deliver at plateau rates over time.\nTrinidad offers the security of a mature onshore oil province that has been producing hydrocarbons for over 50 years. Predator has assembled a portfolio of onshore producing fields with opportunities for production enhancement and additional infill development and appraisal drilling. Significant legacy tax losses, economies of scale and the application of new low-cost technologies are factors that can improve profit margins per barrel of oil produced. A Master Services Agreement with local operator NABI Construction relieves the Company of the burden and costs of operating the fields and executing drilling and heavy well workovers. In return the Company receives 30% of gross sales revenues for which it can use its acquired tax losses to substantially reduce Petroleum Profit Tax from 50% to an effective rate of 12.5%.\nPredator has an experienced technical, financial and legal management team with particular knowledge of the Moroccan and Trinidad sub-surface and operations and an ability to complete M & A transactions in Trinidad and receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner and without any unnecessary advisory fees for transactions. The Company's strategy is to operate at a much reduced overhead compared to other operators with portfolios of assets of similar extent to maintain competitiveness.\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings plc is listed on the\nEquity Shares (transition) category of the Official List of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange's\u00a0main market for listed securities\n(symbol: PRD).\nFor further information, visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The placing was completed by Albr Capital Limited and Oak Securities, acting jointly.\nThe Placing utilises some of the Company's existing ability to issue shares under the\u00a0Financial Conduct's Authority\u00a0Public Offers and Admissions to Trading Regulations.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe Proceeds of the Placing, less expenses, will be spent on:\n1. Drilling and testing Snowcap-3 (\"SC-3\") appraisal and development well , operated solely by the Company, will evaluate the gross 600-foot Herrea reservoir interval that contains 8 very good quality reservoirs that produced in the former BP Moruga West field x kms to the SE.\nSnowcap-1, drilled and tested in 2010/11, tested the topmost sand (#8 Sand). The 6-foot sand flowed at initial rates of 1100 to 1450 bopd before stabilising at a rate of 500 bopd.\nIn the Snowcap-1 well the primary basal Herrera #1 and #2 sands were missed due to being faulted out.\nSC-3 location has been selected to penetrate an unfaulted section with good potential for a thickened #1 Sand.\nThe well is scheduled for Q2 2026 and is expected to take up to 20 days to drill and log to a depth of approximately 5300 feet.\nIt is intended to put the well in production in Q3 2026 after drilling and testing completes.\nSC-3 will potentially unlock the 3P resources for the Herra #1, #2# 3 and #4 Sands of 56.9MM barrels of oil.\nThe impact on the Company's forecast production for 2026 has the potential to be transformational.\nProduction from the Company's existing fields has accreted steadily over 2 months by approximately 26% to 387 bopd following the completion of two shallow development wells and 3 heavy well workovers under our Master Services Agreement with NABI. NABI will commence this month drilling the deeper TPD-CD1 to 1800 feet in the Bonasse field.\n2.

We intend to increase further our visibility in Trinidad through advancing the drilling of SC-3.\nWe have taken this opportunity to raise funds in order to undertake additional discretionary activity, strengthening the balance sheet, and enhancing production growth. Furthermore, demonstrating our operational experience and know-how gives us greater leverage to attract oil majors into our assets at some point. The offshore Guyana petroleum system extends into our licences. The TGB-6 fan in Morocco is geologically similar to the large biogenic gas fields of the East Mediterranean.

We are excited about the potential production capabilities of the new well scheduled for Goudron given the unexpected higher level of production from the GY-211 well workover. We are already ahead of our production target for February 2026.\nTrinidad is part of a World Class oil and gas province that has recently assumed greater geopolitical strategic significance. The potential future re-entry of the oil majors to Venezuela could facilitate a return of larger service companies to Trinidad, thereby increasing competitiveness and access to in-country materials and services to lower drilling costs.\nOur decision to expand our footprint onshore Trinidad in 2025 has been fully justified and we look to further develop our strategic business opportunities in 2026.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development.

Bonasse field oil sales point established at South Erin field.\n3. Two existing Bonasse field wells restored to production and a new shallow infill development well BON-16 drilled in November and put on production.\n4. Increased Bonasse field production by 220 % since 30 October 2025.\n5. Increased production from Goudron, Inniss-Trinity and Icacos fields by 5% between 1 September and 31 October 2025 through better field management.\nFocus to date on improving infrastructure and access roads to areas with wells selected for heavy workovers and sites for infill drilling, and on ordering well inventory.\n6. All fields are now returned to profitability after significant reductions in licence management and administrative costs through consolidation.\n7. Predator management team can now focus on developing and planning new, high value opportunities to drill under the Production and Field Services Management Agreement and on reviewing any new M & A opportunities.\n2026 fully-funded forward programme\nJanuary\nBON-17 second infill development well due to commence at the end of 2025 will be tied into production.\nFirst of 13 heavy well workovers

wells.\n2026 outlook\nThe programme of infield development drilling, heavy workovers of old production wells and Cory Moruga appraisal/development drilling is targeting increasing current production to 1,000 bopd on exiting 2026.\nUsing 2025 actual Predator net revenue receipts this is forecast to generate between a five to ten fold increase in monthly production revenues depending on a successful outcome to operations and the prevailing oil price (average monthly Predator share of sales revenues for September and October 2025 US$100,405).\nOnshore Morocco\n2025 progress\n\u00b7\nMOU-3 rigless testing of the shallow \"A\" Sand verified for the first time the extent and causes of formation damage linked to the original drilling programme.\nIt validated the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations and gas shows seen whilst drilling before mud weight was increased to shut off gas inflow into the well.\nIt provided the data necessary to ensure that appraisal/development wells can be programmed to mitigate against formation damage to enure maximum possible stabilised gas flow rates from the NuTech-interpreted gas reservoirs.\n\u00b7\nFocus for initial appraisal and potential development is confined to the section above 950 metres in MOU-3 in the structure penetrated by MOU-1 and MOU-3.\nOn this basis discussions with two parties are ongoing on the basis of a fully-funded CNG and/or micro-LNG development.\n\u00b7\nA request with agreed terms for an Amendment No.5 to extend the First Extension Period of the Guercif Petroleum Agreement from 5 March 2026 to 5 November 2026 has been submitted.\nThis will allow time for a programme of work to be completed to potentially support an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026.\n\u00b7\nMOU-5 was successfully drilled to 1,137 metres and logged using improved drilling practices deployed by the Company's new drilling team to significantly minimise over-balanced drilling.\nMOU-5 was drilled under budget.\nA helium show was encountered that supported the pre-drill helium generation and migration concept.\nMobilised Triassic salt from a depth below the well was unexpectedly penetrated.\nMOU-5 is a potentially play-opening well for a deeper Triassic TAGI reservoir target that is expected to have good reservoir properties based on a 100-foot Jurassic sand encountered at the base of MOU-5.\n2026 forward programme\nJanuary/February\nAn updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure.\nValidation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres.\nA fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept.\nDesktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well.\nThe purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme.\nA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area.\n2026\nOutlook\nThe Company is fully committed to partnering up for potential appraisal and scalable development of its discovered gas in the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure.\nSubject to a final agreement that incorporates a funding mechanism for an appraisal and development programme the Company will pursue its schedule to complete the work necessary for an application for an Exploitation Concession by the end of Q3 2026.\nOffshore Ireland\nThe Company notes that Ireland has recognised security of gas supply and gas storage as a critically important issue by announcing the proposed State-owned FSRU concept as a future strategic national gas reserve.\nThe Company believes that the concept, which includes a jetty and an onshore pipeline and terminal, will only only be realised after several years based on the historical Corrib gas terminal planning and environmental experience.\nFar more practical, and likely to be delivered in a shorter timeframe, is an offshore FSRU facility linked to a subsurface storage reservoir in one of the very few remaining oil and gas licences offshore Ireland.\nThis could be a public/private sector joint facility combining a strategic gas storage reserve with a commercial business to minimise or eliminate the cost to the consumer so as not to further exacerbate the cost of living crisis, which is linked to energy affordability all-year-round.\nThe Company intends to make an application in early 2026 to the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment under Ireland's Freedom of Information Act to compile all internal documents relating to the award of the Corrib South successor authorisation.\nThe results should be interesting and revealing of the protracted procedural process that has been drawn out for over 7 years, contrary to any reasonable industry expectations of acting in good faith.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of Predator, commented:\n\"By the end of 2025 we have eliminated our exposure to field operating costs and the requirement for capital to grow our production and revenues in Trinidad and returned our acquired assets to making an operating profit through astute restructuring of local companies and application of legacy tax losses.\nThe fully-funded programme to significantly increase production has commenced already and will accelerate through the first half of 2026, with up to 12 new wells and 14 heavy workovers currently scheduled.\nSenior management is freed up from administrative burdens to focus on generating new high-value drilling opportunities in the Trinidad acreage.\nIn Morocco we have reached a position after the 2025 work programme where we can now leverage our position in discovered gas to secure a partnership for funding for an appraisal and potential development programme.\nThe oil and gas sector outside of Europe, where the Company prefers to operate, is showing a marked pick-up in exploration and development and M & A activity. This is in marked contrast to most of western Europe and the UK, which is suffering from a security of energy supply issue and cost of living crisis due to lack of investment in developing indigenous gas. We have no such investment constraints in the jurisdictions we operate in, where hydrocarbons, especially gas, are viewed as key ingredients to a much longer-term and more credible, less economically painful, energy transition process.\nWe thank our shareholders for their support during a year that has seen extremely challenging public market conditions for the oil and gas sector in general. We look forward to 2026 turning sentiment around.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development.
