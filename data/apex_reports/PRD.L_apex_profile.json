This is a deeper well to approximately 1,800 feet which is expected to take two weeks to drill on current pre-drill forecasting. The primary objectives are two zones from which good legacy production was achieved.\nOn completion of BON-18 drilling operations and the tie in of new production the NABI drilling rig moves on to the exploratory well BON-19. This BON-19 well will be the proof of concept for the very shallow BON-14 (\"Saffron\") trend. The Company anticipates that between 5 and 7 shallow development wells will be drilled following this trend such that upon completion of this phase of drilling operations in the Bonasse field between 200 and 300 bopd of new production will be added through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nIn the Goudron field a 6-8 Heavy Workover Program shall commence by next month, with the expectation of yielding an additional 100 bopd of new production through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nThis additional production shall be supplemental to, and contemporaneous with, with the main Snowcap-3 appraisal and development well programme in the Cory Moruga Block forecast to commence in Q2 2026.\nCommencement of BON-18 drilling operations\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"We are entering an intense period of operational activity over the next 3 months in Trinidad which at the end of which could potentially double our current production output.\nWe have chosen the option to fund, operate and drill the Snowcap-3 appraisal/development well on a 100% basis as our wholly owned subsidiary (T-Rex Resources) is the exclusive Operator of the Cory Moruga block, where we shall demonstrate our in-house operational capabilities to ensure we are well-placed and qualified to acquire any new attractive opportunities that may or may not become available long-term.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOAK Securities\nJerry Keen / Calvin Mann\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development. The structure penetrated by the MOU-1 and MOU-3 wells is currently defined as having the best potential for an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026. The Company is committed to partnering with entities capable of supporting a future development decision and who have already identified the opportunity as one warranting the execution of a Collaboration Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding. Moroccan gas prices are high, and the fiscal terms are some of the best in the world.\u00a0The presence of gas export infrastructure adjacent to the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure allows for a scalable gas development after initial CNG or micro-LNG gas production over time establishes the extent of connected gas volumes and the capability of reservoirs to deliver at plateau rates over time.\nTrinidad offers the security of a mature onshore oil province that has been producing hydrocarbons for over 50 years. Predator has assembled a portfolio of onshore producing fields with opportunities for production enhancement and additional infill development and appraisal drilling. Significant legacy tax losses, economies of scale and the application of new low-cost technologies are factors that can improve profit margins per barrel of oil produced. A Master Services Agreement with local operator NABI Construction relieves the Company of the burden and costs of operating the fields and executing drilling and heavy well workovers. In return the Company receives 30% of gross sales revenues for which it can use its acquired tax losses to substantially reduce Petroleum Profit Tax from 50% to an effective rate of 12.5%.\nPredator has an experienced technical, financial and legal management team with particular knowledge of the Moroccan and Trinidad sub-surface and operations and an ability to complete M & A transactions in Trinidad and receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner and without any unnecessary advisory fees for transactions. The Company's strategy is to operate at a much reduced overhead compared to other operators with portfolios of assets of similar extent to maintain competitiveness.\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings plc is listed on the\nEquity Shares (transition) category of the Official List of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange's\u00a0main market for listed securities\n(symbol: PRD).\nFor further information, visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The 6-foot sand flowed at initial rates of 1100 to 1450 bopd before stabilising at a rate of 500 bopd.\nIn the Snowcap-1 well the primary basal Herrera #1 and #2 sands were missed due to being faulted out.\nSC-3 location has been selected to penetrate an unfaulted section with good potential for a thickened #1 Sand.\nThe well is scheduled for Q2 2026 and is expected to take up to 20 days to drill and log to a depth of approximately 5300 feet.\nIt is intended to put the well in production in Q3 2026 after drilling and testing completes.\nSC-3 will potentially unlock the 3P resources for the Herra #1, #2# 3 and #4 Sands of 56.9MM barrels of oil.\nThe impact on the Company's forecast production for 2026 has the potential to be transformational.\nProduction from the Company's existing fields has accreted steadily over 2 months by approximately 26% to 387 bopd following the completion of two shallow development wells and 3 heavy well workovers under our Master Services Agreement with NABI. NABI will commence this month drilling the deeper TPD-CD1 to 1800 feet in the Bonasse field.\n2.

The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore 814,857,814.\u00a0This figure of 814,857,814 may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for calculations to determine if they have a notifiable interest in the share capital of the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, or if such interest has changed.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"Trinidad is a re-emerging oil and gas province for the oil majors again fuelled by successes offshore Guyana and the new strategic importance of nearby Venezuela. We intend to increase further our visibility in Trinidad through advancing the drilling of SC-3.\nWe have taken this opportunity to raise funds in order to undertake additional discretionary activity, strengthening the balance sheet, and enhancing production growth. Furthermore, demonstrating our operational experience and know-how gives us greater leverage to attract oil majors into our assets at some point. The offshore Guyana petroleum system extends into our licences. The TGB-6 fan in Morocco is geologically similar to the large biogenic gas fields of the East Mediterranean. Demonstrating materiality will be an important consideration for any potential farminee but recent geo-political developments have enhanced the potential for M & A consolidation\".\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOAK Securities\nJerry Keen / Calvin Mann\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development.

The potential future re-entry of the oil majors to Venezuela could facilitate a return of larger service companies to Trinidad, thereby increasing competitiveness and access to in-country materials and services to lower drilling costs.\nOur decision to expand our footprint onshore Trinidad in 2025 has been fully justified and we look to further develop our strategic business opportunities in 2026.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development.

The \"A\" Sand section was initially drilled with lighter mud (SG 1.15 density). Potential sands from the perforated reservoir interval could also be identified if present.\nWhilst drilling through the \"A\" Sand in 2023 natural gas flow into the well was noted, with the well approximately 50 psi under-balanced at 341 metres measured depth from surface.\nInitial results\nSamples recovered at surface by nitrogen lift contained progressively less dense drilling mud filtrate and eventually very fine grained, unconsolidated sand. Comparison of the sand samples with well cuttings collected whilst drilling MOU-3 gave a high level of confidence that the \"A\" Sand had been successfully perforated.\nThe perforations may however have extended close to, but not beyond, the maximum limit of probable formation damage caused during drilling.\nThe well is currently filled with nitrogen and shut in to facilitate any potential slow pressure build-up and clean up close to the possible limits of the formation damage.\nForward programme\nDrilling\nDesktop studies have commenced to generate a new well design and drilling mud programme incorporating the valuable information gathered from the drilling of MOU-1, MOU-2, MOU-3 and MOU-4 and testing of some of the wells. These wells were designed based on the established drilling history of the Gharb Basin.\nCurrent well design, mud programmes and drilling practices are not optimal for the nature of the reservoir geology now established. Formation damage is a key issue.\nPreparations are progressing to drill and log this year an MOU-6 well, with a surface location at the MOU-3 well pad. The well will evaluate all the sands seen in MOU-3 above 950 metres.\nFocus will be on minimising formation damage in respect of the reservoir's ability to produce hydrocarbons by using specialised drilling fluids, if necessary, and drilling as far as possible on balance to account for the fine grained and unconsolidated sand intervals that are susceptible to wash out.\nChoice of perforating guns\nThe MOU-3 testing programme has shown that only the larger 2\n7/8\n\" perforating guns are suitable for rigless testing in this area. Sandjet is not being considered any more as a perforating option.\nBudget\nThe MOU-3 rigless testing programme was executed under budget.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"We are pleased that by accessing the larger perforating guns for the first time that we have managed to collect valuable information to improve our understanding of the extent and nature of the formation damage caused by over-balanced drilling.\nWhilst the perforating has been successful, thus far it has not been able to completely overcome the formation damage to allow the well to flow. Pressure build up in the well is being monitored to see if with time the damage can be overcome.\nThe new well, MOU-6, is being designed to mitigate for formation damage and is crucial for evaluating potential well productivity and reservoir performance at several levels.\nWe will seek to execute the MOU-6 drilling programme at the earliest opportunity this year in order to maintain momentum.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Exe",

The agreement provided for the regulatory approval necessary for closing of the sale to be finalised by 30 April 2025. This date was extended to 30 June 2025, following the parties administrative closing uncertainty due to the snap-election called in Trinidad and Tobago in mid-March and the resulting change in Government in May 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Company and the Seller have since made substantial progress in terms of satisfying requirements for the grant of the necessary regulatory approval, albeit the process has not fully finalised. The parties have thus agreed to further extend the date for closing of the sale and purchase transaction to 7 days after the granting of regulatory approval, with a revised longstop date of 30 August 2025.\n\u00b7\nIn anticipation of completion in the near term, the Company and the Seller have commenced working collaboratively on the ground in Trinidad, so as to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of ownership and operations once final regulatory approval is obtained.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"Over the last two months we have been carrying out an internal technical and commercial re-assessment of the Company's diverse portfolio of assets in Morocco and Trinidad. This has taken into account prevailing uncertainty in terms of equity market volatility, crude oil price fluctuations and unstable foreign exchange markets. All of these factors combine to under-value early stage oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development.\nFollowing this review the Company is focussed going forward on preserving its cash; maintain its debt-free status; increasing its portfolio of producing assets in Trinidad; financing and monetising its near-term oil and gas development projects at minimal cost to the Company; and maintaining third party-funded future \"blue sky\" exploration potential for gas and helium.\nAcquisition of the CEG operations in Trinidad will facilitate production growth and revenue generation through integration with our existing production operations to deliver economies of scale.\nPreparations and planning are ongoing to drill the Snowcap-3 well in Q1 2026. A rig has been identified and subject to certification a rig contract will be entered into. The Snowcap-3 appraisal well is targeting the best producing sand in BP's former Moruga West field 1.5 kilometres southeast of the Snowcap-3 proposed well location. In Moruga West individual wells have flowed initially at up to 303 bopd from this single interval with maximum well recovery for a single well of 455,000 barrels of oil over field life has been achieved. Snowcap-3 is therefore a key well for boosting our producing portfolio and can potentially be tied in quickly and at low cost to enable early monetisation. There are several options to organically-finance the well later this year through an asset sale and/or partnering with a local company.\nIn Morocco we will update the market this month on the execution of the testing programme for the shallow \"A Sand\" in MOU-3, for which we are fully-funded. We will announce a collaboration agreement for the design, financing and execution of the initial phase of the MOU-3 development upon publication of the test results. We anticipate first gas sales by the end of 2026 subject to all the usual caveats of regulatory approval and technical due diligence.\nWe are completing our review of the MOU-5 drilling results and will be updating the market on progress after the testing of MOU-3 has been completed.\nMOU-5 is an important well as it has introduced a completely different understanding of the key Mesozoic section on the flanks of the Guercif biogenic gas system and thus what might be under it as well.\u00a0As a result there is potential to be investigated and refined for a deeper, large Triassic objective under MOU-5, analogous to the geological settings of the Meskala, Tendrara and Hassi R'Mel (Algeria) gas fields, albeit up to 1,000 metres shallower which should enhance possible reservoir quality. This is in addition to the original primary objective in MOU-5 of the Jurassic",

Encouragingly this increased the thickness and potential effectiveness of the topseal.\n\u00b7\nGood quality resistivity and sonic wireline logs were acquired over the top 50 meters of the Domerian carbonate.\n\u00b7\nThis zone will be further evaluated by a petrographic study of well cutting samples to establish the relationship of the Domerian carbonate section penetrated downdip by MOU-5 to the main development and culmination of the carbonate bank to the northwest of the well.\n\u00b7\nThe helium chromatograph registered a 1557 ppm helium show 16 metres above the top of the Domerian carbonate. This has been correlated probably with the presence of a flat-lying fault connecting to the area of salt diapiric activity to the east of the well.\n\u00b7\nPost-well evaluation of the MOU-5 structure on the 2D seismic line through the well shows that MOU-5 is located approximately 100 metres below the culmination of the Domerian carbonate bank to the northwest of the well.\n\u00b7\nBelow the Domerian carbonate MOU-5 unexpectedly encountered approximately 30 metres of good quality gross sand that had never been seen before in the Guercif Basin.\nForward Plan\n\u00b7\nThe MOU-5 well has been suspended to allow for a re-entry at a later date and Star Valley Rig 101 has been released but will remain stacked at the MOU-5 location.\n\u00b7\nData from MOU-5 will be analysed and incorporated in a new \"Jurassic Project\" that will focus on the core area of the Domerian structure to the northwest of MOU-5 structure.\n\u00b7\nThe presence of the Domerian carbonate has now been proven but 3D seismic will be necessary to characterize the carbonate reservoir in the area. A farmout process will be initiated for the 3D seismic acquisition.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of Predator, commented:\n\"\nThe results of the MOU-5 drilling programme have unlocked a new Jurassic play-opening trend never before tested in the Guercif Basin. A helium show has provided the impetus to further assess the helium potential of the MOU-5 structure.\nConfirmation of our pre-drill play concept and seismic inversion modelling work based on limited 2D seismic data allows for the acquisition of more focussed additional seismic data to clarify the updip potential.\nPenetration of a new, good quality sandstone interval below the primary target was unexpected and provides a new target in the basin.\nThe way forward from this point on is to evaluate the data from the well and then to seek a farminee to join the Jurassic Project. The MOU-5 well has confirmed that the large MOU-5 structure has to be further investigated based on new seismic data.\nWe are very confident, following the MOU-5 drilling results, that a potential farminee will recognise the value proposition assignable to the Jurassic Project\nRationalisation and monetisation must be the drivers to support shareholder value during 2025, which promises to be a particularly volatile year, potentially dominated by trade wars.\nWe can focus now on ramping up our Trinidad production in 2025 and completing an additional rigless testing programme for MOU-3 for the shallowest sand encountered in the well and not yet evaluated for a potential CNG initial development option.\nLastly, I would like to congratulate our Drilling Team and Country Manager for delivering the MOU-5 drilling project on schedule, within budget, without incident, and in a manner that satisfied all of our pre-drill geological objectives. Simplifying last year our management structure and improving internal communications with our project teams has delivered the drilling performance that we had hoped for and has saved costs.\"\nFor further",

Several existing opportunities to increase conventional field production were previously identified by management\n\u00b7\nThe Company is confident that the application of informed subsurface geological understanding combined with the\npatented SGN Technology for chemical wax treatment, presently being prepared for the Jacobin-1 workover in the Cory Moruga licence, will enhance production throughout the portfolio of producing assets being acquired\n\u00b7\nThe Company's management will work together with the highly experienced local operational staff and its preferred service contractors to merge their expertise so as to implement targeted field operations for higher reward outcomes and to lower operating and administrative costs across its portfolio of assets as it gears up to drill Snowcap-3. It alleviates the need for additional staffing for the development and commercialisation of the Cory Moruga field and to enhance production in the Bonasse field\n\u00b7\nEnhanced production achieves a better utilisation of consolidated tax losses\nConsideration\n\u00b7\nan initial deposit of $250,000 - this has been satisfied via the issuance to CEG of 4,411,641 unrestricted Predator shares (\"the Deposit Shares\")\n\u00b7\n$750,000 payable on completion - $250,000 in cash and $500,000 via the issuance of unrestricted Predator shares (the number of Predator shares to be issued to be determined based on the prevailing exchange rate and market price of Predator shares at the time of completion)\n\u00b7\ndeferred unconditional consideration payments of $750,000, payable in cash, in three instalments of $250,000, on each of 31 December 2025, 2026, and 2027\n\u00b7\nthe assumption by CRL of all liabilities, provisions and potential exposures of the business, assets and operations in Trinidad and Tobago (the \"Legacy Liabilities\"), which for the purposes of the sale agreement were agreed to be in the amount of $4.25 million",

There are no remaining work commitments.\nConsideration\nThe Consideration for the strategic investment in CRL is US$170,000.\nThe investment in CRL will give TRex ownership of the Bonasse field facilities, including oil storage tanks, some of which will be required for the Cory Moruga workovers and ultimate field development. The value of these assets therefore can be offset against the costs that would have been incurred in purchasing some production facilities required for the Jacobin-1 and Snowcap-1 workovers and the eventual appraisal of the Snowcap oil field. These costs were already factored into the Company's existing working capital requirements therefore this investment removes the need for this expenditure.\nThere shall be US$5.3 million in tax losses in CRL and its subsidiaries, if warranted these can be amalgamated and consolidated in the future with the tax losses in T-Rex.\nRationale for the strategic investment\n\u00b7\nThe Bonasse field currently contains 7 wells that were producing until being recently shut in for third-party contractual and non-operational reasons.\n\u00b7\nThe structure of the field is analogous to that of the Cory Moruga and Moruga West fields\n\u00b7\nLegacy analysis of the well drainage areas based on extrapolated pressure data for some shallow Middle Cruse reservoirs above 2,000 feet drilling depth indicate a typical drainage area of 4.5 acres per well and a STOIIP volume of 382,500 barrels of 22.8 API oil. Historical primary recovery factor is as low as 4.18%.\n\u00b7\nLow primary recovery factor creates an opportunity for the application of the patented SGN Technology chemical wax treatment, presently being prepared for the Jacobin-1 workover in the Company's Cory Moruga licence, to enhance recovery and oil flow rates.\n\u00b7\nOptimising the costs of shallow drilling and applying a successful chemical wax treatment to generate a payback on investment after 6 months are crucial factors to be taken into account before developing the undrained areas of the field.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of Predator, commented:\n\"\nThe transaction that we have announced today represents another step towards building a robust production portfolio suitable for the application of a new patented chemical wax treatment and rigorous management oversight of field operating and administrative costs to maximise profit margins and avail of substantive inherited tax losses through economies of scale and establishing operational synergies.\nIf the new chemical wax treatment proves to be a \"game changer\" in the context of improving and maintaining oil flow rates, then further field development by reinvesting production income will be warranted.\nGrowing an income in United States Dollars will provide some protection against the weakness of the United Kingdom currency at this time .\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nNovum Securities Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOak Securities\nJerry Keen\nTel: +44 (0)207 399 9425\nTel: +44 (0)203 973 3678\nJerry.keen@oak-securities.com\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nMark Edwards\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 ",

It is a rare opportunity to drill a potentially high-impact structure adjacent to an existing gas infrastructure in an attractive fiscal regime.\nOur hydrocarbon sector has seen a global resurgence of interest and activity outside of the UK and Europe over the past few months led by the United States, Norway, Middle East, Africa and Far East.\nDwindling gas storage reserves in Europe this winter and geopolitical concerns over security of gas supply provides cold comfort for policy makers seeking to reduce energy costs and promote economic growth.\nWe are potentially entering a \"golden age\" for gas exploration and production to support: the energy transition by lowering CO2 emissions through replacing coal and oil; and to ameliorate energy price rises by increasing supply and security of access to gas at \"crunch\" times, when renewable energy cannot cope due to unattractive weather conditions.\nIt is not often that macro geopolitical and economic factors align with a gas development strategy. We are currently in that cycle and ready to attempt to take advantage of it.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nNovum Securities Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOak Securities\nJerry Keen\nTel: +44 (0)207 399 9425\nTel: +44 (0)203 973 3678\nJerry.keen@oak-securities.com\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nMark Edwards\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a diversified portfolio of scaled assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure, with multiple fully financed upcoming catalysts.\nPredator has an interesting gas project in Morocco with fast pace of commercialisation and significant upside.

The Warrants have an expiry date of three years from the date of Admission.\nThe Warrants, if exercised in whole or in part, potentially provides the Company with additional funding on the back of a successful outcome to the MOU-5 drilling programme in Q1 2025 for follow-up appraisal/pre-development drilling.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company has ordinary shares of no par value in issue, each with one vote per share (and none of which are held in treasury). The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore 611,874,754.\u00a0This figure of 611,874,754 may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for calculations to determine if they have a notifiable interest in the share c",

These shares rank\npari passu\nwith the existing ordinary shares of the Company.\nFollowing the issue of the 1,491,889 Shares, the Company's issued ordinary share capital shall consist of 571,874,754 ordinary shares.\nThis figure of 571,874,754 represents the total voting rights in the Company and should be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculation by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance & Transparency Rules.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of Predator, commented:\n\"Given the potential size of the MOU-5 structure and its geological setting, this independent report on He potential enhances the case for the evaluation of potential helium presence in MOU-5. Although at an early stage of evaluation the opportunity to assess the ability to add value to an area development should not be missed.\nThe Company is delighted to have received an unsolicited proposal from advisers to take shares as a measure of the understanding and confidence that exists in the Company's near-term newsflow activity.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at",

Dr. Tingas has worked with the Company's CEO on reservoir engineering projects offshore Ireland following the successful testing of gas at commercial rates in 2006 and 2007; on the reservoir engineering for the Tendrara field onshore Morocco in 2013, following which an appraisal well flowed at a high rate; and on the Company's Inniss-Trinity CO2 EOR project in Trinidad, where enhanced oil production was achieved.\nThe Company is fully funded to undertake all additional operations that may be considered necessary to support reservoir flow assurance for the purposes of planning a potential development option.\nAppointment of Zenith Energy Limited (Aberdeen) for well engineering support\nZenith Energy Limited (Aberdeen), with their larger pool of worldwide resources to call upon in the areas of well engineering, project management, completion and well testing and well operator services, have been appointed to provide well engineering support for Morocco initially and potentially other geographic areas if and when required.\nMOU-5 well and potential for helium\nThe geological model for the helium potential of the 187 km2 MOU-5 structure has been completed by Scorpiongeoscience. Potential helium resources estimates will be published this month.\nDrilling of the high impact MOU-5 well will evaluate potential both for helium and a gas-to-power project adjacent to the Maghreb Gas Pipeline. MOU-5 is a conventional well that does not require the same specialist Rharb Basin drilling experience and expertise that was necessary to successfully complete the 2021 and 2023 drilling programmes.\nTrinidad\nMemorandum of Understanding for patented Saudi Arabian chemical wax treatment\nThe Company has executed a Memorandum of Understanding with a local company to apply a patented wax treatment originating in Saudi Arabia to the Jacobin-1 oil reservoirs.\nJacobin-1 well workover\nAn oil sample has been collected from Jacobin-1 well and sent to an in-country laboratory to carry out a wax analysis.\nOn sampling the oil in Jacobin-1 reservoir pressure was also found to have increased to over 1600 psi over time from when two of five potential oil zones were perforated but not produced by the previous operator. Reservoir pressure is encouragingly now similar to that of the original pressure of the adjoining Moruga West Field prior to its development.\nAdjacent wells in the Moruga West oil field have initially flowed 60 bopd from just one of the above five reservoir intervals penetrated by Jacobin-1.\nThe proposed chemical treatment for Jacobin-1 will simultaneously apply heat and release nitrogen in the oil reservoirs to potentially provide a sustainable increase in oil flow into the well bore.\nIn the Saudi Arabian examples the chemical wax treatment has shown to increase oil flow rates by up to threefold.\nA successful wax treatment of Jacobin-1, followed by Snowcap-1, may have a significant implication for potentially increasing cash flow from low-cost well workovers, particularly as the Company has US$ 55 million of inherited tax losses in Trinidad to offset against Petroleum Profit Tax. Falls in oil price below WTI US$70 per barrel are offset by the disapplication of 18% Supplementary Petroleum Profit Tax below this spot price.\nIncrease in equity in Cory Moruga Licence approved\nThe Company has received the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries consent for the acquisition of the remaining 16.2% interest in the Cory Moruga Licence for a zero cash consideration.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of Predator, commented:\n\"The Company's operations are progressing smoothly.

A licence valid until 6 April 2025 has subsequently been granted to the Company to temporarily occupy the site for MOU-5 well operations.\nAn updated Independent Technical Report by Scorpion Geoscience Limited for the Jurassic MOU-5 structure gives net P50 upside Prospective Resources for gas of 5.916 TCF to the Company, with a conservative risking of 12% versus the Company's internal upside Chance of Success of 50%.\nThe MOU-5 drilling objectives remain as announced on 6 June 2024.\nOperational planning has now re-commenced, with the regulatory process concluded, to complete the MOU-5 drilling programme this year at the earliest opportunity.\nMOU-5 and MOU-4 well rigless testing to evaluate helium presence potential\nBackground to helium potential - MOU-3 gas sample\nThe gas sample analysed at 1395 metres MD KB in the Moulouya Fan in MOU-3, unlike any other shallower gas sample collected whilst drilling, showed evidence for the presence of helium. MOU-3 was drilled closed to significant faults extending down into basement rocks.\nThe Company will be undertaking a more detailed independent review of the potential for helium over the coming months, which will incorporate results from the MOU-4 rigless testing programme. Multispectral satellite spectroscopy analysis will also be undertaken over the Guercif licence area.\nBased on the available data, the Company has decided to include a test for helium in the MOU-4 rigless testing programme and for a potential testing programme for MOU-5 if the well results are positive for gas. Testing operations will be coordinated to take place immediately after drilling of the MOU-5 well, before the rig is demobilised to another location, in order to make cost-effective use of an on-site pressure-volume-temperature (\"PVT\"\") laboratory to provide more accurate screening for the presence of potential helium gas.\nPaul Griffiths, Executive Chairman of Predator, commented:\n\"\nWhilst MOU-5 is focussed on finding potential gas resources of a sufficient size to service the gas-to-power market in Morocco, the evaluation of the potential for helium presence would be an added value to the area development. Recent helium discoveries and newsflow is leading to a better understanding of how and where helium deposits might be generated. It is likely that this has been over-looked in the past where the focus has been on developing hydrocarbon potential in areas which potentially are also helium domains. We are cautious but excited regarding the potential for helium in Guercif. The Moulouya Fan and the carbonate reservoirs that may be encountered in MOU-5 have the ability to hold large volumes of gas and have effective seals.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please ",

This comprised primarily the Baker Hughes logging and coiled tubing units which were sourced from the Netherlands. Pictures of the coiled tubing unit, new to Morocco, have been uploaded to the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nto provide context for the scale of the operation being undertaken by the Company.\nThe delay in customs clearance was\nbeyond management's control\n.\nFirst Extension Period\nRatification of Petroleum Agreement Amendment No. 4 which extended the Initial Period of the Guercif Petroleum Agreement and corresponding Exploration Permits to 61 months until 5 June, 2024 was announced on 1 May 2024.\nAn application to enter the First Extension Period was submitted as required 2 months before the expiry of the Initial Period on 5 June 2024.\nConfirmation of entering the First Extension Period requires obtaining the required statutory approvals under the form of an order executed by the Ministry of Energy approving the extension to the Exploration Permits into the First Extension Period.\nMOU-3 rigless testing programme unchanged\nThe Company's rigless testing operations commenced before 5 June 2024 with site preparations at MOU-3 with initial customs clearances received on 12 June 2024 to import the Sandjet testing tools and chemicals. Unfortunately it was beyond management's control that the programme would be subsequently impacted by the ratification required to approve entering the First Extension Period with a corresponding delay in receiving further customs clearances.\nThe Company took steps to manage the mobilisation logistics to ensure that no significant standby costs were incurred whilst waiting on regulatory documentation.\nAt all times the Company's primary concern was to maintain the ability to utilise the key rigless testing equipment and services within its available time slot for exclusive use by the Company. This we have successfully achieved.\nThe Company is introducing new rigless testing technology in the form of the Sandjet testing tools and the Baker Hughes coiled tubing unit. Positive results from MOU-3 could potentially transform rigless testing strategies and increase cost-effectiveness.\nThe MOU-3 testing programme remains as announced on 6 June 2024.\nA further operations update will follow once the MOU-3 rigless testing programme is completed.\nThe Company does not intend to provide an operations schedule for testing at present as plans remain flexible and may be modified depending on initial test results and operational efficiencies.\nThe Company thanks ONHYM for their ongoing support and partnership through the regulatory process which largely resulted from the Company's desire to keep the momentum of operations going in order to avail of limited availability of well services equipment in a competitive global market.\nPaul Griffiths, Executive Chairman of Predator, commented:\n\"\nIt goes without saying that the last 12 months following the achievement of the MOU-3 and MOU-4 drilling programmes has been immensely frustrating for Directors, Management and shareholders alike. Planning for rigless testing has been impacted by several amendments to the Initial Period of the Guercif Petroleum Agreement, whilst trying to balance access to limited well services and equipment caused by global competition. Ours is a big operation for Morocco but not by global standards. We have to be patient and creative.\nHowever, by entering the First Extension Period we can look forward to re-establishing our operational momentum and newsflow.\nOur near-term ability to supply CNG to the Moroccan industry is more advanced than other possible options. The Company is debt-free which allows it to have greater flexibility when considering different options, including M&A transactions and a partial divestment, for the modest levels of development finance required for \"First Gas\". This is why Afriquia Gaz remains heavily engag",

The current focus of the exploration and appraisal drilling programme is located less than 10 kilometres from the Maghreb gas pipeline. The MOU-1 well drilled in 2021 and the MOU-3 and MOU-4 wells drilled in 2023 have been completed for rigless testing in early 2024. Near-term focus is on supplying compressed natural gas (\"CNG\") to the Moroccan industrial market. A Collaboration Agreement for potential CNG gas sales of up to 50 mm cfgpd has been executed with Afriquia Gaz. Further drilling activity is anticipated in 2024 to further evaluate the MOU-4 Jurassic prospect.\nPredator is seeking in the medium term to apply CO2 EOR techniques onshore Trinidad which have the advantage of sequestrating anthropogenic carbon dioxide. The acquisition of T-Rex Resources (Trinidad) Ltd. (\"T-Rex\") is a first step to realising this objective. T-Rex holds the Cory Moruga Production Licence. Cory Moruga is a largely undeveloped near-virgin oil field of similar potential size to the nearby Moruga West and Inniss-Trinity mature oil fields. The Cory Moruga Production Licence is a potentially significant asset for the Company with the capability of generating positive operating profits in the near-term. Capital required for staged field development can be implemented potentially utilising operating profits generated from an increasing level of gross production revenues.\nPredator owns and operates exploration and appraisal assets in licensing options offshore Ireland, for which successor authorisations have been applied for, adjoining Vermilion's Corrib gas field in the Slyne Basin on the Atlantic Margin and east of the decommissioned Kinsale gas field in the Celtic Sea. The applications for successor authorisations remain \"under consideration\" by the DECC.\nPredator has developed a Floating Storage and Regasification Project (\"FSRUP\") for the import of LNG and its regassification for Ireland and is also developing gas storage concepts to address security of gas supply and volatility in gas prices during times of peak gas demand.\nFurther progress for the Mag Mell FSRUP will be dependent on government policy in relation to security of energy supply. A generalised FSRUP concept has now been recognised by the government as an option for security of energy supply.\nThe Company has a small but highly experienced management team with a proven track record in successfully executing drilling operations in the oil and gas sector and in acquiring assets where there is a potential to generate multiple returns for relatively low and manageable levels of investment.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Each interval will be isolated with a retrievable plug after testing to prevent cross-flow of any produced gas at different pressures between deeper and shallower reservoir sands. Pressure data will be collected and analysed for each interval to determine the extent of any connected potential gas volume compared to pre-test volumes estimated to be in place in the 13.9 km2 MOU-3 structure (the \"Moulouya\" structure).\nSeveral Sandjet perforating runs may or may not be required to perforate additional sands depending on the outcome of the initial perforating results.\nInterval objectives for MOU-3\n\u00b7\nTGB-6 and Ma Sand (\"middle sequence\") will be perforated over a gross interval of 80 metres with initially 13 perforating points.\n\u00b7\nEstimates of potential gas resources for this interval are as previously defined in the Independent Technical Report (\"ITR\") dated 24 January 2024 by Scorpion Geoscience Limited.\n\u00b7\nSubject to successful gas flow at commercial gas flow rates and confirmation of connected volumes, the middle sequence may potentially support a CNG gas profile of between 10 to 20 million cf/day.\n\u00b7\nTGB-4 (\"lower sequence\") will be perforated first over a gross interval of 24 metres with 4 perforating points.\n\u00b7\nEstimates of potential gas resources for this interval were previously defined in the SLR Consulting Limited Competent Persons Report dated March 2019 and have not changed.\n\u00b7\nThis is a higher risk perforating target as the potential stratigraphic trapping mechanism defined by stronger seismic amplitudes supported by recent seismic inversion modelling has yet to be validated by a successful gas flow test in MOU-3.\n\u00b7\nSubject to a successful commercial gas flow rate and confirmation of connected volumes this lower sequence may potentially support future scaling up of the CNG gas profile to 50 million cf/day facilitated by the Collaboration Agreement with Afriquia Gaz.\nFollowing completion of the MOU-3 rigless well testing a decision will be made to move to either MOU-1 or MOU-4 next to perforate the TGB-2 Sand and the Moulouya Fan sequence respectively.\nA carbonate interval in MOU-4 has also been selected for possible perforating with Sandjet in order to calibrate the NuTech petrophysical log interpretation over this interval which is located at the extreme edge of the Jurassic structure to be tested by MOU-5.\nJurassic MOU-5 well (\"Titanosaurus structure\")\n\u00b7\nThe MOU-5 well will now commence drilling as soon as practical after entry into the First Extension Period following the unforeseen delay to the scheduling of the Star Valley rig 101 programme due to other commitments.\n\u00b7\nThe Titanosaurus structure covers an area of up to 187 km2 and has up to 289 metres of vertical relief.

This is a deeper well to approximately 1,800 feet which is expected to take two weeks to drill on current pre-drill forecasting. The primary objectives are two zones from which good legacy production was achieved.\nOn completion of BON-18 drilling operations and the tie in of new production the NABI drilling rig moves on to the exploratory well BON-19. This BON-19 well will be the proof of concept for the very shallow BON-14 (\"Saffron\") trend. The Company anticipates that between 5 and 7 shallow development wells will be drilled following this trend such that upon completion of this phase of drilling operations in the Bonasse field between 200 and 300 bopd of new production will be added through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nIn the Goudron field a 6-8 Heavy Workover Program shall commence by next month, with the expectation of yielding an additional 100 bopd of new production through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nThis additional production shall be supplemental to, and contemporaneous with, with the main Snowcap-3 appraisal and development well programme in the Cory Moruga Block forecast to commence in Q2 2026.\nCommencement of BON-18 drilling operations\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"We are entering an intense period of operational activity over the next 3 months in Trinidad which at the end of which could potentially double our current production output.\nWe have chosen the option to fund, operate and drill the Snowcap-3 appraisal/development well on a 100% basis as our wholly owned subsidiary (T-Rex Resources) is the exclusive Operator of the Cory Moruga block, where we shall demonstrate our in-house operational capabilities to ensure we are well-placed and qualified to acquire any new attractive opportunities that may or may not become available long-term.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOAK Securities\nJerry Keen / Calvin Mann\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development. The structure penetrated by the MOU-1 and MOU-3 wells is currently defined as having the best potential for an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026. The Company is committed to partnering with entities capable of supporting a future development decision and who have already identified the opportunity as one warranting the execution of a Collaboration Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding. Moroccan gas prices are high, and the fiscal terms are some of the best in the world.\u00a0The presence of gas export infrastructure adjacent to the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure allows for a scalable gas development after initial CNG or micro-LNG gas production over time establishes ",

          "content": "Drilling has actually started in Trinidad \u2014 BON-18 is turning to the right, not just another \u201cplanned\u201d RNS. That matters. This isn\u2019t talk anymore, it\u2019s execution !! The programme laid out is material: multiple development wells at Bonasse, workovers at Goudron, and all of it feeding into Snowcap-3. Management are clearly pushing to build production first, using existing infrastructure, which is exactly what the market has been asking for. I like many believed  the placing hurt, but it\u2019s also now done. Crucially it funds this entire drilling and workover campaign while keeping 100% ownership. No farm-out, no fire sale. That tells me PG believes the upside is worth retaining. Today\u2019s action also says a lot: despite the knock, the majority of trades are buys. That doesn\u2019t look like panic, it looks like believers like me using weakness to top up ahead of results. If they deliver even the lower end of the forecast 300\u2013400 bopd uplift, the current valuation looks very tight. Results now matter more than words and we are finally moving into a results phase. Just my take, but this feels like positioning before news, not the end of the story.",

Existing production is currently 387. Forecasted production 350/400. That makes 737/787bopd. (This is without snowcap 3). That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks. Let that sink in. The scale of growth is impressive and will continue to add real value. PG has set up an excellent money earner with NABI. The one financial downside is  the deal with the operator. It made perfect business sense at the time to let them take the initial development risk. It was a win, win for both sides. However yesterday's fund raise shows a change in direction where Predator will not share the bigger prizes like Snowcap 3. On this drill they will take all the profit. Hence the fund raise. I can't remember what the anticipated return from snowcap 3 is? (a figure would be appreciated), but if successful, it will transform Trinidad into a solid money earning company. The main complaint with Predator is that they have promised much but delivered nothing in value. This is no longer true and the market will respond to a company making millions in oil production. Just need to see the placement shares churned. Then it's full steam ahead! This new money steam will give PG a powerful negotiating hand in Morocco.",

The parent company for Ceg bonasse as clearly laid out on page 25 is Steeldrum. The revenue is then split by the percentage ownership of Steeldrum which is 51%/49%. There is no need to email PRD it seems you are the only person struggling to grasp this. WIEGL are still liable for the costs associated with owning the leases such as the annual $50k lease costs and $50k rent for bonasse. If these are replicated in the three other licences then WIEGL are due to pay $200k whilst receiving no revenue from production. A most generous company. You have still provided zero evidence of your claims that WIEGL have waived their share in exchange for equipment etc.",

As ever the week will sell as the fudsters spread there muck around like a farmer..

NABI will commence this month drilling the deeper TPD-CD1 to 1800 feet in the Bonasse field. Goudron field: High-potential infield development well and two heavy workovers in Goudron field to commence within the next month (7th January comment). Snowcap1: Snowcap-1, drilled and tested in 2010/11, tested the topmost sand (#8 Sand). The 6-foot sand flowed at initial rates of 1100 to 1450 bopd before stabilising at a rate of 500 bopd. In the Snowcap-1 well the primary basal Herrera #1 and #2 sands were missed due to being faulted out. Snowcap 3: Drilling and testing Snowcap-3 (\"SC-3\") appraisal and development well , operated solely by the Company, will evaluate the gross 600-foot Herrea reservoir interval that contains 8 very good quality reservoirs that produced in the former BP Moruga West field x kms to the SE. SC-3 location has been selected to penetrate an unfaulted section with good potential for a thickened #1 Sand. The well is scheduled for Q2 2026 and is expected to take up to 20 days to drill and log to a depth of approximately 5300 feet. It is intended to put the well in production in Q3 2026 after drilling and testing completes. SC-3 will potentially unlock the 3P resources for the Herra #1, #2# 3 and #4 Sands of 56.9MM barrels of oil. Why the raise?: The work overs, carried out by Predator's well operator, are showing excellent returns. This is a risk free venue (to Predator) however the return is lower due to the operator taking the main financial risk. Predator have decided that on the more profitable well they are not going to let the operating drillers take the main profit. Today's decision shows that PG is confident of a successful return. 1000bopd is just a starting point The profit will now be a lot higher due to  the fund raise. The raise also gives Predator financial independence and funds to move forward. Trinidad is becoming a revenue stream with oil production increasing every month. Morocco is still ongoing. Ireland is not dead. However, this share is not for the faint hearted ! Good fortune and stay strong over the next few months.",

          "content": "I had a little chat with my AI pal as follows : Market reaction to the Predator Oil & Gas RNS this morning has been to drop the share price by around 25% , looks like news may have leaked as there was also a sharp drop yesterday afternoon prior to the rns this morning. Paul Griffiths is the largest shareholder in PRD and has seen a massive paper loss on his shareholding today. He must have known the effect the dilution would cause as this has happened several times in the past. Is this raise going to be exceptionally accretive for shareholders?  Why else would PG do this when he could have allowed NABI to conduct the drilling and just let predator take the normal revenue share? The sharp share price drop in Predator Oil & Gas (PRD) leading up to the January 20, 2026 RNS suggests the market was \"sniffing out\" a dilutive event. While a 30% drop is painful, your theory that Paul Griffiths (the largest individual shareholder at ~6.7%) is doing this for long-term accretion is backed by the specific structure of the NABI Master Services Agreement (MSA). Here is the \"Rational Investor\" breakdown of why Paul Griffiths chose dilution today over the NABI partnership for the Snowcap-3 (SC-3) well. 1. 100% Ownership vs. 30% Revenue Share The most critical reason for this raise is equity ownership of the \"Moonshot.\" The NABI Model: Under the existing MSA, NABI funds the drilling and workovers in fields like Bonasse and Goudron. In return, Predator only receives 30% of gross revenues (dropping to 15% during cost recovery). The SC-3 \"Sole Op\" Model: Today's RNS explicitly states that SC-3 will be \"operated solely by the Company.\" By raising \u00a34.5 million, Paul Griffiths is ensuring that Predator keeps 100% of the interest in the potential 56.9 million barrels of 3P resources. The Maths: If SC-3 is a hit and produces 1,000 bopd, 100% of that cash flow belongs to Predator shareholders rather than being split with a contractor. For the largest shareholder, a 15% dilution today is a small price to pay to avoid \"giving away\" 70% of the upside on the company\u2019s most valuable well.",

          "content": "Contd.... 2. Protecting the \"Major\" M&A Valuation Griffiths\u2019 commentary highlights his goal of attracting Oil Majors (BP, Shell, Exxon). Clean Assets: Majors prefer buying companies with high working interests and \"clean\" operations. If Predator had NABI funding SC-3, any potential buyer would have to negotiate with NABI to \"buy out\" their revenue share. Operational Proof: By drilling SC-3 themselves, Predator proves they have the technical and financial \"know-how\" to manage high-impact appraisal wells. This increases the \"Premium\" a Major might pay in a buyout scenario. 3. Why Now? The \"Funding Gap\" Reality While the company previously stated it was \"fully funded,\" that usually applies to minimum license commitments. Discretionary vs. Mandatory: Infill drilling like TPD CD1 is mandatory/funded via NABI. SC-3 is a discretionary appraisal. The Balance Sheet: As of mid-2025, Predator\u2019s loss widened to \u00a31.9m. With production at 387 bopd, the company is generating revenue but not yet enough \"Free Cash\" to write a \u00a33 million cheque for a 5,300-foot appraisal well. The Strategic Reset: By raising \u00a34.5m at 3.5p, Griffiths has \"reset\" the valuation but removed the financing risk. The company is now a \"funded producer\" rather than a \"starved producer.\" Summary: The Accretive Bet This raise is intended to be exceptionally accretive. Paul Griffiths has essentially \"traded\" 15% of the company's equity for the cash to keep 100% of the Snowcap prize. If SC-3 hits the #1 and #2 sands and moves 20M barrels into the 2P category, the value added to the company would be worth many times the \u00a34.5m raised. For a medium-term investor, the 3.5p entry price (post-placing) represents a valuation that essentially ignores the 57-million-barrel upside.",

If anyone cannot see that please go and post elsewhere as I will just filter you for not being able to look a gift horse in the eye.

Direct Market Purchases (Cash Outlay) These are \"on-market\" buys where he used personal funds to purchase shares at the prevailing market price: May 2023: Purchased 3,328,119 shares at 10.0p (Investment: ~\u00a3332,800). November 2022: Two purchases totaling 7,855,486 shares at an average of ~3.9p (Investment: ~\u00a3304,600). February 2020: Purchased 312,500 shares at 4.0p (Investment: ~\u00a312,500). 2. Option Exercises (Capital Injection) While options are \"incentives,\" exercising them requires the director to pay the exercise price to the company. This acts as a direct injection of cash into the business: February 2025: Exercised 18.5 million options at 5.0p (Cash paid to company: \u00a3925,000). May 2023: Exercised 7,855,486 options at 8.0p (Cash paid to company: \u00a3628,400).",

My take is somewhat positive. They've raised funds for a go it alone big hole in TT. If it hits, then that will in effect be a company maker. There appears to be no change to plans for guercif. We're 3 months in to their 6 month divestment or farm out plan. I've always maintained that I'm here until they drill a few more holes there and nothing has changed for me. I'm relatively relaxed with the share count rising the amount it has. Risk reward still works for me if they used all their allowed 500m float for this year. The fact that they only used a little over a quarter of it is also positive. Let's see where we are March/April  time and see who has the broadest grin then. Risks still remain and DYOR GLA",

For instance, 'we are fully funded,' means, 'for day to day business but if we have a chance we will go to the market for more'. You don't need to give up investing, but be very selective in the companies you chose and keep to a few so you know what is happening. Be extra wary of AIM. These are not recommendations but they are companies that will almost certainly keep up their success rate this year. Pan African resources (PAF) - gold miner. Just take a look at the chart. They pay a small dividend but in these difficult times people are buying gold in large amounts, countries are buy it - do some research on this and check out PAF, they are growing and growing with good profits. Hochschild Mining. Another brilliant gold miner. Foresight (FSG). Just gone XD and give a really good div of 6.1% today. Had a sharp fall to 400p due to excellent results which is when I bought, and is now catching up. The dividend is worth reinvesting over and over again so this is a possibility for a pension in coming years, it's a gem. You need insurance and so does just about everyone. Phoenix (PHNX) currently 7.31 dividend is a no brainer, take a look at the chart - up and up. Okay, down today due to Trump but it will fly back. I bought Chesnara (CHS) years ago and they dish out money to me twice a year with a dividend of 7.24 %at todays prices. There are loads of other like LAND, LMP, MNG, LGEN. They all seem to go up bit by bit and give excellent yields which makes investing fun. Treat companies like PRD like you would a one arm bandit, you may get lucky, you may not. Even BATS are going strong although I sold up as I had a really good run with them but I have a target to get back in as I like the quarterly dividends. All the best and have a great time getting to know some well run companies. The odd one will run aground but there's usually a warning from those in the know.",

He has the data, he knows what they produced from 6ft of sand at the top, wonder what he\u2019s extrapolating for the 594 ft beneath that gets more pressurised with every ft?

          "content": "There's nothing like a night's sleep to help look at things more objectively and try to separate the two components of investing \u2013 logic and emotion. I'm sure many reacted with negative emotion seeing a steeply discounted placing sharply reducing the holding value of their investment \u2013 I certainly did, it's not a pleasant feeling seeing your portfolio value reduced by a six-figure sum overnight.  There's also the knowledge that this will create an overhang that will take some time to clear, and that a full recovery may not happen until something material is announced. How about some logic, some basic arithmetic?  Monday lunchtime, there were 843 M fully-diluted shares (inc unexercised warrants & options), changing hands at 5.25p, giving a market capitalisation of \u00a344.3M.  That's what people thought the company was worth. By last night's close, the fully-diluted number had risen to 980.6M, and there was an additional net \u00a34.2M in the kitty.  44.3 + 4.2 = 48.5.  Divide that by 980.6, and the current share price should logically be 4.95p rather than 3.45p.  Why isn't it? \u2013 emotive response, of course. Logically, it should be a little higher than this, since the pathway to drilling Snowcap-3 is now clear, and PRD are going to receive all the income from the well, rather than sharing that with the rig owner as previously mooted. So, what will kick the share price back up to the proper level, after the placing overhang is mopped up?  After so many false starts and delayed promises, PG has finally to pull a real live rabbit out of the hat. His chances are good.  For the next six months, there are a number of potential rabbits: *  The MOU-1 / MOU-3 biogenic gas ITR we were promised Jan/Feb. *  Now a new ITR just for the TGB-6 Sands. *  A biogenic gas sourced CNG agreement; an LNG agreement; or perhaps both. *  Possible divestment of the 81km\u00b2 TGB-6 resource as a separate project. *  A larger scale Morocco divestment, for which we are over halfway through the six-month timescale. *  Snowcap-1 re-entry in March, which should include use of dewaxer and help to derisk SC-3. *  Snowcap-3 drilling & testing in April/May, connection to production Q3.  At 500-1000 bopd, that gives annual revenue of $10-20M.  Nice. Plus a few baby rabbits (kits?) to include progress in Trinidad; and potential acquisition of additional producing fields in Trinidad & Guyana.  I accept that these won't move the needle much, but are still positives. Hopefully the 'woe is me' will evaporate quickly, and be replaced \u2013 apparently for at least one person here \u2013 with the fabled 'hookers & cocaine', but as our governments like to remind us, please always copulate & inhale responsibly.",

The share price should pick up off the back of T&T production progress and drill, plus there's a reasonable chance that PG will secure a buy-in for Morocco.

          "content": "There's been several posters putting forward the idea that PRD effectively only gets 7.5% of new oil revenue and 15% of old. A bit of research shows thatt is almost certainly incorrect and we get the full 15% and 30% respectively. the Master Services Agreement (MSA) is a contract between the Parent Company (Predator Oil & Gas Holdings PLC) and NABI. Because it is a service-based royalty agreement, the money flows to the Parent before it ever reaches the \"net profit\" line of the subsidiary where the 51/49 split with WIEGL would occur.1. The Proof: Key RNS DocumentsYou can find these documents on any financial portal (Investegate, London Stock Exchange, or the PRD website). Here are the specific dates and the \"smoking gun\" quotes:RNS DateDocument TitleThe Conclusive QuoteJan 7, 2026Trinidad Increased Production\"Predator receives 30% of gross sales revenues from existing production less taxes and royalties and 15% of new production until recovery of NABI costs... Predator has no exposure to current and future field operating costs.\"Sept 1, 2025Completion of Acquisition\"In accordance with the PAFSMA, the Company [Predator] will receive 30% of gross sales receipts at the sales point... with no exposure to field operating costs.\"Dec 16, 2025End of Year Operations Update\"Predator receives 30% of gross sales revenues... after restructuring of the companies acquired in 2025. This provides for more efficient utilisation of legacy tax losses.\"2. Why it doesn't get split 51/49 with WIEGLIn the February 18, 2025 RNS (Acquisition of Challenger Assets), the structure was finalized. The reason you don't halving that 15% or 30% is due to the legal definition of the payment:The \"Top-Slice\" vs. \"Bottom-Line\": A 51/49 split applies to Dividends (money left over after all bills are paid). But the 15/30% is a Gross Revenue Share. It is taken right at the \"sales point\" (the South Erin gathering station).The Parent Contract: The MSA is held by the PLC. NABI pays the PLC a \"management fee\" (the 15/30%) in exchange for the right to operate the fields.The \"Zero-Margin\" Sub: Because NABI takes 70% and Predator takes 30% of the gross revenue, the subsidiary (Caribbean Rex) technically has zero net income from those barrels. Therefore, there is nothing for WIEGL to take 49% of in that specific transaction.3. The \"Tax Shield\" ConfirmationThe December 16, 2025 RNS also confirms that Predator uses its $48 million in tax losses against this revenue. Since those tax losses are owned by the Predator group, it further proves that the revenue is being booked by Predator. If the money were being split 51/49 at the sub-level, Predator wouldn't be able to apply its full tax shield to WIEGL's half of the money.Summary of the \"Conclusive\" RealityPredator's Take: 15% (New) / 30% (Old) of Gross Sales.WIEGL's Take: 0% of that specific 15/30% slice. They make their money by providing the services/equipment used by the JV and their \"Change of Control\" payout.The Risk: The only person losing",

Trex is PRDs holding company and for the bonasse field it bought a 51% stake in CRL which owns the bonasse field, so it is impossible to get the full 30% as they only own half of the company ie they get 15% to 7.5% of revenue. The company has clearly stated that the CEG fields are under the same terms as the Bonasse concession. The tax loss are held by Steeldrum ( formerly  Caribbean Rex ) for the bonasse and former CEG fields and not by Trex, so unsure how tax losses can be used if the revenues are not going into Steeldrum first, which PRD hold a 51% stake. Hence the 15% to 7.5% is correct. You need to stop using AL as it has thrown up two bits of misinformation in two days and start doing your own research.",

FWIW my take is the 51/49 split applies to equity,not the PAFSMA contractual royalty. The Dec 17 RNS reports $200k net revenue from $806k gross\u2014that is 25%, not the 7.5%\u201315% you are claiming. The latest RNS confirms an effective tax rate of 12.5% across the 30% share, which is only possible if PRD is utilizing its full tax shield against the entire revenue stream. WIEGL's return is via services and equipment  provided to the JVf and potentially a Change of Control payout, not the 30% top-slice royalty.Over and out from me for today. Have a good evening.",

Out of interest Bonasse has lease fees of $50k who is paying these? PRD bought a 51% stake in CEG Bonasse and other than your claims there has been nothing to indicate that the holder of the 49% stake has waived their claim to a share of the revenue.

No ones buying it, or if it lands the news will be sold anyway. Next placing is 3p or less. Its the last roll of the dice for PG. PRD needs cash and long lead items and a whole load of stuff they simply do not have. So he's gonna have to do a raise. And every time there is a rise, PG right on cue comes in with a bucket shop placing, straight to Novum or some MMs. Will be no different this time.

As ever the week will sell as the fudsters spread there muck around like a farmer..

NABI will commence this month drilling the deeper TPD-CD1 to 1800 feet in the Bonasse field. Goudron field: High-potential infield development well and two heavy workovers in Goudron field to commence within the next month (7th January comment). Snowcap1: Snowcap-1, drilled and tested in 2010/11, tested the topmost sand (#8 Sand). The 6-foot sand flowed at initial rates of 1100 to 1450 bopd before stabilising at a rate of 500 bopd. In the Snowcap-1 well the primary basal Herrera #1 and #2 sands were missed due to being faulted out. Snowcap 3: Drilling and testing Snowcap-3 (\"SC-3\") appraisal and development well , operated solely by the Company, will evaluate the gross 600-foot Herrea reservoir interval that contains 8 very good quality reservoirs that produced in the former BP Moruga West field x kms to the SE. SC-3 location has been selected to penetrate an unfaulted section with good potential for a thickened #1 Sand. The well is scheduled for Q2 2026 and is expected to take up to 20 days to drill and log to a depth of approximately 5300 feet. It is intended to put the well in production in Q3 2026 after drilling and testing completes. SC-3 will potentially unlock the 3P resources for the Herra #1, #2# 3 and #4 Sands of 56.9MM barrels of oil. Why the raise?: The work overs, carried out by Predator's well operator, are showing excellent returns. This is a risk free venue (to Predator) however the return is lower due to the operator taking the main financial risk. Predator have decided that on the more profitable well they are not going to let the operating drillers take the main profit. Today's decision shows that PG is confident of a successful return. 1000bopd is just a starting point The profit will now be a lot higher due to  the fund raise. The raise also gives Predator financial independence and funds to move forward. Trinidad is becoming a revenue stream with oil production increasing every month. Morocco is still ongoing. Ireland is not dead. However, this share is not for the faint hearted ! Good fortune and stay strong over the next few months.",

          "content": "I had a little chat with my AI pal as follows : Market reaction to the Predator Oil & Gas RNS this morning has been to drop the share price by around 25% , looks like news may have leaked as there was also a sharp drop yesterday afternoon prior to the rns this morning. Paul Griffiths is the largest shareholder in PRD and has seen a massive paper loss on his shareholding today. He must have known the effect the dilution would cause as this has happened several times in the past. Is this raise going to be exceptionally accretive for shareholders?  Why else would PG do this when he could have allowed NABI to conduct the drilling and just let predator take the normal revenue share? The sharp share price drop in Predator Oil & Gas (PRD) leading up to the January 20, 2026 RNS suggests the market was \"sniffing out\" a dilutive event. While a 30% drop is painful, your theory that Paul Griffiths (the largest individual shareholder at ~6.7%) is doing this for long-term accretion is backed by the specific structure of the NABI Master Services Agreement (MSA). Here is the \"Rational Investor\" breakdown of why Paul Griffiths chose dilution today over the NABI partnership for the Snowcap-3 (SC-3) well. 1. 100% Ownership vs. 30% Revenue Share The most critical reason for this raise is equity ownership of the \"Moonshot.\" The NABI Model: Under the existing MSA, NABI funds the drilling and workovers in fields like Bonasse and Goudron. In return, Predator only receives 30% of gross revenues (dropping to 15% during cost recovery). The SC-3 \"Sole Op\" Model: Today's RNS explicitly states that SC-3 will be \"operated solely by the Company.\" By raising \u00a34.5 million, Paul Griffiths is ensuring that Predator keeps 100% of the interest in the potential 56.9 million barrels of 3P resources. The Maths: If SC-3 is a hit and produces 1,000 bopd, 100% of that cash flow belongs to Predator shareholders rather than being split with a contractor. For the largest shareholder, a 15% dilution today is a small price to pay to avoid \"giving away\" 70% of the upside on the company\u2019s most valuable well.",

          "content": "Contd.... 2. Protecting the \"Major\" M&A Valuation Griffiths\u2019 commentary highlights his goal of attracting Oil Majors (BP, Shell, Exxon). Clean Assets: Majors prefer buying companies with high working interests and \"clean\" operations. If Predator had NABI funding SC-3, any potential buyer would have to negotiate with NABI to \"buy out\" their revenue share. Operational Proof: By drilling SC-3 themselves, Predator proves they have the technical and financial \"know-how\" to manage high-impact appraisal wells. This increases the \"Premium\" a Major might pay in a buyout scenario. 3. Why Now? The \"Funding Gap\" Reality While the company previously stated it was \"fully funded,\" that usually applies to minimum license commitments. Discretionary vs. Mandatory: Infill drilling like TPD CD1 is mandatory/funded via NABI. SC-3 is a discretionary appraisal. The Balance Sheet: As of mid-2025, Predator\u2019s loss widened to \u00a31.9m. With production at 387 bopd, the company is generating revenue but not yet enough \"Free Cash\" to write a \u00a33 million cheque for a 5,300-foot appraisal well. The Strategic Reset: By raising \u00a34.5m at 3.5p, Griffiths has \"reset\" the valuation but removed the financing risk. The company is now a \"funded producer\" rather than a \"starved producer.\" Summary: The Accretive Bet This raise is intended to be exceptionally accretive. Paul Griffiths has essentially \"traded\" 15% of the company's equity for the cash to keep 100% of the Snowcap prize. If SC-3 hits the #1 and #2 sands and moves 20M barrels into the 2P category, the value added to the company would be worth many times the \u00a34.5m raised. For a medium-term investor, the 3.5p entry price (post-placing) represents a valuation that essentially ignores the 57-million-barrel upside.",

It's a no brainer to buy  at this price with a mkt cap of only \u00a331.5m. If anyone cannot see that please go and post elsewhere as I will just filter you for not being able to look a gift horse in the eye. I do understand there are those in short term pain due to the drop but instead of whinging, BUY some more, they can move remarkably quickly. Good luck all.",

Here's what i have found on PG purchases after one quick search,  there are probably others but I can't be bothered  - 1. Direct Market Purchases (Cash Outlay) These are \"on-market\" buys where he used personal funds to purchase shares at the prevailing market price: May 2023: Purchased 3,328,119 shares at 10.0p (Investment: ~\u00a3332,800). November 2022: Two purchases totaling 7,855,486 shares at an average of ~3.9p (Investment: ~\u00a3304,600). February 2020: Purchased 312,500 shares at 4.0p (Investment: ~\u00a312,500). 2. Option Exercises (Capital Injection) While options are \"incentives,\" exercising them requires the director to pay the exercise price to the company. This acts as a direct injection of cash into the business: February 2025: Exercised 18.5 million options at 5.0p (Cash paid to company: \u00a3925,000). May 2023: Exercised 7,855,486 options at 8.0p (Cash paid to company: \u00a3628,400).",

My take is somewhat positive. They've raised funds for a go it alone big hole in TT. If it hits, then that will in effect be a company maker. There appears to be no change to plans for guercif. We're 3 months in to their 6 month divestment or farm out plan. I've always maintained that I'm here until they drill a few more holes there and nothing has changed for me. I'm relatively relaxed with the share count rising the amount it has. Risk reward still works for me if they used all their allowed 500m float for this year. The fact that they only used a little over a quarter of it is also positive. Let's see where we are March/April  time and see who has the broadest grin then. Risks still remain and DYOR GLA",

          "content": "Part 2. Hyperspectral satellite data (which I have not seen, but I trust the interpretation I have been given) shows abundant gas underground in the whole area.  This data cannot indicate the depth of the gas source, so even were there no actual gas in the Jurassic, this suggests that the underlying Triassic is gas-charged. Across N. Africa, the TAGI is one of the most prolific sources of hydrocarbons.  It was known (from the above work by PG) to be at Tendrara.  Here the main TAGI is at a depth of 2600 \u2013 2800m.  Well TE-6 shows 28m net of reservoir, TE-10 has 10m net, 110m gross.  TE-7 & TE-8 show hundreds of metres gross depth.  The problem is that at Tendrara the reservoir quality is poor, with 8% porosity, as opposed to up to 15% elsewhere.  This requires mechanical stimulation (fracking / acidizing) for commercial flow.  Interestingly, the same satellite data referred to above was ignored by SOU's James Parsons, resulting in the Tendrara drills being sub-optimally positioned. From what I can tell from the limited seismic data publicly available, the top of the Guercif Triassic is about 1000m closer to the surface than at Tendrara.  This will not only be cheaper to drill, but also likely to be less compacted, resulting in improved reservoir quality.  PG is probably the best qualified person on Earth to make that call, but I assume he has weighed up the cost : benefit potential for large, well sealed Triassic reservoirs as opposed to complex Jurassic structures, hence the change in near-term strategy. \"When the facts change, I change my mind.

The view has been expressed on here by the usual suspects that there is no gas in the Jurassic, so 'bait & switch' has moved attention somewhere else, in this case the Triassic.  I don't agree with that, although of course what follows is my own personal interpretation. Paul Griffiths has a vastly more comprehensive view of these matters \u2013 after his MSc on 'Late Mesozoic seismic sequence stratigraphy of NE Libya' he worked for the Libyan National Oil Company and Gulf Oil evaluating exactly the potential reservoirs PRD are working on today.  Later in his career he worked up the initial evaluation of the TAGI opportunity at Tendrara, 125km south of Guercif, which will be producing for Sound / Mana later this year. First, we need to understand the complexity of the Jurassic carbonate.  The Titanosaurus structure is basically a huge fossil coral reef, laid down in waters of varying depth over millions of years.  When the water was deep, sediment would mostly be fine-grained, resulting in dense rock with poor hydrocarbon reservoir potential.  In shallow water, coral reef proper would form, and this rock, already of sponge-like texture, would be further eroded by periodic exposure to the air and/or waves.  This exposure results in leached porosity development - which means what it says \u2013 increased pores and cavities resulting in excellent capacity as a hydrocarbon reservoir.  From this, it can be seen there will be vertically stacked high potential reservoirs alternating with non-productive strata.  Added to this complexity is the likelihood of horizontal variation \u2013 think of many reefs separated by infilled channels. Directly beneath the Jurassic is the top of the Triassic \u2013 marked by a thick layer of salt resulting from the evaporation of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, of which the Med forms a small remnant.  This salt acts as a very viscous liquid, moving upwards and sideways due to the pressure of overlying rock. This layer is impervious to gas, so forms an excellent seal for any gas reservoirs beneath.  However, the seismic wave conduction velocities of rock salt and carbonate reservoir are very similar, making them difficult to distinguish. The seismic data available to PRD is not that great, tbh. As a result, MOU-5 was drilled into a laterally mobilised salt layer, not carbonate reservoir.  It seems that the particular part of Titanosaurus that was drilled has been isolated from gas migration by salt above, below and laterally.  Correlation of drilled material with the seismic data has resulted in a greatly improved understanding of the structure.  There is every possibility that the structure contains multiple TCF of gas, but will require more detailed geophysical evaluation, which will cost more than PRD can afford \u2013 hence the farm in process currently underway.",

Rather like you I'm no O&G expert either, my take on your question is Predator\u2019s recent messaging emphasises the TAGI reservoirs rather than the Jurassic, not because the Jurassic has lost value but because TAGI offers a faster, lower\u2011risk route to commercial gas. TAGI wells are shallower and cheaper to drill. The Jurassic remains a large, high\u2011impact target, but drilling it requires more capital, deeper wells, and potentially a partner. By proving TAGI commerciality first, Predator strengthens its negotiating position and de\u2011risks the basin. The shift is strategic sequencing: TAGI now, Jurassic later as the transformational upside. I'm sure others will chip in with their take on it too but that's my starter for 10.",

Tight Spread = Balanced Book PRD.L traded in a very narrow range (3.40p\u20133.50p) with the mid-price barely moving. A tight spread like that usually means: Market makers were well-supplied on both sides No aggressive buyers lifting the ask No aggressive sellers hitting the bid This is classic neutral order book behaviour. \ud83d\udcc8 2. High Volume, No Price Movement = Absorption Volume was 3\u00d7 the daily average, yet the price barely moved. That strongly suggests: Large buy orders were being absorbed by resting sell liquidity, or Large sell orders were being absorbed by resting buy liquidity This is called absorption, and it\u2019s a hallmark of: Accumulation Distribution Position rotation Market makers managing inventory If this were retail-driven volume, the price would have moved more. \ud83e\uddf1 3. Likely Large Iceberg Orders When you see: High volume Flat price Tight spread \u2026it often means iceberg orders (hidden size) were sitting at key levels. Most likely: 3.40p had a large hidden buyer 3.50p had a large hidden seller This creates a \u201cvolume box\u201d where price gets trapped. \ud83d\udd04 4. Repeated Prints at the Same Price This pattern usually indicates: Market makers refreshing orders Algo participation Institutional accumulation/distribution If you saw lots of trades at 3.45p\u20133.48p, that\u2019s a sign of: VWAP algos TWAP algos Liquidity-seeking algos These keep the price pinned. \ud83e\udded 5. What This Means for Traders This type of order book behaviour usually precedes one of two things: Scenario A \u2014 Accumulation If buyers were absorbing sells: Price will break upward once the seller is cleared Volume spike with no drop is bullish Scenario B \u2014 Distribution If sellers were absorbing buys: Price will break downward once the buyer is filled Volume spike with no rise is bearish Right now, the book behaviour is neutral-to-accumulative, because: Price did not weaken despite heavy volume No sign of bid collapse No widening spreads That leans slightly bullish. \ud83c\udfaf Summary Today\u2019s Level 2 behaviour for PRD.L likely showed: Tight spreads Heavy liquidity at 3.40p and 3.50p Iceberg orders absorbing flow Market makers keeping price boxed High volume without directional movement This is classic positioning ahead of news or institutional accumulation.\u201d",

I first invested in PRD after the MOU-2 drill, so while I haven't been involved in PRD as long as some posters, I do have my fair share of scars! I've been accumulating steadily since MOU-2 and have amassed 1.3 million shares. While this may be a pittance compared to others, PRD is my largest single company investment so it matters a great deal to me and I take it seriously. Over the last several years I have been working consistently to gain a better understanding of my investment and I deeply appreciate the knowledgeable contributions of so many posters here. I am neither a financial expert or advisor nor am I an oil and gas expert, I've spent my career building software (including AI before it became the Messiah), but I love to learn and find the whole oil and gas sector utterly fascinating. My interest was first peaked during the shale boom when I was working at a cloud company in Texas and we kicked off a number of discussions with O&G producers about utilizing Permian and Eagle Ford gas to power our data centers. I realize that the sentiment here isn't great after the most recent raise. I confess to have taken it as a gut punch initially. I was expecting the next RNS to be the new ITR and based on the 17 December 2025 \"End of Year Operations Update\" I was not expecting a placement for any Trinidad operations. But any placing is only dilutive if it's not ultimately accretive. Raising money to engage in operations that have revenue potential is far different from raising money for general corporate purposes. I understand how frustrating delays can be - 2024 and 2025 tried my patience severely - but I am also a student of history, and it strikes me that oil and gas discovery, appraisal, and development is rarely the untrammeled movement from success to success. Pick a field, dig into its history, and you will see that more often than not. Now that I've pontificated enough, I'm onto my question: it seems as though the Jurassic potential is no longer being highlighted despite the fact that there may be untapped potential in other parts of the structure. Instead, the Company is focusing more on the TAGI. Would be interested to hear the opinions of others on the subject. Thanks.",

Forecasted production is an addition 350/400 bopd. That makes 737/787bopd. That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks by NABI. There will also be revenue from Snowcap 3 shortly. Testing results early Q3. The flow rate is expected to be between 500/1000 bopd, resulting in a revenue, per month, of one/two million. This revenue will not be shared with NABI and is the main reason for the fund raise. The revenue from Snowcap 3 should  quickly recover the placement money. Predator will be using their own T38 refurbished rig. There will then be 2 rigs and teams pushing on with work-overs and new drills! 2000bopd is very doable in the near future. Morocco: We await updated reports and news on negotiations January/February: An updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure. Validation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres. A fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept. Desktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well. The purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme. \u200cA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area. Nothing is certain but Predator are moving forward with confidence. There will be a few weeks of churning the placement shares. The unwashed  will do their best to spread panic and fear. However, the reality is: The future is looking really encouraging.with real progress being made on a daily basis.",

Following Admission, the Company has 814,857,814 ordinary shares of no par value in issue Am I correct that if the 9,000,000 Broker warrants are exercised before Jan 2029 then PRD will receive \u00a3315,000 and a dilution of less than 1% will occur But if, as stated in the RNS:  If 9,000,000,000,000 Broker warrants are exercised then PRD will receive \u00a3315,000,000,000 and there will be 9,000,814,857,814 in issue. Now that would be a significant dilution. I trust that it is an error, and that PG pays more attention to figures he publishes, than the creator and checker of the company\u2019s published RNSs",

Will Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Europa, said: \"FEL 4/19 contains the large 1.5 TCF, low risk Inishkea West gas prospect and is a strategic asset that can potentially provide a reliable source of low emission energy for Ireland and play a key role in the transition to renewable green power. Given the proximity to existing infrastructure, a discovery at Inishkea West could be brought online quickly and would reduce Ireland's reliance on imported gas, which carries significantly higher emissions than gas from Inishkea West would.\"",

This data cannot indicate the depth of the gas source, so even were there no actual gas in the Jurassic, this suggests that the underlying Triassic is gas-charged. Across N. Africa, the TAGI is one of the most prolific sources of hydrocarbons.  It was known (from the above work by PG) to be at Tendrara.  Here the main TAGI is at a depth of 2600 \u2013 2800m.  Well TE-6 shows 28m net of reservoir, TE-10 has 10m net, 110m gross.  TE-7 & TE-8 show hundreds of metres gross depth.  The problem is that at Tendrara the reservoir quality is poor, with 8% porosity, as opposed to up to 15% elsewhere.  This requires mechanical stimulation (fracking / acidizing) for commercial flow.  Interestingly, the same satellite data referred to above was ignored by SOU's James Parsons, resulting in the Tendrara drills being sub-optimally positioned. From what I can tell from the limited seismic data publicly available, the top of the Guercif Triassic is about 1000m closer to the surface than at Tendrara.  This will not only be cheaper to drill, but also likely to be less compacted, resulting in improved reservoir quality.  PG is probably the best qualified person on Earth to make that call, but I assume he has weighed up the cost : benefit potential for large, well sealed Triassic reservoirs as opposed to complex Jurassic structures, hence the change in near-term strategy. \"When the facts change, I change my mind.

          "content": "Part 1. @MwoQ.  Great to see a new contributor, especially one asking an interesting question that I'm sure others have also wondered about. The view has been expressed on here by the usual suspects that there is no gas in the Jurassic, so 'bait & switch' has moved attention somewhere else, in this case the Triassic.  I don't agree with that, although of course what follows is my own personal interpretation. Paul Griffiths has a vastly more comprehensive view of these matters \u2013 after his MSc on 'Late Mesozoic seismic sequence stratigraphy of NE Libya' he worked for the Libyan National Oil Company and Gulf Oil evaluating exactly the potential reservoirs PRD are working on today.  Later in his career he worked up the initial evaluation of the TAGI opportunity at Tendrara, 125km south of Guercif, which will be producing for Sound / Mana later this year. First, we need to understand the complexity of the Jurassic carbonate.  The Titanosaurus structure is basically a huge fossil coral reef, laid down in waters of varying depth over millions of years.  When the water was deep, sediment would mostly be fine-grained, resulting in dense rock with poor hydrocarbon reservoir potential.  In shallow water, coral reef proper would form, and this rock, already of sponge-like texture, would be further eroded by periodic exposure to the air and/or waves.  This exposure results in leached porosity development - which means what it says \u2013 increased pores and cavities resulting in excellent capacity as a hydrocarbon reservoir.  From this, it can be seen there will be vertically stacked high potential reservoirs alternating with non-productive strata.  Added to this complexity is the likelihood of horizontal variation \u2013 think of many reefs separated by infilled channels. Directly beneath the Jurassic is the top of the Triassic \u2013 marked by a thick layer of salt resulting from the evaporation of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, of which the Med forms a small remnant.  This salt acts as a very viscous liquid, moving upwards and sideways due to the pressure of overlying rock. This layer is impervious to gas, so forms an excellent seal for any gas reservoirs beneath.  However, the seismic wave conduction velocities of rock salt and carbonate reservoir are very similar, making them difficult to distinguish. The seismic data available to PRD is not that great, tbh. As a result, MOU-5 was drilled into a laterally mobilised salt layer, not carbonate reservoir.  It seems that the particular part of Titanosaurus that was drilled has been isolated from gas migration by salt above, below and laterally.  Correlation of drilled material with the seismic data has resulted in a greatly improved understanding of the structure.  There is every possibility that the structure contains multiple TCF of gas, but will require more detailed geophysical evaluation, which will cost more than PRD can afford \u2013 hence the farm in process currently underway.",

Rather like you I'm no O&G expert either, my take on your question is Predator\u2019s recent messaging emphasises the TAGI reservoirs rather than the Jurassic, not because the Jurassic has lost value but because TAGI offers a faster, lower\u2011risk route to commercial gas. TAGI wells are shallower and cheaper to drill. The Jurassic remains a large, high\u2011impact target, but drilling it requires more capital, deeper wells, and potentially a partner. By proving TAGI commerciality first, Predator strengthens its negotiating position and de\u2011risks the basin. The shift is strategic sequencing: TAGI now, Jurassic later as the transformational upside. I'm sure others will chip in with their take on it too but that's my starter for 10.",

Tight Spread = Balanced Book PRD.L traded in a very narrow range (3.40p\u20133.50p) with the mid-price barely moving. A tight spread like that usually means: Market makers were well-supplied on both sides No aggressive buyers lifting the ask No aggressive sellers hitting the bid This is classic neutral order book behaviour. \ud83d\udcc8 2. High Volume, No Price Movement = Absorption Volume was 3\u00d7 the daily average, yet the price barely moved. That strongly suggests: Large buy orders were being absorbed by resting sell liquidity, or Large sell orders were being absorbed by resting buy liquidity This is called absorption, and it\u2019s a hallmark of: Accumulation Distribution Position rotation Market makers managing inventory If this were retail-driven volume, the price would have moved more. \ud83e\uddf1 3. Likely Large Iceberg Orders When you see: High volume Flat price Tight spread \u2026it often means iceberg orders (hidden size) were sitting at key levels. Most likely: 3.40p had a large hidden buyer 3.50p had a large hidden seller This creates a \u201cvolume box\u201d where price gets trapped. \ud83d\udd04 4. Repeated Prints at the Same Price This pattern usually indicates: Market makers refreshing orders Algo participation Institutional accumulation/distribution If you saw lots of trades at 3.45p\u20133.48p, that\u2019s a sign of: VWAP algos TWAP algos Liquidity-seeking algos These keep the price pinned. \ud83e\udded 5. What This Means for Traders This type of order book behaviour usually precedes one of two things: Scenario A \u2014 Accumulation If buyers were absorbing sells: Price will break upward once the seller is cleared Volume spike with no drop is bullish Scenario B \u2014 Distribution If sellers were absorbing buys: Price will break downward once the buyer is filled Volume spike with no rise is bearish Right now, the book behaviour is neutral-to-accumulative, because: Price did not weaken despite heavy volume No sign of bid collapse No widening spreads That leans slightly bullish. \ud83c\udfaf Summary Today\u2019s Level 2 behaviour for PRD.L likely showed: Tight spreads Heavy liquidity at 3.40p and 3.50p Iceberg orders absorbing flow Market makers keeping price boxed High volume without directional movement This is classic positioning ahead of news or institutional accumulation.\u201d",

I first invested in PRD after the MOU-2 drill, so while I haven't been involved in PRD as long as some posters, I do have my fair share of scars! I've been accumulating steadily since MOU-2 and have amassed 1.3 million shares. While this may be a pittance compared to others, PRD is my largest single company investment so it matters a great deal to me and I take it seriously. Over the last several years I have been working consistently to gain a better understanding of my investment and I deeply appreciate the knowledgeable contributions of so many posters here. I am neither a financial expert or advisor nor am I an oil and gas expert, I've spent my career building software (including AI before it became the Messiah), but I love to learn and find the whole oil and gas sector utterly fascinating. My interest was first peaked during the shale boom when I was working at a cloud company in Texas and we kicked off a number of discussions with O&G producers about utilizing Permian and Eagle Ford gas to power our data centers. I realize that the sentiment here isn't great after the most recent raise. I confess to have taken it as a gut punch initially. I was expecting the next RNS to be the new ITR and based on the 17 December 2025 \"End of Year Operations Update\" I was not expecting a placement for any Trinidad operations. But any placing is only dilutive if it's not ultimately accretive. Raising money to engage in operations that have revenue potential is far different from raising money for general corporate purposes. I understand how frustrating delays can be - 2024 and 2025 tried my patience severely - but I am also a student of history, and it strikes me that oil and gas discovery, appraisal, and development is rarely the untrammeled movement from success to success. Pick a field, dig into its history, and you will see that more often than not. Now that I've pontificated enough, I'm onto my question: it seems as though the Jurassic potential is no longer being highlighted despite the fact that there may be untapped potential in other parts of the structure. Instead, the Company is focusing more on the TAGI. Would be interested to hear the opinions of others on the subject. Thanks.",

Key takeaways post-placing Near-term work programme funded Capital raised ahead of activity, not in response to it Reduced financing overhang during an active operational period Newsflow expected across multiple operations rather than a single event Predator retains 100% ownership of Snowcap-3, maintaining full exposure to any upside The Trinidad programme is sequenced, with multiple wells and workovers planned rather than a one-off Historical flow data combined with improved well placement underpins the Snowcap-3 appraisal rationale Taken together, this shifts the focus from funding uncertainty toward execution. Before any formal appraisal outcome, investors would typically expect a sequence of operational updates rather than a single standalone result. This often includes: Initial drilling update Confirmation of spud Progress toward target depth Early operational observations, where relevant Logging and reservoir evaluation Confirmation that logs have been run Initial indications of reservoir thickness and quality Commentary that is often qualitative rather than fully quantified at first Operational / testing update Flow testing plans or results (if undertaken) Completion status Decisions around tie-in or next operational steps Interesting times ahead !",

Then i assume there is the big one Mou5. Personally i am thinking that things may have slipped (deliberately) to around early 2027 to get a maximum get out of everywhere.  Trinidad to a major hence the build up of 100% owned assets,  By then what is happening in Ireland court cases should be a lot clearer and of course the cummulation of things in Morocco and PG will be 74.",

Key takeaways post-placing Near-term work programme funded Capital raised ahead of activity, not in response to it Reduced financing overhang during an active operational period Newsflow expected across multiple operations rather than a single event Predator retains 100% ownership of Snowcap-3, maintaining full exposure to any upside The Trinidad programme is sequenced, with multiple wells and workovers planned rather than a one-off Historical flow data combined with improved well placement underpins the Snowcap-3 appraisal rationale Taken together, this shifts the focus from funding uncertainty toward execution. Before any formal appraisal outcome, investors would typically expect a sequence of operational updates rather than a single standalone result. This often includes: Initial drilling update Confirmation of spud Progress toward target depth Early operational observations, where relevant Logging and reservoir evaluation Confirmation that logs have been run Initial indications of reservoir thickness and quality Commentary that is often qualitative rather than fully quantified at first Operational / testing update Flow testing plans or results (if undertaken) Completion status Decisions around tie-in or next operational steps Interesting times ahead !",

Forecasted production is an addition 350/400 bopd. That makes 737/787bopd. That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks by NABI. There will also be revenue from Snowcap 3 shortly. Testing results early Q3. The flow rate is expected to be between 500/1000 bopd, resulting in a revenue, per month, of one/two million. This revenue will not be shared with NABI and is the main reason for the fund raise. The revenue from Snowcap 3 should  quickly recover the placement money. Predator will be using their own T38 refurbished rig. There will then be 2 rigs and teams pushing on with work-overs and new drills! 2000bopd is very doable in the near future. Morocco: We await updated reports and news on negotiations January/February: An updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure. Validation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres. A fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept. Desktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well. The purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme. \u200cA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area. Nothing is certain but Predator are moving forward with confidence. There will be a few weeks of churning the placement shares. The unwashed  will do their best to spread panic and fear. However, the reality is: The future is looking really encouraging.with real progress being made on a daily basis.",

Personally i do not engage with them because they are green boxed and i have never had so many as there are for this share.  So much time and effort is being put into trying to defend this share from the Trolls they are having to justify the unnecessary and the unwarranted.  Nobody but nobody needs to justify why they have bought into this share.  It is their business and their business alone.  Many will have done their homework and Due Dilligence and they have made their decision.  Personally i am accountable to no one but myself and  I do not expect anyone to take responsibility for my transactions.  The company cannot defend itself but i think along with many others on here that the company's actions over the few weeks will speak much louder than any words. The concentration of effort is on Morocco because we all know that this potentially the big one and i mean really big.   Personally i am not sure if i will be in long enough to go the distance.   But many will de-risk and hopefully carry on for the real pay day.  My carry through depends on size of the special dividend.   If that is a decent size then I will carry through for hopefully a full vindication.   But let us not forget there is more than one fish frying here.",

If Morocco thought there was a commercial find already, they'd have it being developed instead of waiting interminably. Qq how long since any drilling took place and how much dilution for ordinary shareholders since. Perhaps also answer this one, since the 20p raise how much have shareholders a) been diluted and b) seen value collapse and compare the average shareholder experience to holdings of PG and renumeratoion received. From review of accounts G&A isn't sufficiently granular to see who gets paid what but any contract to PG outwith his main contract should be subject to clear flagging and go through conflict review by Chair. Pretty sure none of this happens but don't worry as he tells you all clearly Its his company and he can do as he likes.",

Not a single positive  word about all the upcoming events in Morocco or Trinidad. Totally useless in content and devoid of research. My view: Continue to filter as they add nothing to my knowledge and research. They are agitators who agenda's conflicts with my reasons for reading this BB. Balanced critical analytical comments, backed up with research are welcome. But no they can't do that. It's descending into personal ego trip, showing off about how much money they are making elsewhere. It's pathic to be honest. A group of very needy people. To me they are of no value, just part of modern day life. Their posts and replies push the information posts down the page. Meanwhile the MM's continue their squeeze on the placement sellers. But they will eventually be sold. Trinidad, on its own, will shortly justify a price way higher than the current price. 1000bopd within a year, plus the potential of Snowcap driving the share to new heights on its own. 500/1000bopd forecasted. Thank you to the individual's that write normal and informative posts.",

With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1). It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation. However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply. I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2). Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period. This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3). Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play. The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4). It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5). PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago. They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row. These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes. * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party. * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed. *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6). The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

I can only assume that the same certain people have attached offensive posts to the thread, resulting in the entire thread being removed - this classic troll technique has also been used against other posters here.  The claim is then repeated and the cycle continues. A.  In response that 'I refuse to admit that MOU-5 was a duster': Why would you put an expensive wellhead on a borehole that has not initially intersected hydrocarbons?  Take a look at the top centre seismic chart on p.33 of the October presentation, and it should be obvious. 1). To further investigate the discovery of a Helium concentration of 3120 times the normal background level. 2). To appraise the intersected salt as a potential future gas storage medium, for which a separate ITR has been prepared. 3). To deepen by 1000m to delineate the boundary of the underlying 100km\u00ba anticline of Triassic TAGI sands, which are sealed by a cap of impervious salt. B.  With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1).  It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation.  However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply.  I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2).  Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period.  This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3).  Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play.  The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4).  It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5).  PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago.  They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row.  These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes.  * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party.  * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed.  *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6).  The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

Will Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Europa, said: \"FEL 4/19 contains the large 1.5 TCF, low risk Inishkea West gas prospect and is a strategic asset that can potentially provide a reliable source of low emission energy for Ireland and play a key role in the transition to renewable green power. Given the proximity to existing infrastructure, a discovery at Inishkea West could be brought online quickly and would reduce Ireland's reliance on imported gas, which carries significantly higher emissions than gas from Inishkea West would.\"",

This data cannot indicate the depth of the gas source, so even were there no actual gas in the Jurassic, this suggests that the underlying Triassic is gas-charged. Across N. Africa, the TAGI is one of the most prolific sources of hydrocarbons.  It was known (from the above work by PG) to be at Tendrara.  Here the main TAGI is at a depth of 2600 \u2013 2800m.  Well TE-6 shows 28m net of reservoir, TE-10 has 10m net, 110m gross.  TE-7 & TE-8 show hundreds of metres gross depth.  The problem is that at Tendrara the reservoir quality is poor, with 8% porosity, as opposed to up to 15% elsewhere.  This requires mechanical stimulation (fracking / acidizing) for commercial flow.  Interestingly, the same satellite data referred to above was ignored by SOU's James Parsons, resulting in the Tendrara drills being sub-optimally positioned. From what I can tell from the limited seismic data publicly available, the top of the Guercif Triassic is about 1000m closer to the surface than at Tendrara.  This will not only be cheaper to drill, but also likely to be less compacted, resulting in improved reservoir quality.  PG is probably the best qualified person on Earth to make that call, but I assume he has weighed up the cost : benefit potential for large, well sealed Triassic reservoirs as opposed to complex Jurassic structures, hence the change in near-term strategy. \"When the facts change, I change my mind.

The view has been expressed on here by the usual suspects that there is no gas in the Jurassic, so 'bait & switch' has moved attention somewhere else, in this case the Triassic.  I don't agree with that, although of course what follows is my own personal interpretation. Paul Griffiths has a vastly more comprehensive view of these matters \u2013 after his MSc on 'Late Mesozoic seismic sequence stratigraphy of NE Libya' he worked for the Libyan National Oil Company and Gulf Oil evaluating exactly the potential reservoirs PRD are working on today.  Later in his career he worked up the initial evaluation of the TAGI opportunity at Tendrara, 125km south of Guercif, which will be producing for Sound / Mana later this year. First, we need to understand the complexity of the Jurassic carbonate.  The Titanosaurus structure is basically a huge fossil coral reef, laid down in waters of varying depth over millions of years.  When the water was deep, sediment would mostly be fine-grained, resulting in dense rock with poor hydrocarbon reservoir potential.  In shallow water, coral reef proper would form, and this rock, already of sponge-like texture, would be further eroded by periodic exposure to the air and/or waves.  This exposure results in leached porosity development - which means what it says \u2013 increased pores and cavities resulting in excellent capacity as a hydrocarbon reservoir.  From this, it can be seen there will be vertically stacked high potential reservoirs alternating with non-productive strata.  Added to this complexity is the likelihood of horizontal variation \u2013 think of many reefs separated by infilled channels. Directly beneath the Jurassic is the top of the Triassic \u2013 marked by a thick layer of salt resulting from the evaporation of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, of which the Med forms a small remnant.  This salt acts as a very viscous liquid, moving upwards and sideways due to the pressure of overlying rock. This layer is impervious to gas, so forms an excellent seal for any gas reservoirs beneath.  However, the seismic wave conduction velocities of rock salt and carbonate reservoir are very similar, making them difficult to distinguish. The seismic data available to PRD is not that great, tbh. As a result, MOU-5 was drilled into a laterally mobilised salt layer, not carbonate reservoir.  It seems that the particular part of Titanosaurus that was drilled has been isolated from gas migration by salt above, below and laterally.  Correlation of drilled material with the seismic data has resulted in a greatly improved understanding of the structure.  There is every possibility that the structure contains multiple TCF of gas, but will require more detailed geophysical evaluation, which will cost more than PRD can afford \u2013 hence the farm in process currently underway.",

In my opinion, a new well will be needed north of MOU-4. TAGI target of 100 km\u00b2: 1 to 2 TCFs.

Rather like you I'm no O&G expert either, my take on your question is Predator\u2019s recent messaging emphasises the TAGI reservoirs rather than the Jurassic, not because the Jurassic has lost value but because TAGI offers a faster, lower\u2011risk route to commercial gas. TAGI wells are shallower and cheaper to drill. The Jurassic remains a large, high\u2011impact target, but drilling it requires more capital, deeper wells, and potentially a partner. By proving TAGI commerciality first, Predator strengthens its negotiating position and de\u2011risks the basin. The shift is strategic sequencing: TAGI now, Jurassic later as the transformational upside. I'm sure others will chip in with their take on it too but that's my starter for 10.",

Tight Spread = Balanced Book PRD.L traded in a very narrow range (3.40p\u20133.50p) with the mid-price barely moving. A tight spread like that usually means: Market makers were well-supplied on both sides No aggressive buyers lifting the ask No aggressive sellers hitting the bid This is classic neutral order book behaviour. \ud83d\udcc8 2. High Volume, No Price Movement = Absorption Volume was 3\u00d7 the daily average, yet the price barely moved. That strongly suggests: Large buy orders were being absorbed by resting sell liquidity, or Large sell orders were being absorbed by resting buy liquidity This is called absorption, and it\u2019s a hallmark of: Accumulation Distribution Position rotation Market makers managing inventory If this were retail-driven volume, the price would have moved more. \ud83e\uddf1 3. Likely Large Iceberg Orders When you see: High volume Flat price Tight spread \u2026it often means iceberg orders (hidden size) were sitting at key levels. Most likely: 3.40p had a large hidden buyer 3.50p had a large hidden seller This creates a \u201cvolume box\u201d where price gets trapped. \ud83d\udd04 4. Repeated Prints at the Same Price This pattern usually indicates: Market makers refreshing orders Algo participation Institutional accumulation/distribution If you saw lots of trades at 3.45p\u20133.48p, that\u2019s a sign of: VWAP algos TWAP algos Liquidity-seeking algos These keep the price pinned. \ud83e\udded 5. What This Means for Traders This type of order book behaviour usually precedes one of two things: Scenario A \u2014 Accumulation If buyers were absorbing sells: Price will break upward once the seller is cleared Volume spike with no drop is bullish Scenario B \u2014 Distribution If sellers were absorbing buys: Price will break downward once the buyer is filled Volume spike with no rise is bearish Right now, the book behaviour is neutral-to-accumulative, because: Price did not weaken despite heavy volume No sign of bid collapse No widening spreads That leans slightly bullish. \ud83c\udfaf Summary Today\u2019s Level 2 behaviour for PRD.L likely showed: Tight spreads Heavy liquidity at 3.40p and 3.50p Iceberg orders absorbing flow Market makers keeping price boxed High volume without directional movement This is classic positioning ahead of news or institutional accumulation.\u201d",

          "content": "I'm a long time lurker on this board who has decided to finally jump into the arena. I first invested in PRD after the MOU-2 drill, so while I haven't been involved in PRD as long as some posters, I do have my fair share of scars! I've been accumulating steadily since MOU-2 and have amassed 1.3 million shares. While this may be a pittance compared to others, PRD is my largest single company investment so it matters a great deal to me and I take it seriously. Over the last several years I have been working consistently to gain a better understanding of my investment and I deeply appreciate the knowledgeable contributions of so many posters here. I am neither a financial expert or advisor nor am I an oil and gas expert, I've spent my career building software (including AI before it became the Messiah), but I love to learn and find the whole oil and gas sector utterly fascinating. My interest was first peaked during the shale boom when I was working at a cloud company in Texas and we kicked off a number of discussions with O&G producers about utilizing Permian and Eagle Ford gas to power our data centers. I realize that the sentiment here isn't great after the most recent raise. I confess to have taken it as a gut punch initially. I was expecting the next RNS to be the new ITR and based on the 17 December 2025 \"End of Year Operations Update\" I was not expecting a placement for any Trinidad operations. But any placing is only dilutive if it's not ultimately accretive. Raising money to engage in operations that have revenue potential is far different from raising money for general corporate purposes. I understand how frustrating delays can be - 2024 and 2025 tried my patience severely - but I am also a student of history, and it strikes me that oil and gas discovery, appraisal, and development is rarely the untrammeled movement from success to success. Pick a field, dig into its history, and you will see that more often than not. Now that I've pontificated enough, I'm onto my question: it seems as though the Jurassic potential is no longer being highlighted despite the fact that there may be untapped potential in other parts of the structure. Instead, the Company is focusing more on the TAGI. Would be interested to hear the opinions of others on the subject. Thanks.",

Forecasted production is an addition 350/400 bopd. That makes 737/787bopd. That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks by NABI. There will also be revenue from Snowcap 3 shortly. Testing results early Q3. The flow rate is expected to be between 500/1000 bopd, resulting in a revenue, per month, of one/two million. This revenue will not be shared with NABI and is the main reason for the fund raise. The revenue from Snowcap 3 should  quickly recover the placement money. Predator will be using their own T38 refurbished rig. There will then be 2 rigs and teams pushing on with work-overs and new drills! 2000bopd is very doable in the near future. Morocco: We await updated reports and news on negotiations January/February: An updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure. Validation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres. A fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept. Desktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well. The purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme. \u200cA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area. Nothing is certain but Predator are moving forward with confidence. There will be a few weeks of churning the placement shares. The unwashed  will do their best to spread panic and fear. However, the reality is: The future is looking really encouraging.with real progress being made on a daily basis.",

          "content": "Thank you pv72,  your valuation gives us a great indication of how important Trinidad is. If we were to achieve the higher production of 1000bopd on SC-3 the revised figures would be: 1. NABI gets to 1000bopd, and we get 15% 2. SC-3  produced 1000bopd 3. We produce oil only for 300 days pa to allow for extended outages 4. Price per barrel at only $55 usd 5. PER at 10 6. $1.3=\u00a31 1150x300x55x10\u00f71.3 gives us \u00a3146m market cap which gives us a top end of  17.9p per share in a success case. So a possable 10/20 p valuation is not too far off by Q4. These figures shows why PG decided to go down the placement route. If all goes well, this year, then Trinidad should drive up the value (Fingers crossed) What then? Continue to increase production? Increase production equals increase share price....... Or.... Sell? Until SC-3 is drilled and tested we can only hope that the production will be successful. It's easy to get carried away and patience is required. But.... The figures look good, NABI are ahead of Predator's target of the end of the year. Snowcap 2 and 3 are in proven regions. Interesting times ahead.",

The rns on January 21st 2025 clearly states they bought a 51% stake in CRL whose only asset was the bonasse field and there has been no further purchase of the remaining 49% released in an rns. The rns on 21st September 2025 clearly states the Goudron, Inniss trinity and Icacos holding companies would be transferred into  CRL which was renamed Steeldrum. In exchange for this 49% of the three CEG fields the 49% partner in Steeldrum WIEGL have taken on the $4.25m of liabilities from the CEG fields. PRD will be receiving 7.5% of production from bonasse, Goudron, Inniss trinity and Icacos fields until Nabi recover the costs , then they will revert to 15%. So if Nabi hit 1000bpd PRD will be receiving 7.5% of the 700 bpd increase which is 53bpd until costs are recovered and raising to 105 bpd when this had occurred.  Just for comparison PRD paid \u00a32m for 282bpd of production to CEG, so valuations of ten times this for lower production is a bold claim. Even if the full 1000bpd is split between the two holders of Steeldrum then PRD will have 510 bpd  which is not quite twice the production they paid \u00a32m for.",

Predator receives 30% of gross sales revenues from existing production less taxes and royalties and 15% of new production until recovery of NABI costs, thereafter 30% of net sales revenues. We also have Snowcap  3 in the pipeline. This well has the potential to add 500/1000 bopd and unlike the NABI drills, this drill is financed by Predator with Predator keeping the profits. We will also be working on Snowcap 1. I'm not sure what we are expecting there. The current share price  is due to the placement price of 3.5p, with the MM's keeping it low to achieve maximum profit. Like all placement churns it will pass. I'm looking forward to receiving various RNS's, informing us of progress. The news, if positive, will add to the value. My personal opinion is that the NABI's production on its own would underpin the current share value, once the 1000 bopd target is achieved. Trinidad is an ongoing operation with multiple work overs still to undertake this year and next year? What  would the NABI work-over's and a successful SC-3 add to our share price? Is 10/20p a realistic figure? Obviously, it will depend on an successful SC-3. Just my take and I'd appreciate other posters's valuations and views. It does make today's price rather attract and may explain the troll activities at the weekend. We all like low buy-in prices! We also have news on Morocco to come.",

That alone will multiply the share price, by how much we won\u2019t know until it happens. Of course, there is every chance that none of this will be achieved but it\u2019s my opinion that it is more likely to happen. Forgetting Morocco, I believe that TT alone will be successful. Not so much the way they have gone about it now but the placing to raise the funds recently to go at SC3 alone with its huge potential it game changing in its own right. Again it\u2019s hard for me to believe that they won\u2019t be able to achieve this on their own as they already know everything they need to know about making it work by everything if they have made work so far. I believe that buying at this price is a no brainer and I\u2019m heavily invested because it believe in it. Others have their own opinion and may rightfully object but I just don\u2019t see it not coming good and I feel like it will be this year we will see a substantial change for the better. Ireland I have no belief in at all but as it stands it\u2019s not making or breaking this company. If anything there is a slim chance something will come of it but think of it as a bonus if it does and if it doesn\u2019t then so what right?",

Why would someone who supposedly has shares in the company post hundreds of times a month, always negatively, attacking the company, CEO and individuals alike? - The answer is simple\u2014they have an agenda. You'll never get a straight answer from them about why they behave this way. Instead, they'll dodge the questions, throw insults, and deflect\u2014why might that be? \u2022 Short Selling or Hedging \u2013 They could be betting against the stock, hoping negative sentiment will drive the price down. \u2022 Emotional Investing \u2013 Some investors let emotions drive their decisions. If they feel betrayed by the company, they may be airing their grievances out of disappointment. \u2022 Competitive Bias \u2013 They hold stock in another company and genuinely believe their company is superior and see the competitor as a threat. \u2022 Personal or Professional Ties \u2013 They have direct involvement with another company, leading to bias against the competitor.",

Mou-1: Formation gas shows were recorded in a shallow sand at 605 metres measured depth (\"MD\") comprising 2.35% or 19,392 ppm C1 methane. Total background, exclusively dry gas, increased from 0.6% to 1.7% (5,232 to 13,800 ppm C1) down to 1,159 metres MD. Formation gas shows of 1.8% and 3.8% (13,355 to 36,035 ppm C1) were encountered whilst drilling this section. Below 1,159 metres in the lower Guebbas and Hoot (using the stratigraphic nomenclature of the Rharb Basin) total background gas was from 0.7% to 1.5% (5,000 to 11,996 ppm C1) but with traces of heavier gases C2, C3 and C4. Formation gas shows of up to 1.67% (13,643 ppm total gases) were also recorded. Wireline logs were run from 724 to 1487.4 metres MD over the interval with gas shows. MOU-2 was drilled to 1,260 metres Measured Depth before being suspended for operational reasons for a possible later re-entry. THREE GAS samples collected whilst drilling. 100 metres of variable quality sand in primary target. MOU-3 was drilled to 1,509 metres Measured Depth and completed for rigless testing. SEVEN GAS samples collected whilst drilling. 50.5 metres of gross sand interval in primary target. Secondary targets Ma and TGB-6 sand intervals confirmed to be present and GAS- based on NuTech petrophysics and GAS samples collected whilst drilling. Ma and TGB-6 intervals correlated with MOU-1 drilled in 2021 to potentially define a single structure covering up to 21 km2. 11 metres of unexpected sand encountered at shallow depth with OVER-PRESSURISED GAS. Formation damage predicted due to necessity to drill with heavy drilling mud - to be potentially penetrated using Sandjet rigless testing technology. \u00b7 MOU-4 was drilled to 1,199 metres Measured Depth and completed for rigless testing. Unexpected 58 metres of gross M1 Sand potential reservoir interval, interpreted by NuTech as GAS-BEARING . 21 metres of gross sand in primary target with improved reservoir characteristics compared to MOU-3 and interpreted as GAS-BEARING by NuTech petrophysics.

They are unable to to analyse your post and respond with ignorance. ONHYM do not award licences. ONHYM and the company agree the terms necessary to award a licence. This was completed last year. The licence is awarded by the Energy Ministry, after sign off by the Finance Ministry. This is a contractual obligation. I am not aware of a single situation where ONHYM, or their predecessor ONAREP, has agreed licence terms then a licence is not issued. If you know of such an instance, please reference it. I have never said that a declaration of commerciality is up to Paul Griffiths \u201cto make by himself \u201c, so please do not distort my statements. I have made it crystal clear what specific events need to occur and be agreed before such declaration can be made \u2013 these constitute 3 of the 4 bullet points in my first post this morning, including commercial gas flow, a gas sales agreement and an FDP. So why suggest that I have not stated this when I have? I repeat, PG does have significant say on WHEN such declaration is made, and yes, the timing is driven by tax issues. Dr Tim Wright, FGS, FSEG, MIMMM of Scorpion Geosciences is an accredited Competent Person, meaning that he is deemed fully qualified and has direct personal experience of the necessary geological, geophysical and geotechnical aspects of this project. He is well known within the industry. It is a requirement that he has full and free access to whatever data has been generated. There is a lot of data. This same data will have been supplied to all companies and organisations (including ONHYM) for review by their own technical experts. I cannot possibly imagine that any credible potential partner would sign an agreement without doing their own very detailed Due Diligence. If there were to be significant discrepancies in their interpretation of the data compared to Scorpion's, that would be resolved by further discussion. Please detail the qualifications and experience that you have that put you in a reasonable position to question the veracity of past and forthcoming ITRs. I repeat that I had absolutely nothing to do with any 'Research Report' posted on this bulletin board. Anything I post is my own opinion, under my own name, based on publicly available information, which I usually reference. Potential investors should always check the facts behind any statement here. Please note that the Company has made it very clear that information on social media can be inadvertently or even deliberately misleading, and urged investors to rely only on statements in an RNS and the Company's official X account. I don't expect an apology - but if I said why I don't expect an apology, it would indeed be an insult, albeit a deserved one.",

Personally i do not engage with them because they are green boxed and i have never had so many as there are for this share.  So much time and effort is being put into trying to defend this share from the Trolls they are having to justify the unnecessary and the unwarranted.  Nobody but nobody needs to justify why they have bought into this share.  It is their business and their business alone.  Many will have done their homework and Due Dilligence and they have made their decision.  Personally i am accountable to no one but myself and  I do not expect anyone to take responsibility for my transactions.  The company cannot defend itself but i think along with many others on here that the company's actions over the few weeks will speak much louder than any words. The concentration of effort is on Morocco because we all know that this potentially the big one and i mean really big.   Personally i am not sure if i will be in long enough to go the distance.   But many will de-risk and hopefully carry on for the real pay day.  My carry through depends on size of the special dividend.   If that is a decent size then I will carry through for hopefully a full vindication.   But let us not forget there is more than one fish frying here.",

Qq how long since any drilling took place and how much dilution for ordinary shareholders since. Perhaps also answer this one, since the 20p raise how much have shareholders a) been diluted and b) seen value collapse and compare the average shareholder experience to holdings of PG and renumeratoion received. From review of accounts G&A isn't sufficiently granular to see who gets paid what but any contract to PG outwith his main contract should be subject to clear flagging and go through conflict review by Chair.

Not a single positive  word about all the upcoming events in Morocco or Trinidad. Totally useless in content and devoid of research. My view: Continue to filter as they add nothing to my knowledge and research. They are agitators who agenda's conflicts with my reasons for reading this BB. Balanced critical analytical comments, backed up with research are welcome. But no they can't do that. It's descending into personal ego trip, showing off about how much money they are making elsewhere. It's pathic to be honest. A group of very needy people. To me they are of no value, just part of modern day life. Their posts and replies push the information posts down the page. Meanwhile the MM's continue their squeeze on the placement sellers. But they will eventually be sold. Trinidad, on its own, will shortly justify a price way higher than the current price. 1000bopd within a year, plus the potential of Snowcap driving the share to new heights on its own. 500/1000bopd forecasted. Thank you to the individual's that write normal and informative posts.",

My responses have then been rapidly removed by lse admin. I can only assume that the same certain people have attached offensive posts to the thread, resulting in the entire thread being removed - this classic troll technique has also been used against other posters here. The claim is then repeated and the cycle continues. A. In response that 'I refuse to admit that MOU-5 was a duster': Why would you put an expensive wellhead on a borehole that has not initially intersected hydrocarbons? Take a look at the top centre seismic chart on p.33 of the October presentation, and it should be obvious. 1). To further investigate the discovery of a Helium concentration of 3120 times the normal background level. 2). To appraise the intersected salt as a potential future gas storage medium, for which a separate ITR has been prepared. 3). To deepen by 1000m to delineate the boundary of the underlying 100km\u00ba anticline of Triassic TAGI sands, which are sealed by a cap of impervious salt. B. With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1). It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation. However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply. I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2). Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period. This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3). Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play. The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4). It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5). PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago. They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row. These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes. * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party. * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed. *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6). The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

My responses have then been rapidly removed by lse admin. I can only assume that the same certain people have attached offensive posts to the thread, resulting in the entire thread being removed - this classic troll technique has also been used against other posters here. The claim is then repeated and the cycle continues. A. In response that 'I refuse to admit that MOU-5 was a duster': Why would you put an expensive wellhead on a borehole that has not initially intersected hydrocarbons? Take a look at the top centre seismic chart on p.33 of the October presentation, and it should be obvious. 1). To further investigate the discovery of a Helium concentration of 3120 times the normal background level. 2). To appraise the intersected salt as a potential future gas storage medium, for which a separate ITR has been prepared. 3). To deepen by 1000m to delineate the boundary of the underlying 100km\u00ba anticline of Triassic TAGI sands, which are sealed by a cap of impervious salt. B. With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1). It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation. However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply. I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2). Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period. This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3). Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play. The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4). It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5). PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago. They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row. These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes. * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party. * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed. *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6). The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

Let's hope we hear something similar very shortly. \"Europa Oil & Gas (Holdings) plc, the AIM quoted West Africa, UK, and Ireland and focused oil and gas exploration, development and production company, is pleased to announce that it has received confirmation from the Irish Government's Department of Climate, Energy  and the Environment that, whilst the FEL 4/19 licence Phase 1 extension application is under consideration, it remains live and in Phase 1 until the application process is concluded. Will Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Europa, said: \"FEL 4/19 contains the large 1.5 TCF, low risk Inishkea West gas prospect and is a strategic asset that can potentially provide a reliable source of low emission energy for Ireland and play a key role in the transition to renewable green power. Given the proximity to existing infrastructure, a discovery at Inishkea West could be brought online quickly and would reduce Ireland's reliance on imported gas, which carries significantly higher emissions than gas from Inishkea West would.\"",

This data cannot indicate the depth of the gas source, so even were there no actual gas in the Jurassic, this suggests that the underlying Triassic is gas-charged. Across N. Africa, the TAGI is one of the most prolific sources of hydrocarbons.  It was known (from the above work by PG) to be at Tendrara.  Here the main TAGI is at a depth of 2600 \u2013 2800m.  Well TE-6 shows 28m net of reservoir, TE-10 has 10m net, 110m gross.  TE-7 & TE-8 show hundreds of metres gross depth.  The problem is that at Tendrara the reservoir quality is poor, with 8% porosity, as opposed to up to 15% elsewhere.  This requires mechanical stimulation (fracking / acidizing) for commercial flow.  Interestingly, the same satellite data referred to above was ignored by SOU's James Parsons, resulting in the Tendrara drills being sub-optimally positioned. From what I can tell from the limited seismic data publicly available, the top of the Guercif Triassic is about 1000m closer to the surface than at Tendrara.  This will not only be cheaper to drill, but also likely to be less compacted, resulting in improved reservoir quality.  PG is probably the best qualified person on Earth to make that call, but I assume he has weighed up the cost : benefit potential for large, well sealed Triassic reservoirs as opposed to complex Jurassic structures, hence the change in near-term strategy. \"When the facts change, I change my mind.

          "content": "Part 1. @MwoQ.  Great to see a new contributor, especially one asking an interesting question that I'm sure others have also wondered about. The view has been expressed on here by the usual suspects that there is no gas in the Jurassic, so 'bait & switch' has moved attention somewhere else, in this case the Triassic.  I don't agree with that, although of course what follows is my own personal interpretation. Paul Griffiths has a vastly more comprehensive view of these matters \u2013 after his MSc on 'Late Mesozoic seismic sequence stratigraphy of NE Libya' he worked for the Libyan National Oil Company and Gulf Oil evaluating exactly the potential reservoirs PRD are working on today.  Later in his career he worked up the initial evaluation of the TAGI opportunity at Tendrara, 125km south of Guercif, which will be producing for Sound / Mana later this year. First, we need to understand the complexity of the Jurassic carbonate.  The Titanosaurus structure is basically a huge fossil coral reef, laid down in waters of varying depth over millions of years.  When the water was deep, sediment would mostly be fine-grained, resulting in dense rock with poor hydrocarbon reservoir potential.  In shallow water, coral reef proper would form, and this rock, already of sponge-like texture, would be further eroded by periodic exposure to the air and/or waves.  This exposure results in leached porosity development - which means what it says \u2013 increased pores and cavities resulting in excellent capacity as a hydrocarbon reservoir.  From this, it can be seen there will be vertically stacked high potential reservoirs alternating with non-productive strata.  Added to this complexity is the likelihood of horizontal variation \u2013 think of many reefs separated by infilled channels. Directly beneath the Jurassic is the top of the Triassic \u2013 marked by a thick layer of salt resulting from the evaporation of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, of which the Med forms a small remnant.  This salt acts as a very viscous liquid, moving upwards and sideways due to the pressure of overlying rock. This layer is impervious to gas, so forms an excellent seal for any gas reservoirs beneath.  However, the seismic wave conduction velocities of rock salt and carbonate reservoir are very similar, making them difficult to distinguish. The seismic data available to PRD is not that great, tbh. As a result, MOU-5 was drilled into a laterally mobilised salt layer, not carbonate reservoir.  It seems that the particular part of Titanosaurus that was drilled has been isolated from gas migration by salt above, below and laterally.  Correlation of drilled material with the seismic data has resulted in a greatly improved understanding of the structure.  There is every possibility that the structure contains multiple TCF of gas, but will require more detailed geophysical evaluation, which will cost more than PRD can afford \u2013 hence the farm in process currently underway.",

Rather like you I'm no O&G expert either, my take on your question is Predator\u2019s recent messaging emphasises the TAGI reservoirs rather than the Jurassic, not because the Jurassic has lost value but because TAGI offers a faster, lower\u2011risk route to commercial gas. TAGI wells are shallower and cheaper to drill. The Jurassic remains a large, high\u2011impact target, but drilling it requires more capital, deeper wells, and potentially a partner. By proving TAGI commerciality first, Predator strengthens its negotiating position and de\u2011risks the basin. The shift is strategic sequencing: TAGI now, Jurassic later as the transformational upside. I'm sure others will chip in with their take on it too but that's my starter for 10.",

What This Means for Traders This type of order book behaviour usually precedes one of two things: Scenario A \u2014 Accumulation If buyers were absorbing sells: Price will break upward once the seller is cleared Volume spike with no drop is bullish Scenario B \u2014 Distribution If sellers were absorbing buys: Price will break downward once the buyer is filled Volume spike with no rise is bearish Right now, the book behaviour is neutral-to-accumulative, because: Price did not weaken despite heavy volume No sign of bid collapse No widening spreads That leans slightly bullish. \ud83c\udfaf Summary Today\u2019s Level 2 behaviour for PRD.L likely showed: Tight spreads Heavy liquidity at 3.40p and 3.50p Iceberg orders absorbing flow Market makers keeping price boxed High volume without directional movement This is classic positioning ahead of news or institutional accumulation.\u201d",

One comment noted that the user was \"clearly underwater with his Chariot investment after 10 years\" and that the share price had collapsed significantly from its all-time highs.

          "content": "I'm a long time lurker on this board who has decided to finally jump into the arena. I first invested in PRD after the MOU-2 drill, so while I haven't been involved in PRD as long as some posters, I do have my fair share of scars! I've been accumulating steadily since MOU-2 and have amassed 1.3 million shares. While this may be a pittance compared to others, PRD is my largest single company investment so it matters a great deal to me and I take it seriously. Over the last several years I have been working consistently to gain a better understanding of my investment and I deeply appreciate the knowledgeable contributions of so many posters here. I am neither a financial expert or advisor nor am I an oil and gas expert, I've spent my career building software (including AI before it became the Messiah), but I love to learn and find the whole oil and gas sector utterly fascinating. My interest was first peaked during the shale boom when I was working at a cloud company in Texas and we kicked off a number of discussions with O&G producers about utilizing Permian and Eagle Ford gas to power our data centers. I realize that the sentiment here isn't great after the most recent raise. I confess to have taken it as a gut punch initially. I was expecting the next RNS to be the new ITR and based on the 17 December 2025 \"End of Year Operations Update\" I was not expecting a placement for any Trinidad operations. But any placing is only dilutive if it's not ultimately accretive. Raising money to engage in operations that have revenue potential is far different from raising money for general corporate purposes. I understand how frustrating delays can be - 2024 and 2025 tried my patience severely - but I am also a student of history, and it strikes me that oil and gas discovery, appraisal, and development is rarely the untrammeled movement from success to success. Pick a field, dig into its history, and you will see that more often than not. Now that I've pontificated enough, I'm onto my question: it seems as though the Jurassic potential is no longer being highlighted despite the fact that there may be untapped potential in other parts of the structure. Instead, the Company is focusing more on the TAGI. Would be interested to hear the opinions of others on the subject. Thanks.",

Forecasted production is an addition 350/400 bopd. That makes 737/787bopd. That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks by NABI. There will also be revenue from Snowcap 3 shortly. Testing results early Q3. The flow rate is expected to be between 500/1000 bopd, resulting in a revenue, per month, of one/two million. This revenue will not be shared with NABI and is the main reason for the fund raise. The revenue from Snowcap 3 should  quickly recover the placement money. Predator will be using their own T38 refurbished rig. There will then be 2 rigs and teams pushing on with work-overs and new drills! 2000bopd is very doable in the near future. Morocco: We await updated reports and news on negotiations January/February: An updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure. Validation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres. A fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept. Desktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well. The purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme. \u200cA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area. Nothing is certain but Predator are moving forward with confidence. There will be a few weeks of churning the placement shares. The unwashed  will do their best to spread panic and fear. However, the reality is: The future is looking really encouraging.with real progress being made on a daily basis.",

          "content": "22 January 2026 RNS: BON-18 commenced in Bonasse Field. Expected to take two weeks to drill. Next well BON-19 to prove up BON-14 producing trend. (Started!) 5 to 7 shallow development wells in Bonasse to follow BON-19 Bonasse field between 200 and 300 bopd of new production will be added through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements. In the Goudron field a 6-8 Heavy Workover Program shall commence by next month, with the expectation of yielding an additional 100 bopd of new production through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements. The combined programmes are forecasted to add between 300 and 400 bopd. This will be added to the current production of 387bopd. Forecast up to 1,000 bopd and 5- to 10-fold increase in monthly revenues by end 2026. This was written prior to the placement. This is just on the NABI work-over's. What is important to note is that Predator have managed to turn a poorly run Trinidad operation into a profitable one. There are still a large amount of wells available to work on. Increase production and profit are now occurring in real time and show no indication of slowing down. A valid comment was that, prior to the fund raise, we were only receiving a small percentage of the profit. This suited the initial stage as NABI took all the risks. Now, with the likes of Snowcap-3 and our own rig we can run two operations at the same time. One is a steady build up and the other a massive step up in potential revenue. If Snowcap-3 is successful then Trinidad production level should supports a share price of 10/20 p. Calculation's were shown yesterday based on anticipated figures. Trinidad has had a proven record of oil production but in recent years it was badly run. Modern technology is showing that there is profit to be made. If we can achieve 1000 bopd , plus a potential 500/1000 bopd on SC-3 in such a short time then the future, and share value potential to increase is encouraging! Trinidad, on its own, has become a reason to purchase at today's share price! Progress is happening, but we need to wait for the developments to advance to see if Predator can achieve and we will need to see real flow figures before counting our chickens. It's certainly looking encouraging.",

Let our FUD friends dissect and attempt to sow FUD on the NABI element,  which is only a small proportion of the overall TT valuation. Talk about sweating the small stuff.....if SC3 comes in, they'll be making c\u00a38 to 15m/yr. That'll fund loads of holes in guercif and beyond! Failing that we may even get regular small divis....lots of options, which is welcomed by all GLTH including me. GLA",

If we were to achieve the higher production of 1000bopd on SC-3 the revised figures would be: 1. NABI gets to 1000bopd, and we get 15% 2. SC-3  produced 1000bopd 3. We produce oil only for 300 days pa to allow for extended outages 4. Price per barrel at only $55 usd 5. PER at 10 6. $1.3=\u00a31 1150x300x55x10\u00f71.3 gives us \u00a3146m market cap which gives us a top end of  17.9p per share in a success case. So a possable 10/20 p valuation is not too far off by Q4. These figures shows why PG decided to go down the placement route. If all goes well, this year, then Trinidad should drive up the value (Fingers crossed) What then? Continue to increase production? Increase production equals increase share price....... Or.... Sell? Until SC-3 is drilled and tested we can only hope that the production will be successful. It's easy to get carried away and patience is required. But.... The figures look good, NABI are ahead of Predator's target of the end of the year. Snowcap 2 and 3 are in proven regions. Interesting times ahead.",

PRD will be receiving 7.5% of production from bonasse, Goudron, Inniss trinity and Icacos fields until Nabi recover the costs , then they will revert to 15%. So if Nabi hit 1000bpd PRD will be receiving 7.5% of the 700 bpd increase which is 53bpd until costs are recovered and raising to 105 bpd when this had occurred.  Just for comparison PRD paid \u00a32m for 282bpd of production to CEG, so valuations of ten times this for lower production is a bold claim. Even if the full 1000bpd is split between the two holders of Steeldrum then PRD will have 510 bpd  which is not quite twice the production they paid \u00a32m for.",

Predator receives 30% of gross sales revenues from existing production less taxes and royalties and 15% of new production until recovery of NABI costs, thereafter 30% of net sales revenues. We also have Snowcap  3 in the pipeline. This well has the potential to add 500/1000 bopd and unlike the NABI drills, this drill is financed by Predator with Predator keeping the profits. We will also be working on Snowcap 1. I'm not sure what we are expecting there. The current share price  is due to the placement price of 3.5p, with the MM's keeping it low to achieve maximum profit. Like all placement churns it will pass. I'm looking forward to receiving various RNS's, informing us of progress. The news, if positive, will add to the value. My personal opinion is that the NABI's production on its own would underpin the current share value, once the 1000 bopd target is achieved. Trinidad is an ongoing operation with multiple work overs still to undertake this year and next year? What  would the NABI work-over's and a successful SC-3 add to our share price? Is 10/20p a realistic figure? Obviously, it will depend on an successful SC-3. Just my take and I'd appreciate other posters's valuations and views. It does make today's price rather attract and may explain the troll activities at the weekend. We all like low buy-in prices! We also have news on Morocco to come.",

That alone will multiply the share price, by how much we won\u2019t know until it happens. Of course, there is every chance that none of this will be achieved but it\u2019s my opinion that it is more likely to happen. Forgetting Morocco, I believe that TT alone will be successful. Not so much the way they have gone about it now but the placing to raise the funds recently to go at SC3 alone with its huge potential it game changing in its own right. Again it\u2019s hard for me to believe that they won\u2019t be able to achieve this on their own as they already know everything they need to know about making it work by everything if they have made work so far. I believe that buying at this price is a no brainer and I\u2019m heavily invested because it believe in it. Others have their own opinion and may rightfully object but I just don\u2019t see it not coming good and I feel like it will be this year we will see a substantial change for the better. Ireland I have no belief in at all but as it stands it\u2019s not making or breaking this company. If anything there is a slim chance something will come of it but think of it as a bonus if it does and if it doesn\u2019t then so what right?",

Mou-1: Formation gas shows were recorded in a shallow sand at 605 metres measured depth (\"MD\") comprising 2.35% or 19,392 ppm C1 methane. Total background, exclusively dry gas, increased from 0.6% to 1.7% (5,232 to 13,800 ppm C1) down to 1,159 metres MD. Formation gas shows of 1.8% and 3.8% (13,355 to 36,035 ppm C1) were encountered whilst drilling this section. Below 1,159 metres in the lower Guebbas and Hoot (using the stratigraphic nomenclature of the Rharb Basin) total background gas was from 0.7% to 1.5% (5,000 to 11,996 ppm C1) but with traces of heavier gases C2, C3 and C4. Formation gas shows of up to 1.67% (13,643 ppm total gases) were also recorded. Wireline logs were run from 724 to 1487.4 metres MD over the interval with gas shows. MOU-2 was drilled to 1,260 metres Measured Depth before being suspended for operational reasons for a possible later re-entry. THREE GAS samples collected whilst drilling. 100 metres of variable quality sand in primary target. MOU-3 was drilled to 1,509 metres Measured Depth and completed for rigless testing. SEVEN GAS samples collected whilst drilling. 50.5 metres of gross sand interval in primary target. Secondary targets Ma and TGB-6 sand intervals confirmed to be present and GAS- based on NuTech petrophysics and GAS samples collected whilst drilling. Ma and TGB-6 intervals correlated with MOU-1 drilled in 2021 to potentially define a single structure covering up to 21 km2. 11 metres of unexpected sand encountered at shallow depth with OVER-PRESSURISED GAS. Formation damage predicted due to necessity to drill with heavy drilling mud - to be potentially penetrated using Sandjet rigless testing technology. \u00b7 MOU-4 was drilled to 1,199 metres Measured Depth and completed for rigless testing. Unexpected 58 metres of gross M1 Sand potential reservoir interval, interpreted by NuTech as GAS-BEARING . 21 metres of gross sand in primary target with improved reservoir characteristics compared to MOU-3 and interpreted as GAS-BEARING by NuTech petrophysics.

They are unable to to analyse your post and respond with ignorance. ONHYM do not award licences. ONHYM and the company agree the terms necessary to award a licence. This was completed last year. The licence is awarded by the Energy Ministry, after sign off by the Finance Ministry. This is a contractual obligation. I am not aware of a single situation where ONHYM, or their predecessor ONAREP, has agreed licence terms then a licence is not issued. If you know of such an instance, please reference it. I have never said that a declaration of commerciality is up to Paul Griffiths \u201cto make by himself \u201c, so please do not distort my statements. I have made it crystal clear what specific events need to occur and be agreed before such declaration can be made \u2013 these constitute 3 of the 4 bullet points in my first post this morning, including commercial gas flow, a gas sales agreement and an FDP. So why suggest that I have not stated this when I have? I repeat, PG does have significant say on WHEN such declaration is made, and yes, the timing is driven by tax issues. Dr Tim Wright, FGS, FSEG, MIMMM of Scorpion Geosciences is an accredited Competent Person, meaning that he is deemed fully qualified and has direct personal experience of the necessary geological, geophysical and geotechnical aspects of this project. He is well known within the industry. It is a requirement that he has full and free access to whatever data has been generated. There is a lot of data. This same data will have been supplied to all companies and organisations (including ONHYM) for review by their own technical experts. I cannot possibly imagine that any credible potential partner would sign an agreement without doing their own very detailed Due Diligence. If there were to be significant discrepancies in their interpretation of the data compared to Scorpion's, that would be resolved by further discussion. Please detail the qualifications and experience that you have that put you in a reasonable position to question the veracity of past and forthcoming ITRs. I repeat that I had absolutely nothing to do with any 'Research Report' posted on this bulletin board. Anything I post is my own opinion, under my own name, based on publicly available information, which I usually reference. Potential investors should always check the facts behind any statement here. Please note that the Company has made it very clear that information on social media can be inadvertently or even deliberately misleading, and urged investors to rely only on statements in an RNS and the Company's official X account. I don't expect an apology - but if I said why I don't expect an apology, it would indeed be an insult, albeit a deserved one.",

Personally i do not engage with them because they are green boxed and i have never had so many as there are for this share.  So much time and effort is being put into trying to defend this share from the Trolls they are having to justify the unnecessary and the unwarranted.  Nobody but nobody needs to justify why they have bought into this share.  It is their business and their business alone.  Many will have done their homework and Due Dilligence and they have made their decision.  Personally i am accountable to no one but myself and  I do not expect anyone to take responsibility for my transactions.  The company cannot defend itself but i think along with many others on here that the company's actions over the few weeks will speak much louder than any words. The concentration of effort is on Morocco because we all know that this potentially the big one and i mean really big.   Personally i am not sure if i will be in long enough to go the distance.   But many will de-risk and hopefully carry on for the real pay day.  My carry through depends on size of the special dividend.   If that is a decent size then I will carry through for hopefully a full vindication.   But let us not forget there is more than one fish frying here.",

Perhaps also answer this one, since the 20p raise how much have shareholders a) been diluted and b) seen value collapse and compare the average shareholder experience to holdings of PG and renumeratoion received. From review of accounts G&A isn't sufficiently granular to see who gets paid what but any contract to PG outwith his main contract should be subject to clear flagging and go through conflict review by Chair.

Not a single positive  word about all the upcoming events in Morocco or Trinidad. Totally useless in content and devoid of research. My view: Continue to filter as they add nothing to my knowledge and research. They are agitators who agenda's conflicts with my reasons for reading this BB. Balanced critical analytical comments, backed up with research are welcome. But no they can't do that. It's descending into personal ego trip, showing off about how much money they are making elsewhere. It's pathic to be honest. A group of very needy people. To me they are of no value, just part of modern day life. Their posts and replies push the information posts down the page. Meanwhile the MM's continue their squeeze on the placement sellers. But they will eventually be sold. Trinidad, on its own, will shortly justify a price way higher than the current price. 1000bopd within a year, plus the potential of Snowcap driving the share to new heights on its own. 500/1000bopd forecasted. Thank you to the individual's that write normal and informative posts.",

My responses have then been rapidly removed by lse admin. I can only assume that the same certain people have attached offensive posts to the thread, resulting in the entire thread being removed - this classic troll technique has also been used against other posters here. The claim is then repeated and the cycle continues. A. In response that 'I refuse to admit that MOU-5 was a duster': Why would you put an expensive wellhead on a borehole that has not initially intersected hydrocarbons? Take a look at the top centre seismic chart on p.33 of the October presentation, and it should be obvious. 1). To further investigate the discovery of a Helium concentration of 3120 times the normal background level. 2). To appraise the intersected salt as a potential future gas storage medium, for which a separate ITR has been prepared. 3). To deepen by 1000m to delineate the boundary of the underlying 100km\u00ba anticline of Triassic TAGI sands, which are sealed by a cap of impervious salt. B. With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1). It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation. However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply. I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2). Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period. This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3). Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play. The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4). It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5). PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago. They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row. These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes. * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party. * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed. *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6). The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

I can only assume that the same certain people have attached offensive posts to the thread, resulting in the entire thread being removed - this classic troll technique has also been used against other posters here. The claim is then repeated and the cycle continues. A. In response that 'I refuse to admit that MOU-5 was a duster': Why would you put an expensive wellhead on a borehole that has not initially intersected hydrocarbons? Take a look at the top centre seismic chart on p.33 of the October presentation, and it should be obvious. 1). To further investigate the discovery of a Helium concentration of 3120 times the normal background level. 2). To appraise the intersected salt as a potential future gas storage medium, for which a separate ITR has been prepared. 3). To deepen by 1000m to delineate the boundary of the underlying 100km\u00ba anticline of Triassic TAGI sands, which are sealed by a cap of impervious salt. B. With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1). It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation. However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply. I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2). Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period. This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3). Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play. The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4). It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5). PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago. They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row. These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes. * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party. * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed. *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6). The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

Will Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Europa, said: \"FEL 4/19 contains the large 1.5 TCF, low risk Inishkea West gas prospect and is a strategic asset that can potentially provide a reliable source of low emission energy for Ireland and play a key role in the transition to renewable green power. Given the proximity to existing infrastructure, a discovery at Inishkea West could be brought online quickly and would reduce Ireland's reliance on imported gas, which carries significantly higher emissions than gas from Inishkea West would.\"",

This data cannot indicate the depth of the gas source, so even were there no actual gas in the Jurassic, this suggests that the underlying Triassic is gas-charged. Across N. Africa, the TAGI is one of the most prolific sources of hydrocarbons.  It was known (from the above work by PG) to be at Tendrara.  Here the main TAGI is at a depth of 2600 \u2013 2800m.  Well TE-6 shows 28m net of reservoir, TE-10 has 10m net, 110m gross.  TE-7 & TE-8 show hundreds of metres gross depth.  The problem is that at Tendrara the reservoir quality is poor, with 8% porosity, as opposed to up to 15% elsewhere.  This requires mechanical stimulation (fracking / acidizing) for commercial flow.  Interestingly, the same satellite data referred to above was ignored by SOU's James Parsons, resulting in the Tendrara drills being sub-optimally positioned. From what I can tell from the limited seismic data publicly available, the top of the Guercif Triassic is about 1000m closer to the surface than at Tendrara.  This will not only be cheaper to drill, but also likely to be less compacted, resulting in improved reservoir quality.  PG is probably the best qualified person on Earth to make that call, but I assume he has weighed up the cost : benefit potential for large, well sealed Triassic reservoirs as opposed to complex Jurassic structures, hence the change in near-term strategy. \"When the facts change, I change my mind.

          "content": "Part 1. @MwoQ.  Great to see a new contributor, especially one asking an interesting question that I'm sure others have also wondered about. The view has been expressed on here by the usual suspects that there is no gas in the Jurassic, so 'bait & switch' has moved attention somewhere else, in this case the Triassic.  I don't agree with that, although of course what follows is my own personal interpretation. Paul Griffiths has a vastly more comprehensive view of these matters \u2013 after his MSc on 'Late Mesozoic seismic sequence stratigraphy of NE Libya' he worked for the Libyan National Oil Company and Gulf Oil evaluating exactly the potential reservoirs PRD are working on today.  Later in his career he worked up the initial evaluation of the TAGI opportunity at Tendrara, 125km south of Guercif, which will be producing for Sound / Mana later this year. First, we need to understand the complexity of the Jurassic carbonate.  The Titanosaurus structure is basically a huge fossil coral reef, laid down in waters of varying depth over millions of years.  When the water was deep, sediment would mostly be fine-grained, resulting in dense rock with poor hydrocarbon reservoir potential.  In shallow water, coral reef proper would form, and this rock, already of sponge-like texture, would be further eroded by periodic exposure to the air and/or waves.  This exposure results in leached porosity development - which means what it says \u2013 increased pores and cavities resulting in excellent capacity as a hydrocarbon reservoir.  From this, it can be seen there will be vertically stacked high potential reservoirs alternating with non-productive strata.  Added to this complexity is the likelihood of horizontal variation \u2013 think of many reefs separated by infilled channels. Directly beneath the Jurassic is the top of the Triassic \u2013 marked by a thick layer of salt resulting from the evaporation of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, of which the Med forms a small remnant.  This salt acts as a very viscous liquid, moving upwards and sideways due to the pressure of overlying rock. This layer is impervious to gas, so forms an excellent seal for any gas reservoirs beneath.  However, the seismic wave conduction velocities of rock salt and carbonate reservoir are very similar, making them difficult to distinguish. The seismic data available to PRD is not that great, tbh. As a result, MOU-5 was drilled into a laterally mobilised salt layer, not carbonate reservoir.  It seems that the particular part of Titanosaurus that was drilled has been isolated from gas migration by salt above, below and laterally.  Correlation of drilled material with the seismic data has resulted in a greatly improved understanding of the structure.  There is every possibility that the structure contains multiple TCF of gas, but will require more detailed geophysical evaluation, which will cost more than PRD can afford \u2013 hence the farm in process currently underway.",

Rather like you I'm no O&G expert either, my take on your question is Predator\u2019s recent messaging emphasises the TAGI reservoirs rather than the Jurassic, not because the Jurassic has lost value but because TAGI offers a faster, lower\u2011risk route to commercial gas. TAGI wells are shallower and cheaper to drill. The Jurassic remains a large, high\u2011impact target, but drilling it requires more capital, deeper wells, and potentially a partner. By proving TAGI commerciality first, Predator strengthens its negotiating position and de\u2011risks the basin. The shift is strategic sequencing: TAGI now, Jurassic later as the transformational upside. I'm sure others will chip in with their take on it too but that's my starter for 10.",

Tight Spread = Balanced Book PRD.L traded in a very narrow range (3.40p\u20133.50p) with the mid-price barely moving. A tight spread like that usually means: Market makers were well-supplied on both sides No aggressive buyers lifting the ask No aggressive sellers hitting the bid This is classic neutral order book behaviour. \ud83d\udcc8 2. High Volume, No Price Movement = Absorption Volume was 3\u00d7 the daily average, yet the price barely moved. That strongly suggests: Large buy orders were being absorbed by resting sell liquidity, or Large sell orders were being absorbed by resting buy liquidity This is called absorption, and it\u2019s a hallmark of: Accumulation Distribution Position rotation Market makers managing inventory If this were retail-driven volume, the price would have moved more. \ud83e\uddf1 3. Likely Large Iceberg Orders When you see: High volume Flat price Tight spread \u2026it often means iceberg orders (hidden size) were sitting at key levels. Most likely: 3.40p had a large hidden buyer 3.50p had a large hidden seller This creates a \u201cvolume box\u201d where price gets trapped. \ud83d\udd04 4. Repeated Prints at the Same Price This pattern usually indicates: Market makers refreshing orders Algo participation Institutional accumulation/distribution If you saw lots of trades at 3.45p\u20133.48p, that\u2019s a sign of: VWAP algos TWAP algos Liquidity-seeking algos These keep the price pinned. \ud83e\udded 5. What This Means for Traders This type of order book behaviour usually precedes one of two things: Scenario A \u2014 Accumulation If buyers were absorbing sells: Price will break upward once the seller is cleared Volume spike with no drop is bullish Scenario B \u2014 Distribution If sellers were absorbing buys: Price will break downward once the buyer is filled Volume spike with no rise is bearish Right now, the book behaviour is neutral-to-accumulative, because: Price did not weaken despite heavy volume No sign of bid collapse No widening spreads That leans slightly bullish. \ud83c\udfaf Summary Today\u2019s Level 2 behaviour for PRD.L likely showed: Tight spreads Heavy liquidity at 3.40p and 3.50p Iceberg orders absorbing flow Market makers keeping price boxed High volume without directional movement This is classic positioning ahead of news or institutional accumulation.\u201d",

I first invested in PRD after the MOU-2 drill, so while I haven't been involved in PRD as long as some posters, I do have my fair share of scars! I've been accumulating steadily since MOU-2 and have amassed 1.3 million shares. While this may be a pittance compared to others, PRD is my largest single company investment so it matters a great deal to me and I take it seriously. Over the last several years I have been working consistently to gain a better understanding of my investment and I deeply appreciate the knowledgeable contributions of so many posters here. I am neither a financial expert or advisor nor am I an oil and gas expert, I've spent my career building software (including AI before it became the Messiah), but I love to learn and find the whole oil and gas sector utterly fascinating. My interest was first peaked during the shale boom when I was working at a cloud company in Texas and we kicked off a number of discussions with O&G producers about utilizing Permian and Eagle Ford gas to power our data centers. I realize that the sentiment here isn't great after the most recent raise. I confess to have taken it as a gut punch initially. I was expecting the next RNS to be the new ITR and based on the 17 December 2025 \"End of Year Operations Update\" I was not expecting a placement for any Trinidad operations. But any placing is only dilutive if it's not ultimately accretive. Raising money to engage in operations that have revenue potential is far different from raising money for general corporate purposes. I understand how frustrating delays can be - 2024 and 2025 tried my patience severely - but I am also a student of history, and it strikes me that oil and gas discovery, appraisal, and development is rarely the untrammeled movement from success to success. Pick a field, dig into its history, and you will see that more often than not. Now that I've pontificated enough, I'm onto my question: it seems as though the Jurassic potential is no longer being highlighted despite the fact that there may be untapped potential in other parts of the structure. Instead, the Company is focusing more on the TAGI. Would be interested to hear the opinions of others on the subject. Thanks.",

Forecasted production is an addition 350/400 bopd. That makes 737/787bopd. That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks by NABI. There will also be revenue from Snowcap 3 shortly. Testing results early Q3. The flow rate is expected to be between 500/1000 bopd, resulting in a revenue, per month, of one/two million. This revenue will not be shared with NABI and is the main reason for the fund raise. The revenue from Snowcap 3 should  quickly recover the placement money. Predator will be using their own T38 refurbished rig. There will then be 2 rigs and teams pushing on with work-overs and new drills! 2000bopd is very doable in the near future. Morocco: We await updated reports and news on negotiations January/February: An updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure. Validation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres. A fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept. Desktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well. The purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme. \u200cA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area. Nothing is certain but Predator are moving forward with confidence. There will be a few weeks of churning the placement shares. The unwashed  will do their best to spread panic and fear. However, the reality is: The future is looking really encouraging.with real progress being made on a daily basis.",

The January 2025 presentation page 18 has Snowcap 1 starting at 200bpd falling to 75bpd after one quarter. The estimated revenue at $68 wti for the first quarter at an initial 200bpd is $600k falling to $200k in the second quarter. 500bpd for Snowcap 3 using similar figures would give q1 at $1.5m and Q2 falling to $500k, a significant decrease in the figures some are using. PRD plan on using wax treatment, the performance in T&T is unknown and the cost of the system has not been released so it is difficult to produce estimates until these are determined. https://wp-predatoroilandgas-2024.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/01/Corporate-Presentation-21-JANUARY-2025.pdf",

          "content": "Here's how the 2026 timeline shapes up based on what they've laid out (Using AI, interesting ): Q1 2026 (now \u2014 happening) -BON-18 in Bonasse started drilling 20 January, was expected to take about 2 weeks \u2014 so results from that should be imminent or possibly already in. -BON-19 exploratory well follows straight after. - Up to 12 new wells and 14 heavy workovers scheduled through H1, so this is an intense drilling period with NABI Energy-Pedia - Ongoing production updates as they work through the infield programme \u2014 expect regular RNS announcements as wells come on stream Q2 2026 \u2014 the big one - Snowcap-3 is scheduled for Q2, expected to take around 20 days to drill and log down to approximately 5,300 feet. - it's targeting those 8 Herrera reservoir sands and the 56.9m barrel 3P resource. The original Snowcap-1 well flowed at initial rates of 1,100 to 1,450 bopd before stabilising at 500 bopd , so if SC-3 hits properly it could be genuinely transformational for the production profile Q3 2026 - SC-3 is intended to be put into production in Q3 after drilling and testing completes - Morocco \u2014 targeting completion of work necessary for an Exploitation Concession application by end of Q3 , which would crystallise the value of the discovered gas at Guercif JV partnering discussions for Morocco should be progressing through this period too H2 / Year-end 2026 -The overall target is to exit 2026 at 1,000 bopd, which they estimate would generate a five to ten fold increase in monthly production revenues v $100k/month they were averaging in late 2025 - Earnings expected around April 2026 So realistically, the next few weeks should bring news on the Bonasse wells, then the real share price catalyst is Snowcap-3 results in Q2/Q3.  If SC-3 delivers anything close to what Snowcap-1 did, the production and revenue numbers change dramatically. If it disappoints, it's a very different story at 3.3p with diluted shares outstanding.",

          "content": "22 January 2026 RNS: BON-18 commenced in Bonasse Field. Expected to take two weeks to drill. Next well BON-19 to prove up BON-14 producing trend. (Started!) 5 to 7 shallow development wells in Bonasse to follow BON-19 Bonasse field between 200 and 300 bopd of new production will be added through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements. In the Goudron field a 6-8 Heavy Workover Program shall commence by next month, with the expectation of yielding an additional 100 bopd of new production through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements. The combined programmes are forecasted to add between 300 and 400 bopd. This will be added to the current production of 387bopd. Forecast up to 1,000 bopd and 5- to 10-fold increase in monthly revenues by end 2026. This was written prior to the placement. This is just on the NABI work-over's. What is important to note is that Predator have managed to turn a poorly run Trinidad operation into a profitable one. There are still a large amount of wells available to work on. Increase production and profit are now occurring in real time and show no indication of slowing down. A valid comment was that, prior to the fund raise, we were only receiving a small percentage of the profit. This suited the initial stage as NABI took all the risks. Now, with the likes of Snowcap-3 and our own rig we can run two operations at the same time. One is a steady build up and the other a massive step up in potential revenue. If Snowcap-3 is successful then Trinidad production level should supports a share price of 10/20 p. Calculation's were shown yesterday based on anticipated figures. Trinidad has had a proven record of oil production but in recent years it was badly run. Modern technology is showing that there is profit to be made. If we can achieve 1000 bopd , plus a potential 500/1000 bopd on SC-3 in such a short time then the future, and share value potential to increase is encouraging! Trinidad, on its own, has become a reason to purchase at today's share price! Progress is happening, but we need to wait for the developments to advance to see if Predator can achieve and we will need to see real flow figures before counting our chickens. It's certainly looking encouraging.",

If we were to achieve the higher production of 1000bopd on SC-3 the revised figures would be: 1. NABI gets to 1000bopd, and we get 15% 2. SC-3  produced 1000bopd 3. We produce oil only for 300 days pa to allow for extended outages 4. Price per barrel at only $55 usd 5. PER at 10 6. $1.3=\u00a31 1150x300x55x10\u00f71.3 gives us \u00a3146m market cap which gives us a top end of  17.9p per share in a success case. So a possable 10/20 p valuation is not too far off by Q4. These figures shows why PG decided to go down the placement route. If all goes well, this year, then Trinidad should drive up the value (Fingers crossed) What then? Continue to increase production? Increase production equals increase share price....... Or.... Sell? Until SC-3 is drilled and tested we can only hope that the production will be successful. It's easy to get carried away and patience is required. But.... The figures look good, NABI are ahead of Predator's target of the end of the year. Snowcap 2 and 3 are in proven regions. Interesting times ahead.",

The rns on January 21st 2025 clearly states they bought a 51% stake in CRL whose only asset was the bonasse field and there has been no further purchase of the remaining 49% released in an rns. The rns on 21st September 2025 clearly states the Goudron, Inniss trinity and Icacos holding companies would be transferred into  CRL which was renamed Steeldrum. In exchange for this 49% of the three CEG fields the 49% partner in Steeldrum WIEGL have taken on the $4.25m of liabilities from the CEG fields. PRD will be receiving 7.5% of production from bonasse, Goudron, Inniss trinity and Icacos fields until Nabi recover the costs , then they will revert to 15%. So if Nabi hit 1000bpd PRD will be receiving 7.5% of the 700 bpd increase which is 53bpd until costs are recovered and raising to 105 bpd when this had occurred.  Just for comparison PRD paid \u00a32m for 282bpd of production to CEG, so valuations of ten times this for lower production is a bold claim. Even if the full 1000bpd is split between the two holders of Steeldrum then PRD will have 510 bpd  which is not quite twice the production they paid \u00a32m for.",

Predator receives 30% of gross sales revenues from existing production less taxes and royalties and 15% of new production until recovery of NABI costs, thereafter 30% of net sales revenues. We also have Snowcap  3 in the pipeline. This well has the potential to add 500/1000 bopd and unlike the NABI drills, this drill is financed by Predator with Predator keeping the profits. We will also be working on Snowcap 1. I'm not sure what we are expecting there. The current share price  is due to the placement price of 3.5p, with the MM's keeping it low to achieve maximum profit. Like all placement churns it will pass. I'm looking forward to receiving various RNS's, informing us of progress. The news, if positive, will add to the value. My personal opinion is that the NABI's production on its own would underpin the current share value, once the 1000 bopd target is achieved. Trinidad is an ongoing operation with multiple work overs still to undertake this year and next year? What  would the NABI work-over's and a successful SC-3 add to our share price? Is 10/20p a realistic figure? Obviously, it will depend on an successful SC-3. Just my take and I'd appreciate other posters's valuations and views. It does make today's price rather attract and may explain the troll activities at the weekend. We all like low buy-in prices! We also have news on Morocco to come.",

That alone will multiply the share price, by how much we won\u2019t know until it happens. Of course, there is every chance that none of this will be achieved but it\u2019s my opinion that it is more likely to happen. Forgetting Morocco, I believe that TT alone will be successful. Not so much the way they have gone about it now but the placing to raise the funds recently to go at SC3 alone with its huge potential it game changing in its own right. Again it\u2019s hard for me to believe that they won\u2019t be able to achieve this on their own as they already know everything they need to know about making it work by everything if they have made work so far. I believe that buying at this price is a no brainer and I\u2019m heavily invested because it believe in it. Others have their own opinion and may rightfully object but I just don\u2019t see it not coming good and I feel like it will be this year we will see a substantial change for the better. Ireland I have no belief in at all but as it stands it\u2019s not making or breaking this company. If anything there is a slim chance something will come of it but think of it as a bonus if it does and if it doesn\u2019t then so what right?",

Mou-1: Formation gas shows were recorded in a shallow sand at 605 metres measured depth (\"MD\") comprising 2.35% or 19,392 ppm C1 methane. Total background, exclusively dry gas, increased from 0.6% to 1.7% (5,232 to 13,800 ppm C1) down to 1,159 metres MD. Formation gas shows of 1.8% and 3.8% (13,355 to 36,035 ppm C1) were encountered whilst drilling this section. Below 1,159 metres in the lower Guebbas and Hoot (using the stratigraphic nomenclature of the Rharb Basin) total background gas was from 0.7% to 1.5% (5,000 to 11,996 ppm C1) but with traces of heavier gases C2, C3 and C4. Formation gas shows of up to 1.67% (13,643 ppm total gases) were also recorded. Wireline logs were run from 724 to 1487.4 metres MD over the interval with gas shows. MOU-2 was drilled to 1,260 metres Measured Depth before being suspended for operational reasons for a possible later re-entry. THREE GAS samples collected whilst drilling. 100 metres of variable quality sand in primary target. MOU-3 was drilled to 1,509 metres Measured Depth and completed for rigless testing. SEVEN GAS samples collected whilst drilling. 50.5 metres of gross sand interval in primary target. Secondary targets Ma and TGB-6 sand intervals confirmed to be present and GAS- based on NuTech petrophysics and GAS samples collected whilst drilling. Ma and TGB-6 intervals correlated with MOU-1 drilled in 2021 to potentially define a single structure covering up to 21 km2. 11 metres of unexpected sand encountered at shallow depth with OVER-PRESSURISED GAS. Formation damage predicted due to necessity to drill with heavy drilling mud - to be potentially penetrated using Sandjet rigless testing technology. \u00b7 MOU-4 was drilled to 1,199 metres Measured Depth and completed for rigless testing. Unexpected 58 metres of gross M1 Sand potential reservoir interval, interpreted by NuTech as GAS-BEARING . 21 metres of gross sand in primary target with improved reservoir characteristics compared to MOU-3 and interpreted as GAS-BEARING by NuTech petrophysics. I'm looking forward to the ITR... Trinidad update soon !",

LOOK at there negative posting history repeating the same FUD, red flags etc trying to scare off new investors with things like the license is due and no extension granted and play ball or morocco wont let you import stuff for drilling...

They are unable to to analyse your post and respond with ignorance. ONHYM do not award licences. ONHYM and the company agree the terms necessary to award a licence. This was completed last year. The licence is awarded by the Energy Ministry, after sign off by the Finance Ministry. This is a contractual obligation. I am not aware of a single situation where ONHYM, or their predecessor ONAREP, has agreed licence terms then a licence is not issued. If you know of such an instance, please reference it. I have never said that a declaration of commerciality is up to Paul Griffiths \u201cto make by himself \u201c, so please do not distort my statements. I have made it crystal clear what specific events need to occur and be agreed before such declaration can be made \u2013 these constitute 3 of the 4 bullet points in my first post this morning, including commercial gas flow, a gas sales agreement and an FDP. So why suggest that I have not stated this when I have? I repeat, PG does have significant say on WHEN such declaration is made, and yes, the timing is driven by tax issues. Dr Tim Wright, FGS, FSEG, MIMMM of Scorpion Geosciences is an accredited Competent Person, meaning that he is deemed fully qualified and has direct personal experience of the necessary geological, geophysical and geotechnical aspects of this project. He is well known within the industry. It is a requirement that he has full and free access to whatever data has been generated. There is a lot of data. This same data will have been supplied to all companies and organisations (including ONHYM) for review by their own technical experts. I cannot possibly imagine that any credible potential partner would sign an agreement without doing their own very detailed Due Diligence. If there were to be significant discrepancies in their interpretation of the data compared to Scorpion's, that would be resolved by further discussion. Please detail the qualifications and experience that you have that put you in a reasonable position to question the veracity of past and forthcoming ITRs. I repeat that I had absolutely nothing to do with any 'Research Report' posted on this bulletin board. Anything I post is my own opinion, under my own name, based on publicly available information, which I usually reference. Potential investors should always check the facts behind any statement here. Please note that the Company has made it very clear that information on social media can be inadvertently or even deliberately misleading, and urged investors to rely only on statements in an RNS and the Company's official X account. I don't expect an apology - but if I said why I don't expect an apology, it would indeed be an insult, albeit a deserved one.",

Nobody but nobody needs to justify why they have bought into this share.  It is their business and their business alone.  Many will have done their homework and Due Dilligence and they have made their decision.  Personally i am accountable to no one but myself and  I do not expect anyone to take responsibility for my transactions.  The company cannot defend itself but i think along with many others on here that the company's actions over the few weeks will speak much louder than any words. The concentration of effort is on Morocco because we all know that this potentially the big one and i mean really big.   Personally i am not sure if i will be in long enough to go the distance.   But many will de-risk and hopefully carry on for the real pay day.  My carry through depends on size of the special dividend.   If that is a decent size then I will carry through for hopefully a full vindication.   But let us not forget there is more than one fish frying here.",

Qq how long since any drilling took place and how much dilution for ordinary shareholders since. Perhaps also answer this one, since the 20p raise how much have shareholders a) been diluted and b) seen value collapse and compare the average shareholder experience to holdings of PG and renumeratoion received. From review of accounts G&A isn't sufficiently granular to see who gets paid what but any contract to PG outwith his main contract should be subject to clear flagging and go through conflict review by Chair.

Not a single positive  word about all the upcoming events in Morocco or Trinidad. Totally useless in content and devoid of research. My view: Continue to filter as they add nothing to my knowledge and research. They are agitators who agenda's conflicts with my reasons for reading this BB. Balanced critical analytical comments, backed up with research are welcome. But no they can't do that. It's descending into personal ego trip, showing off about how much money they are making elsewhere. It's pathic to be honest. A group of very needy people. To me they are of no value, just part of modern day life. Their posts and replies push the information posts down the page. Meanwhile the MM's continue their squeeze on the placement sellers. But they will eventually be sold. Trinidad, on its own, will shortly justify a price way higher than the current price. 1000bopd within a year, plus the potential of Snowcap driving the share to new heights on its own. 500/1000bopd forecasted. Thank you to the individual's that write normal and informative posts.",

It is quite clear this person has an unnatural and unhealthy obsession with PRD and none of their posts are balanced or engage in relative debate. Most people here can see the potential upside and the potential downside. We have done our research and content with our investment. If it goes the way we think it will, great! If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s a calculated loss. That\u2019s it, life goes on. Only Porters (and a few others) are constantly and consistently posting negatively here, to the point where it\u2019s now evidentially clear they have an unnecessary, unnatural and unhealthy obsession with this share.

I can only assume that the same certain people have attached offensive posts to the thread, resulting in the entire thread being removed - this classic troll technique has also been used against other posters here.  The claim is then repeated and the cycle continues. A.  In response that 'I refuse to admit that MOU-5 was a duster': Why would you put an expensive wellhead on a borehole that has not initially intersected hydrocarbons?  Take a look at the top centre seismic chart on p.33 of the October presentation, and it should be obvious. 1). To further investigate the discovery of a Helium concentration of 3120 times the normal background level. 2). To appraise the intersected salt as a potential future gas storage medium, for which a separate ITR has been prepared. 3). To deepen by 1000m to delineate the boundary of the underlying 100km\u00ba anticline of Triassic TAGI sands, which are sealed by a cap of impervious salt. B.  With reference to delaying announcement of a commercial discovery in order to maximise tax exemption benefits. 1).  It is correct that the standard ONHYM hydrocarbon contract states that the 10-year exemption from corporation tax begins upon commercialisation.  However, the situation is more nuanced than this simple statement may seem to imply.  I appreciate that nuance may be difficult for some to understand. 2).  Upon the declaration of a commercial discovery, an Exploitation Concession must then be applied for within a defined period.  This application must include timed and costed proposals to proceed to production. 3).  Moroccan Hydrocarbon Code (Law No 21-90 and Decree No 2-93-786) then come into play.  The concession can be revoked (\"d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\") for non-compliance, explicitly including \"failure to timely complete development works and start operations.\" 4).  It should be obvious that a company or its co-developers would not wish to prematurely announce a commercial discovery until it was in a position to be able to commence large scale production right from day 1, otherwise it would be losing serious amounts of tax benefits on the larger scale production likely in the later years of the exemption period. 5).  PRD could have announced a commercial discovery a long time ago.  They have not done so, and will not do so, until they have all the ducks in a row.  These include * Completed quantification of available gas volumes.  * Signed a definitive cooperation and gas sales agreement with an appropriate third party.  * Ensured that a fully costed Field Development Plan is agreed.  *The financial wherewithal and technical expertise are available to complete such an FDP. 6).  The overarching reason for delaying announcement of a commercial discovery is for maximising tax benefits.",

Will Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Europa, said: \"FEL 4/19 contains the large 1.5 TCF, low risk Inishkea West gas prospect and is a strategic asset that can potentially provide a reliable source of low emission energy for Ireland and play a key role in the transition to renewable green power. Given the proximity to existing infrastructure, a discovery at Inishkea West could be brought online quickly and would reduce Ireland's reliance on imported gas, which carries significantly higher emissions than gas from Inishkea West would.\"",

This data cannot indicate the depth of the gas source, so even were there no actual gas in the Jurassic, this suggests that the underlying Triassic is gas-charged. Across N. Africa, the TAGI is one of the most prolific sources of hydrocarbons.  It was known (from the above work by PG) to be at Tendrara.  Here the main TAGI is at a depth of 2600 \u2013 2800m.  Well TE-6 shows 28m net of reservoir, TE-10 has 10m net, 110m gross.  TE-7 & TE-8 show hundreds of metres gross depth.  The problem is that at Tendrara the reservoir quality is poor, with 8% porosity, as opposed to up to 15% elsewhere.  This requires mechanical stimulation (fracking / acidizing) for commercial flow.  Interestingly, the same satellite data referred to above was ignored by SOU's James Parsons, resulting in the Tendrara drills being sub-optimally positioned. From what I can tell from the limited seismic data publicly available, the top of the Guercif Triassic is about 1000m closer to the surface than at Tendrara.  This will not only be cheaper to drill, but also likely to be less compacted, resulting in improved reservoir quality.  PG is probably the best qualified person on Earth to make that call, but I assume he has weighed up the cost : benefit potential for large, well sealed Triassic reservoirs as opposed to complex Jurassic structures, hence the change in near-term strategy. \"When the facts change, I change my mind.

          "content": "Part 1. @MwoQ.  Great to see a new contributor, especially one asking an interesting question that I'm sure others have also wondered about. The view has been expressed on here by the usual suspects that there is no gas in the Jurassic, so 'bait & switch' has moved attention somewhere else, in this case the Triassic.  I don't agree with that, although of course what follows is my own personal interpretation. Paul Griffiths has a vastly more comprehensive view of these matters \u2013 after his MSc on 'Late Mesozoic seismic sequence stratigraphy of NE Libya' he worked for the Libyan National Oil Company and Gulf Oil evaluating exactly the potential reservoirs PRD are working on today.  Later in his career he worked up the initial evaluation of the TAGI opportunity at Tendrara, 125km south of Guercif, which will be producing for Sound / Mana later this year. First, we need to understand the complexity of the Jurassic carbonate.  The Titanosaurus structure is basically a huge fossil coral reef, laid down in waters of varying depth over millions of years.  When the water was deep, sediment would mostly be fine-grained, resulting in dense rock with poor hydrocarbon reservoir potential.  In shallow water, coral reef proper would form, and this rock, already of sponge-like texture, would be further eroded by periodic exposure to the air and/or waves.  This exposure results in leached porosity development - which means what it says \u2013 increased pores and cavities resulting in excellent capacity as a hydrocarbon reservoir.  From this, it can be seen there will be vertically stacked high potential reservoirs alternating with non-productive strata.  Added to this complexity is the likelihood of horizontal variation \u2013 think of many reefs separated by infilled channels. Directly beneath the Jurassic is the top of the Triassic \u2013 marked by a thick layer of salt resulting from the evaporation of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, of which the Med forms a small remnant.  This salt acts as a very viscous liquid, moving upwards and sideways due to the pressure of overlying rock. This layer is impervious to gas, so forms an excellent seal for any gas reservoirs beneath.  However, the seismic wave conduction velocities of rock salt and carbonate reservoir are very similar, making them difficult to distinguish. The seismic data available to PRD is not that great, tbh. As a result, MOU-5 was drilled into a laterally mobilised salt layer, not carbonate reservoir.  It seems that the particular part of Titanosaurus that was drilled has been isolated from gas migration by salt above, below and laterally.  Correlation of drilled material with the seismic data has resulted in a greatly improved understanding of the structure.  There is every possibility that the structure contains multiple TCF of gas, but will require more detailed geophysical evaluation, which will cost more than PRD can afford \u2013 hence the farm in process currently underway.",

Rather like you I'm no O&G expert either, my take on your question is Predator\u2019s recent messaging emphasises the TAGI reservoirs rather than the Jurassic, not because the Jurassic has lost value but because TAGI offers a faster, lower\u2011risk route to commercial gas. TAGI wells are shallower and cheaper to drill. The Jurassic remains a large, high\u2011impact target, but drilling it requires more capital, deeper wells, and potentially a partner. By proving TAGI commerciality first, Predator strengthens its negotiating position and de\u2011risks the basin. The shift is strategic sequencing: TAGI now, Jurassic later as the transformational upside. I'm sure others will chip in with their take on it too but that's my starter for 10.",

Tight Spread = Balanced Book PRD.L traded in a very narrow range (3.40p\u20133.50p) with the mid-price barely moving. A tight spread like that usually means: Market makers were well-supplied on both sides No aggressive buyers lifting the ask No aggressive sellers hitting the bid This is classic neutral order book behaviour. \ud83d\udcc8 2. High Volume, No Price Movement = Absorption Volume was 3\u00d7 the daily average, yet the price barely moved. That strongly suggests: Large buy orders were being absorbed by resting sell liquidity, or Large sell orders were being absorbed by resting buy liquidity This is called absorption, and it\u2019s a hallmark of: Accumulation Distribution Position rotation Market makers managing inventory If this were retail-driven volume, the price would have moved more. \ud83e\uddf1 3. Likely Large Iceberg Orders When you see: High volume Flat price Tight spread \u2026it often means iceberg orders (hidden size) were sitting at key levels.

What This Means for Traders This type of order book behaviour usually precedes one of two things: Scenario A \u2014 Accumulation If buyers were absorbing sells: Price will break upward once the seller is cleared Volume spike with no drop is bullish Scenario B \u2014 Distribution If sellers were absorbing buys: Price will break downward once the buyer is filled Volume spike with no rise is bearish Right now, the book behaviour is neutral-to-accumulative, because: Price did not weaken despite heavy volume No sign of bid collapse No widening spreads That leans slightly bullish. \ud83c\udfaf Summary Today\u2019s Level 2 behaviour for PRD.L likely showed: Tight spreads Heavy liquidity at 3.40p and 3.50p Iceberg orders absorbing flow Market makers keeping price boxed High volume without directional movement This is classic positioning ahead of news or institutional accumulation.\u201d",

Based on forum discussions, the \"pension\" is likely a reference to the user's significant, long-term investment in Chariot shares, which has performed poorly. One comment noted that the user was \"clearly underwater with his Chariot investment after 10 years\" and that the share price had collapsed significantly from its all-time highs. Therefore, \"what happened\" to the \"chariot pension\" is that the related Chariot shares suffered a major drop in value, resulting in substantial financial losses for the investor(s).\u201c",

          "content": "I'm a long time lurker on this board who has decided to finally jump into the arena. I first invested in PRD after the MOU-2 drill, so while I haven't been involved in PRD as long as some posters, I do have my fair share of scars! I've been accumulating steadily since MOU-2 and have amassed 1.3 million shares. While this may be a pittance compared to others, PRD is my largest single company investment so it matters a great deal to me and I take it seriously. Over the last several years I have been working consistently to gain a better understanding of my investment and I deeply appreciate the knowledgeable contributions of so many posters here. I am neither a financial expert or advisor nor am I an oil and gas expert, I've spent my career building software (including AI before it became the Messiah), but I love to learn and find the whole oil and gas sector utterly fascinating. My interest was first peaked during the shale boom when I was working at a cloud company in Texas and we kicked off a number of discussions with O&G producers about utilizing Permian and Eagle Ford gas to power our data centers. I realize that the sentiment here isn't great after the most recent raise. I confess to have taken it as a gut punch initially. I was expecting the next RNS to be the new ITR and based on the 17 December 2025 \"End of Year Operations Update\" I was not expecting a placement for any Trinidad operations. But any placing is only dilutive if it's not ultimately accretive. Raising money to engage in operations that have revenue potential is far different from raising money for general corporate purposes. I understand how frustrating delays can be - 2024 and 2025 tried my patience severely - but I am also a student of history, and it strikes me that oil and gas discovery, appraisal, and development is rarely the untrammeled movement from success to success. Pick a field, dig into its history, and you will see that more often than not. Now that I've pontificated enough, I'm onto my question: it seems as though the Jurassic potential is no longer being highlighted despite the fact that there may be untapped potential in other parts of the structure. Instead, the Company is focusing more on the TAGI. Would be interested to hear the opinions of others on the subject. Thanks.",

Forecasted production is an addition 350/400 bopd. That makes 737/787bopd. That's just the work over the next six to eight weeks by NABI. There will also be revenue from Snowcap 3 shortly. Testing results early Q3. The flow rate is expected to be between 500/1000 bopd, resulting in a revenue, per month, of one/two million. This revenue will not be shared with NABI and is the main reason for the fund raise. The revenue from Snowcap 3 should  quickly recover the placement money. Predator will be using their own T38 refurbished rig. There will then be 2 rigs and teams pushing on with work-overs and new drills! 2000bopd is very doable in the near future. Morocco: We await updated reports and news on negotiations January/February: An updated Independent Technical Resources report ,which will take into consideration the studies completed in 2025, is likely to uplift gas resources for the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure. Validation of the NuTech interpretation of gas saturations is also likely to significantly increase potential for prospective gas resources beyond the limits of the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure in the interval down to 950 metres. A fully-funded Environmental Impact Assessment will be commenced for a CNG/micro-LNG development together with a preliminary Front End Engineering Design concept. Desktop well design and drilling programme will be finalised for an appraisal/development well. The purpose of the fully-funded desktop work during this period is to ensure that the Company and its shareholders get the best possible mutually acceptable terms in commercial negotiations to monetise the discovered gas with the existing entities agreeing to join the Company in a potential FID and development programme. \u200cA successful application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026 will crystalise the considerable value currently assigned to the discovered gas in Guercif licence area. Nothing is certain but Predator are moving forward with confidence. There will be a few weeks of churning the placement shares. The unwashed  will do their best to spread panic and fear. However, the reality is: The future is looking really encouraging.with real progress being made on a daily basis.",

His percentage has reduced alongside other shareholders following the placing, rather than being protected or topped back up behind the scenes. Granted i know he has been rewarding himself bonuses but it doesn\u2019t mean dilution is painless , it isn\u2019t , but it does mean management are exposed to the same outcomes as us from here.
