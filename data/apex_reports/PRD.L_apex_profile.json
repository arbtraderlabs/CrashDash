This is a deeper well to approximately 1,800 feet which is expected to take two weeks to drill on current pre-drill forecasting. The primary objectives are two zones from which good legacy production was achieved.\nOn completion of BON-18 drilling operations and the tie in of new production the NABI drilling rig moves on to the exploratory well BON-19. This BON-19 well will be the proof of concept for the very shallow BON-14 (\"Saffron\") trend. The Company anticipates that between 5 and 7 shallow development wells will be drilled following this trend such that upon completion of this phase of drilling operations in the Bonasse field between 200 and 300 bopd of new production will be added through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nIn the Goudron field a 6-8 Heavy Workover Program shall commence by next month, with the expectation of yielding an additional 100 bopd of new production through existing facilities and oil sales arrangements.\nThis additional production shall be supplemental to, and contemporaneous with, with the main Snowcap-3 appraisal and development well programme in the Cory Moruga Block forecast to commence in Q2 2026.\nCommencement of BON-18 drilling operations\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"We are entering an intense period of operational activity over the next 3 months in Trinidad which at the end of which could potentially double our current production output.\nWe have chosen the option to fund, operate and drill the Snowcap-3 appraisal/development well on a 100% basis as our wholly owned subsidiary (T-Rex Resources) is the exclusive Operator of the Cory Moruga block, where we shall demonstrate our in-house operational capabilities to ensure we are well-placed and qualified to acquire any new attractive opportunities that may or may not become available long-term.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOAK Securities\nJerry Keen / Calvin Mann\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development. The structure penetrated by the MOU-1 and MOU-3 wells is currently defined as having the best potential for an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026. The Company is committed to partnering with entities capable of supporting a future development decision and who have already identified the opportunity as one warranting the execution of a Collaboration Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding. Moroccan gas prices are high, and the fiscal terms are some of the best in the world.\u00a0The presence of gas export infrastructure adjacent to the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure allows for a scalable gas development after initial CNG or micro-LNG gas production over time establishes the extent of connected gas volumes and the capability of reservoirs to deliver at plateau rates over time.\nTrinidad offers the security of a mature onshore oil province that has been producing hydrocarbons for over 50 years. Predator has assembled a portfolio of onshore producing fields with opportunities for production enhancement and additional infill development and appraisal drilling. Significant legacy tax losses, economies of scale and the application of new low-cost technologies are factors that can improve profit margins per barrel of oil produced. A Master Services Agreement with local operator NABI Construction relieves the Company of the burden and costs of operating the fields and executing drilling and heavy well workovers. In return the Company receives 30% of gross sales revenues for which it can use its acquired tax losses to substantially reduce Petroleum Profit Tax from 50% to an effective rate of 12.5%.\nPredator has an experienced technical, financial and legal management team with particular knowledge of the Moroccan and Trinidad sub-surface and operations and an ability to complete M & A transactions in Trinidad and receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner and without any unnecessary advisory fees for transactions. The Company's strategy is to operate at a much reduced overhead compared to other operators with portfolios of assets of similar extent to maintain competitiveness.\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings plc is listed on the\nEquity Shares (transition) category of the Official List of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange's\u00a0main market for listed securities\n(symbol: PRD).\nFor further information, visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The placing was completed by Albr Capital Limited and Oak Securities, acting jointly.\nThe Placing utilises some of the Company's existing ability to issue shares under the\u00a0Financial Conduct's Authority\u00a0Public Offers and Admissions to Trading Regulations.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe Proceeds of the Placing, less expenses, will be spent on:\n1. Drilling and testing Snowcap-3 (\"SC-3\") appraisal and development well , operated solely by the Company, will evaluate the gross 600-foot Herrea reservoir interval that contains 8 very good quality reservoirs that produced in the former BP Moruga West field x kms to the SE.\nSnowcap-1, drilled and tested in 2010/11, tested the topmost sand (#8 Sand). The 6-foot sand flowed at initial rates of 1100 to 1450 bopd before stabilising at a rate of 500 bopd.\nIn the Snowcap-1 well the primary basal Herrera #1 and #2 sands were missed due to being faulted out.\nSC-3 location has been selected to penetrate an unfaulted section with good potential for a thickened #1 Sand.\nThe well is scheduled for Q2 2026 and is expected to take up to 20 days to drill and log to a depth of approximately 5300 feet.\nIt is intended to put the well in production in Q3 2026 after drilling and testing completes.\nSC-3 will potentially unlock the 3P resources for the Herra #1, #2# 3 and #4 Sands of 56.9MM barrels of oil.\nThe impact on the Company's forecast production for 2026 has the potential to be transformational.\nProduction from the Company's existing fields has accreted steadily over 2 months by approximately 26% to 387 bopd following the completion of two shallow development wells and 3 heavy well workovers under our Master Services Agreement with NABI. NABI will commence this month drilling the deeper TPD-CD1 to 1800 feet in the Bonasse field.\n2. Progress joint venture partnering for the Guercif gas asset to agree principles for funding the drilling and testing of the MOU-6 well and a Phase 1 gas development contingent on the application in 2026 for an Exploitation Concession.\nSeparately complete an Independent Technical and Resources Report for the 81 km2 TGB-6 fan penetrated by MOU-3 and prepare to farmout.\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nBudgeted estimated costs (\u00a3)\nOnshore Trinidad\n1. Site preparation and permitting\n2. Drill, perforate and flow test Snowcap-3\n3. Spare back-up well inventory\n4. Construct production facilities\nSeparator, tanks, water treatment,\nvacuum truck\n50,000\n3,000,000\n100,000\n500,000\nOnshore Morocco\n5. Partnership negotiations and legal\nagreements for JV partnering\nDraft application for Exploitation Concession\n40,000\n60,000\nAdministrative\n6.\nGeneral discretionary working capital and administrative expenses\n7.\nReview and due diligence on new acquisition targets in Trinidad and surrounding areas\n300,000\n150,000\nTOTAL COSTS\n4,200,000\nCompletion of the Placing\nCompletion of the Placing is conditional on,\ninter alia\n:-\nthe Placing Shares being admitted to listing on the Equity Shares (transition) category of the Official List and to trading on the\u00a0London Stock Exchange's\u00a0main market for listed securities (\"\nAdmission\n\").\nAdmission, Settlement and Dealings in the new Placing Shares\nApplications will be made to the\u00a0London Stock Exchange for Admission\u00a0in respect of all the Placing Shares proposed to be issued on completion of the Placing. It is expected that Admission will become effective, and that dealings in the Placing Shares are expected to commence at\u00a08.00 a.m.\u00a0on or around 23 January 2026.\nThe rights attaching to the new Placing Shares will be uniform in all respects and all of the new Placing Shares will rank\npari passu\n, and form a single class for all purposes with, the existing issued shares of no par value in the Company.\nWarrants\n9,000,000 million Broker warrants are being issued exercisable at 3.5p. The Warrants have an expiry date of three years from the date of Admission.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company has\u00a0814,857,814 ordinary shares of no par value in issue, each with one vote per share (and none of which are held in treasury). The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore 814,857,814.\u00a0This figure of 814,857,814 may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for calculations to determine if they have a notifiable interest in the share capital of the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, or if such interest has changed.\nPaul Griffiths, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Predator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\u00a0commented\n:\n\"Trinidad is a re-emerging oil and gas province for the oil majors again fuelled by successes offshore Guyana and the new strategic importance of nearby Venezuela. We intend to increase further our visibility in Trinidad through advancing the drilling of SC-3.\nWe have taken this opportunity to raise funds in order to undertake additional discretionary activity, strengthening the balance sheet, and enhancing production growth. Furthermore, demonstrating our operational experience and know-how gives us greater leverage to attract oil majors into our assets at some point. The offshore Guyana petroleum system extends into our licences. The TGB-6 fan in Morocco is geologically similar to the large biogenic gas fields of the East Mediterranean. Demonstrating materiality will be an important consideration for any potential farminee but recent geo-political developments have enhanced the potential for M & A consolidation\".\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOAK Securities\nJerry Keen / Calvin Mann\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development. The structure penetrated by the MOU-1 and MOU-3 wells is currently defined as having the best potential for an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026. The Company is committed to partnering with entities capable of supporting a future development decision and who have already identified the opportunity as one warranting the execution of a Collaboration Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding. Moroccan gas prices are high, and the fiscal terms are some of the best in the world.\u00a0The presence of gas export infrastructure adjacent to the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure allows for a scalable gas development after initial CNG or micro-LNG gas production over time establishes the extent of connected gas volumes and the capability of reservoirs to deliver at plateau rates over time.\nTrinidad offers the security of a mature onshore oil province that has been producing hydrocarbons for over 50 years. Predator has assembled a portfolio of onshore producing fields with opportunities for production enhancement and additional infill development and appraisal drilling. Significant legacy tax losses, economies of scale and the application of new low-cost technologies are factors that can improve profit margins per barrel of oil produced. A Master Services Agreement with local operator NABI Construction relieves the Company of the burden and costs of operating the fields and executing drilling and heavy well workovers. In return the Company receives 30% of gross sales revenues for which it can use its acquired tax losses to substantially reduce Petroleum Profit Tax from 50% to an effective rate of 12.5%.\nPredator has an experienced technical, financial and legal management team with particular knowledge of the Moroccan and Trinidad sub-surface and operations and an ability to complete M & A transactions in Trinidad and receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner and without any unnecessary advisory fees for transactions.

We are excited about the potential production capabilities of the new well scheduled for Goudron given the unexpected higher level of production from the GY-211 well workover. We are already ahead of our production target for February 2026.\nTrinidad is part of a World Class oil and gas province that has recently assumed greater geopolitical strategic significance. The potential future re-entry of the oil majors to Venezuela could facilitate a return of larger service companies to Trinidad, thereby increasing competitiveness and access to in-country materials and services to lower drilling costs.\nOur decision to expand our footprint onshore Trinidad in 2025 has been fully justified and we look to further develop our strategic business opportunities in 2026.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development.
