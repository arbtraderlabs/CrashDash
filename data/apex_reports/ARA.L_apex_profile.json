Potential targets could range from raw materials resourcing to power generation, energy storage and recycling.\n\"The Company raised \u00a31,050,000 when it joined the Standard Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in April 2022, and is now listed in the Equity Share (Shell Companies) segment. Since the IPO the business continues to incur minimal overheads pending identification of a suitable acquisition target. This is reflected in our net loss before taxation for the six-month period of \u00a363,685 (2024: \u00a361,928 (loss)), and that at 30 June 2025, we had retained cash and bank resources of \u00a3397,000.\n\"At a time when raising capital on financial markets remains challenging due to investor scepticism and economic uncertainty, we retain our cautious approach to our first acquisition.\n\"Economic and political uncertainty continue to be significant challenges. Although interest rates have slightly decreased, inflation remains persistently above target levels and may be on the rise. While overall activity in capital markets and new issues has been low, there are signs of a recovery in the IPO market, particularly in transactions involving reverse takeovers. Secondary offerings have also been well received in sectors where both organic and acquisitive growth can be clearly demonstrated.\n\"There is a widespread recognition of the dangers of global warming and its effects on populations, habitats and landscapes. On 25 June 2025, the UK Government reaffirmed its commitment to advancing the change from fossil fuels to low-carbon, renewable energy sources, announcing a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at making Britain a 'clean energy superpower' by accelerating the adoption of energy transition technologies. However, concerns about short-term costs and energy security - often misplaced - along with a general lack of understanding of renewable energy opportunities, and occasionally political motivations, have hindered economic activity and delayed medium-term investment decisions.\n\"In view of this, and as mentioned in our 2024 Annual Report, the board decided to expand the Company's acquisition criteria beyond the global renewable energy sector supply chain, to access a wider range of potential targets. Specifically, we are exploring other industries characterised by strong macroeconomic fundamentals that have opportunities for innovation driven by new technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), where new entrants can achieve growth through acquisition and consolidation. We are encouraged by the quality and potential scalability of some of the opportunities that have been presented to us from these wider sectors.\n\"We will provide further details regarding any changes to our acquisition criteria to investors in due course, but we are currently focusing on the healthcare and life sciences markets, alongside renewable energy.\n\"We maintain our cautious approach in seeking the right transaction and are committed to ensuring that the Company and its stakeholders share in its prospects, all while closely managing overhead costs. We remain aware of our environmental, social and governance responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders, and continue to follow market best practice.\n\"I would like to thank my fellow board members and our advisers for their continued guidance and support. There is no doubt that within our team we have the skills, experience and connections to capitalise on the opportunities that exist in identifying a suitable acquisition.\"\nEnquiries\nAura Renewable Acquisitions Plc\nJohn Croft (Non-Exec Chairman)\n07785315588\nRobin Stevens (Non-Exec Director)\n07468522934\nMedia enquiries\nAllerton Communications\nPeter Curtain\n020 3633 1730\naurarenewables@allertoncomms.co.uk\nNotes to Editors\nAura was established to acquire and then act as the holding company for targeted businesses operating in the Global Renewable Energy Sector Supply Chain, particularly participants in the wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, carbon capture, waste management, smart grids and green hydrogen supply chain, and their sub-sectors. The board has subsequently decided to widen the range of high growth sectors in which the Company is seeking to identify and complete an acquisition.

On the publication of this announcement via a\u00a0Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAura Renewable Acquisitions Plc\nRegistered number 13723431\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM REPORT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nChairman's statement\nIt is my pleasure to present the unaudited interim results for Aura Renewable Acquisitions Plc (Aura or the Company) for the six months ended 30th June 2025.\nBackground\nAura was established to identify and acquire businesses operating in the renewable energy sector supply chain, particularly participants in the wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, carbon capture, waste management, smart grids and green hydrogen supply chain, and their sub-sectors. Potential targets could range from raw materials resourcing to power generation, energy storage and recycling.\nResults and activities\nThe Company raised \u00a31,050,000 when it joined the Standard Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in April 2022, and since the IPO the business continues to incur minimal overheads pending identification of a suitable acquisition target. This is reflected in our net loss before taxation for the six-month period of \u00a363,685 (2024: \u00a361,140 (loss)), and that at 30 June 2025 we had retained cash and bank resources of \u00a3397,000. On 9 December 2024, Aura announced that it had entered into heads of terms with Zero Carbon Capital Limited (\"ZCT\"), a UK incorporated company with planned battery recycling operations in Europe, which set out the key terms for Aura to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of ZCT. On further investigation and consideration, the board concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders to pursue the proposed acquisition and, as notified to the market on 15th April 2025, the Company gave notice to ZCT that the heads of terms and the discussions relating to the proposed transaction were terminated.\nMarket factors and widening of our sector focus\nAt a time when raising capital on financial markets remains challenging difficult due to investor scepticism and economic uncertainty, we retain our cautious approach to our first acquisition.\nEconomic and political uncertainty continue to be significant challenges. Although interest rates have slightly decreased, inflation remains persistently above target levels and may be on the rise. While overall activity in capital markets and new issues has been low, there are signs of a recovery in the IPO market, particularly in transactions involving reverse takeovers. Secondary offerings have also been well received in sectors where both organic and acquisitive growth can be clearly demonstrated.\nThere is a widespread recognition of the dangers of global warming and its effects on populations, habitats and landscapes.

We remain aware of our environmental, social and governance responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders, and continue to follow market best practice.\nChanges to the UK Listing Rules\nAs a consequence of the new UK Listing Rules introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority, which came into force on 29 July 2024, the Company has automatically been included in the\nshell companies' category\nof the Official List. This category imposes additional requirements, including a time limit on completing an initial transaction, the requirement to appoint a Sponsor to advise on the initial transaction and amending the Articles to incorporate provisions providing for new time limits on the first transaction described below.\nThere was a transition period of one year during which those additional requirements will not apply. As the initial acquisition was not completed within that first year, the above requirements were reflected in a change to the Company's Articles in May 2025, which stated, inter alia, that \"I\nf the Company has not completed an initial transaction during the period ending on 29\nJuly 2027 (Initial Period), it will cease operations on that date, unless Article 140.3\napplies summarised below:\n140.3. The Initial Period can be extended before the end of that period by three further periods of 12 months, up to a total of 36 months, provided that:\n\u00b7\nthe first 12-month extension to the Initial Period is approved by public shareholder majority before the end of that period; and\n\u00b7\nany further 12-month extension periods are approved by public shareholder majority before the end of the prior 12-month period.\n\u00b7\nAny such extension must be notified to a Regulatory Information Service before the end of the Initial Period or the period referred to in Article 140.3, as applicable.\"\nI would like to thank my fellow board members and our advisers for their continued guidance and support. There is no doubt that within our team we have the skills, experience and connections to capitalise on the opportunities that exist in identifying a suitable acquisition.\nJohn Croft\nNon-Executive Chairman\n2 September 2025\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Directors consider the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and a summary of the key measures taken to mitigate those risks are as follows:\nOperational risks - difficulties in acquiring suitable targets\nThe Company's strategy is dependent to a significant extent on its ability to identify sufficient suitable acquisition opportunities and to execute these transactions at a price and on terms consistent with the Company's strategy. In particular, in order to qualify for re-admission to the Official List following an acquisition, the expected aggregate market value of the issued Ordinary Shares on such re-admission would have to be at least \u00a330 million. However, it is possible that the board might decide to seek admission to the AIM Market at the time of its first acquisition, where no such size constraints exist, rather than re-join the Official List.\nIf the Company cannot identify suitable acquisitions, or successfully execute any such transactions, this will have an adverse effect on its financial and operational performance, and it will be unable to achieve its strategic objectives.\nIn the event of the completion of an acquisition, the Company will adopt a formal treasury policy which will be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on an annual basis. The treasury policy will cover all areas of treasury risk including foreign exchange, interest rate, counterparty and liquidity.\nThe success of the Company's business strategy is also dependent on the subsequent performance of the acquired entities.\nThe directors seek to manage these risks by leveraging the experience of the skill sets of the non-executive directors to prudently identify, pursue and execute on acquisition opportunities. The review of acquisition targets involves and assessment of the target's business and the markets it operates in, its business plans and management capabilities.\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe unaudited condensed interim statement of comprehensive income of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is stated below.\nNote\nSix months ended\n30 June2025\n(unaudited)\u00a3\nSix months ended\n30 June2024\n(unaudited)\u00a3\nRevenue\n-\n-\nAdministrative expenses\n6\n(66,679)\n(61,923)\nOperating loss\n(66,679)\n(61,923)\nFinance income\n8\n2,994\n783\nLoss before taxation\n(63,685)\n(61,140)\nIncome tax\n9\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period attributable to the equity holders\n(63,685)\n(61,140)\nBasic and diluted earnings per ordinary share attributable to the equity holders (\u00a3)\n10\n(0.006)\n(0.006)\nThere was no other comprehensive income in the period.

Consequently, with effect from that date, the Company has automatically been included in the shell companies' category of the Official List.\n2 Basis of preparation\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Company's condensed interim financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to the period presented, unless otherwise stated.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and International Accounting Standard 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" (IAS 34). These condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.\nThese condensed interim financial statements do not include all of the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Company's financial position and performance during the six-month period ended 30 June 2025.\nThe condensed interim financial statements are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the auditors and were approved by the board of directors on 2 September 2025.\nThe Financial Statements are presented in \u00a3 unless otherwise stated which is the Company's functional and presentational currency.\nGoing concern\nThe Financial Statements has been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.\nThe financial position of the Company, its cash flows and liquidity position are set out in these financial statements. As at 30 June 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a3396,736.\nThe Company has prepared monthly cash flow forecasts that supports the conclusion of the Directors that they expect sufficient funding to be available to meet the Company's anticipated cash flow requirements for at least the next 12 months.\n3 Significant accounting policies\nThe Company's Financial Statements are based on the following policies which have been consistently applied:\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Directors consider any cash on short-term deposits and other short-term investments to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers the credit ratings of banks in which it holds funds in order to reduce its exposure to credit risk. The Company will only keep its holdings of cash and cash equivalents within institutions which have a strong credit rating.\nTrade and other receivables\nReceivables are initially recognised at fair value when related amounts are invoiced then carried at this amount less any allowances for doubtful debts or provision made for impairment of these receivables.\nTrade and other payables\nThese financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration payable..\nFinancial instruments\nInitial recognition\nA financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the statement of financial position of the Company when it arises or when the Company becomes part of the contractual terms of the financial instrument.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset is derecognised when:\n-\nthe rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n-\nthe Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has undertaken the commitment to fully pay the cash flows received without significant delay to a third party under an arrangement and has either (a) transferred substantially all the risks and the assets of the asset or (b) has neither transferred nor held substantially all the risks and estimates of the asset but has transferred the control of the asset.\nEarnings per share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of shares for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nEquity\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.\n-\nShare capital account represents the nominal value of the shares issued.\n-\nThe share premium account represents premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.\n-\nThe share-based premium reserve arises from the requirement to value share warrants in existence at the period end at fair value.\n-\nRetained earnings comprise cumulative results as disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nTaxation\nTax currently payable is based on taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n4 New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted from 1 January 2025:\nThere are no accounting pronouncements which have become effective from 1 January 2025 that have a significant impact on the Company's interim condensed financial statements.\nThe following new amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2025:\n-\nLack of exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)\n5\nCritical accounting estimates and judgments\nIn preparing the condensed interim financial statements, the Directors have to make judgments on how to apply the Company's accounting policies and make estimates about the future.\nThe Directors do not consider there to be any critical judgments that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the condensed interim financial statements.\n6 Operating expenses by nature\nAdministrative expenses\nSix months ended 30 June 2025\u00a3\nSix months\nended 30\nJune 2024\u00a3\nLegal and professional costs\n11,233\n7,030\nRegulatory costs\n22,415\n14,043\nWebsite costs\n4,770\n4,668\nCompany secretarial\n7,955\n5,719\nBroking costs\n3,600\n10,800\nShare registrars\n4,095\n2,982\nAssessment of acquisition opportunities\n10,000\n13,867\nOther expenses\n2,611\n2,814\nTotal administrative expenses\n66,679\n61,923\n7 Directors and employees\nThere were no employees during the period.

No related deferred tax asset has been provided for in the accounts based on the uncertainty as to when profits will be generated against which to relieve such asset.\n10 Earnings per ordinary share\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of shares in issue and potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period.\nBecause the Company was in a net loss position, diluted loss per share excludes the effects of ordinary share equivalents consisting of warrants, which are anti-dilutive.\nSix\nmonths ended\n30 June 2024\n\u00a3\nSix months ended 30 June 2023\n\u00a3\nLoss for the period attributable to shareholders\n(63,685)\n(61,140)\nWeighted average number of shares in issue\n10,500,000\n10,500,000\nEarnings per share (\u00a3)\n(0.006)\n(0.006)\n11 Cash and cash equivalents\nAt 30\nJune\n2025\n\u00a3\nAt 31 December2024\u00a3\nCash at bank\n396,736\n485,642\n396,736\n485,642\n12 Share capital and warrants\nNumber ofOrdinary Shares\nNumber of Deferred Shares\nOrdinary\nShares \u00a3\nDeferred Shares\n\u00a3\nTotal\u00a3\nAt 31 December 2024 and 30 June 2025\n10,500,000\n45,000\n1,050,000\n-\n1,050,000\nWarrants\nThe Company granted a total of 12,780,000 unlisted Warrants, on Admission in April 2022, in relation to the share capital of the Company.\nOn 2 April 2025, the following amendments were passed by the warrant holders:\n(a) the rights of the Aura Freely Transferable Warrants 2022 and of the Aura Broker Warrants 2022 were amended so as to:\ni. reduce the Exercise Price of the Warrants from 15 pence (\u00a30.15) to 10 pence (\u00a30.10) per ordinary share of \u00a30.01 in the capital of the Company being subscribed for; and\nii. extend the Long Stop Date for exercising Warrants from 8 April 2025 (three years from the date of Admission) to the date which is three years from completion of the first acquisition by the Company of a target company or business as part of the Company's overall business objective and strategy; and\n(b) the rights of the Aura Directors' Warrants 2022 were amended, so as to reduce the Exercise Price of the Warrants from 15 pence (\u00a30.15) to 10 pence (\u00a30.10) per Share subscribed for; and\n(c) the rights of the Aura Founder Warrants 2022 were amended, so that the conditions to vesting will be:\ni. the initial acquisition has been completed; and\nii. the 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price of the Company's ordinary shares at any time after 8 April 2025 exceeds \u00a30.10 per share (as adjusted to take account of any sub-division, consolidation or other change to the ordinary share capital of the Company after the date on which the warrant instrument was executed),\nthe price in (ii) previously being \u00a30.15 per share.\nNo warrants were exercised in the period ended 30 June 2025 and accordingly all 12,780,000 warrants remained outstanding.\n13 Related party transactions\nDuring the six months to 30 June 2025, Harmony Global Partners Limited, a shareholder in the Company, provided services in connection with the assessment of acquisition opportunities for fees totalling \u00a310,000.\n14 Post balance sheet events\nThere were no events arising after 30 June 2025 that require to be disclosed as balance sheet events.\n15 Ultimate controlling party\nAt 30 June 2025, the Company did not have any single identifiable controlling party.\n16.

Indicate in the relevant section whether the issuer is a non UK issuer.\niii\nOther reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.\niv\nThis should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h); (c) all parties to the agreement referred to in DTR5.2.1 (a) or (d) the holder of financial instruments referred to in DTR5.3.1.\nAs the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.\nIn relation to the transactions referred to in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h), the following list is provided as indication of the persons who should be mentioned:\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (b), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring temporarily for consideration the voting rights;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (c), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (d), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural person or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (e), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification duty at an individual level under DTR 5.1, under DTR5.2.1 (a) to (d) or under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (f), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (g), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (h), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights at his discretion (e.g. management companies).\nv\nApplicable in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity referred to DTR5.2 unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with national practices (e.g. identification of funds managed by management companies).\nvi\nThe date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took effect.\nvii\nThe total number of voting rights held in the issuer shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.\nviii\nIf the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold, please note that it might not be necessary to disclose the extent of the holding, only that the new holding is below that threshold.\nix\nIn case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached \"direct holding\" and voting rights \"indirect holding\", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.\nx\nDate of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.\nxi\nIf the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months starting from [date].\nxii\nIn case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-adjusted basis (DTR 5.3.3.A).\nxiii\nIf the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then the second option applies.\nxiv\nThe full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity has to be presented also in the cases, in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification as only in this way will the markets get always the full picture of the group holdings. In case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains have to be presented chain by chain by numbering each chain accordingly. Please see the below example:\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain 1)\nName of controlled undertaking B\nName of controlled undertaking C\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain 2)\nName of controlled undertaking B\nName of controlled undertaking D\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain3)\nName of controlled undertaking E\nName of controlled undertaking F\nxv\nThe names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held have to be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.\nxvi\nExample: Correction of a previous notification.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
