This is reflected in our net loss before taxation for the six-month period of \u00a361,928 (2023: \u00a369,598 (loss)), and that at 30 June 2024, we had retained cash and bank resources of \u00a3589,531.\n\"The board continues to identify and assess acquisition and investment opportunities in the UK and overseas, which could offer the quality and scalability required to achieve significant shareholder growth. We also continue to engage with the board's extensive business network and introducer base to promote the Company expansion strategy.\n\"Economic and political uncertainty has helpfully reduced during the year to date, as has inflation, and interest rates are beginning to edge down. While capital market and new issues activity has been generally depressed since November 2021, there have been signs of more corporate activity, particularly at the smaller end of the market during 2024, and M&A is more buoyant. The now widespread acceptance and understanding of the danger of global warming on populations, habitats and landscapes continues to underpin our business strategy and economic rationale. Fortunately, there is a growing willingness by\nnational governments to focus on sustainable renewable energy.\n\"With the stated intention to make Britain a clean energy superpower, the new Labour Government in the UK has committed to work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. This commitment is made with the intention of making the UK more energy secure, protect consumers from price fluctuations in fossil fuels, and help drive investment in jobs and businesses in the renewable energy sector, while seeking to achieve medium- and longer-term carbon reduction targets.\n\"Support for renewable energy remains positive across the UK economy. Investment in the major, continued restructuring of Britain's electricity grid to facilitate the transition to renewable energy remains on track. Our conversations underline sustained support by the institutional investment community for the energy transition and this is consistent with media reporting. Installation of both solar PV and heat pumps in UK homes are at record highs. The UK remains a vibrant market for innovation in low-carbon technologies. While there is some public and media pushback on the Net Zero agenda, not least due to higher energy prices, we believe this is taking place in the normal political discourse, while the underlying drivers for change are as strong as ever.\n\"We have been cautious in our targeted and considered approach to our first acquisition, particularly during a time when the ability to raise finance on capital markets has been severely restricted by investor caution and economic uncertainty. We have sought to identify a transformational target that can create a meaningful contribution in the renewable energy space, and this remains our intention. The renewable energy sector will offer exciting opportunities for acquisitive and organic growth as capital markets recover, and we are committed to ensure that the Company and its stakeholders will share in these opportunities.\"\nEnquiries\nAura Renewable Acquisitions Plc\nJohn Croft (Non-Exec Chairman)\n07785315588\nRobin Stevens (Non-Exec Director)\n07787112059\nMedia enquiries\nAllerton Communications\nPeter Curtain\n020 3633 1730\naurarenewables@allertoncomms.co.uk\nNotes to Editors\nAura was established to acquire and then act as the holding company for targeted businesses operating in the Global Renewable Energy Sector Supply Chain, particularly participants in the wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, carbon capture, waste management, smart grids and green hydrogen supply chain, and their sub-sectors.
