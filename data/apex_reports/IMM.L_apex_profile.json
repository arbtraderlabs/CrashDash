Indicate in the relevant section whether the issuer is a non UK issuer.\niii\nOther reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.\niv\nThis should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h); (c) all parties to the agreement referred to in DTR5.2.1 (a) or (d) the holder of financial instruments referred to in DTR5.3.1.\nAs the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.\nIn relation to the transactions referred to in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h), the following list is provided as indication of the persons who should be mentioned:\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (b), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring temporarily for consideration the voting rights;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (c), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (d), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural person or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (e), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification duty at an individual level under DTR 5.1, under DTR5.2.1 (a) to (d) or under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (f), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (g), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;\n- in the circumstances foreseen in DTR5.2.1 (h), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights at his discretion (e.g. management companies).\nv\nApplicable in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity referred to DTR5.2 unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with national practices (e.g. identification of funds managed by management companies).\nvi\nThe date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took effect.\nvii\nThe total number of voting rights held in the issuer shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.\nviii\nIf the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold, please note that it might not be necessary to disclose the extent of the holding, only that the new holding is below that threshold.\nix\nIn case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached \"direct holding\" and voting rights \"indirect holding\", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.\nx\nDate of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.\nxi\nIf the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months starting from [date].\nxii\nIn case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-adjusted basis (DTR 5.3.3.A).\nxiii\nIf the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then the second option applies.\nxiv\nThe full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity has to be presented also in the cases, in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification as only in this way will the markets get always the full picture of the group holdings. In case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains have to be presented chain by chain by numbering each chain accordingly. Please see the below example:\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain 1)\nName of controlled undertaking B\nName of controlled undertaking C\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain 2)\nName of controlled undertaking B\nName of controlled undertaking D\nName of ultimate controlling person A (chain3)\nName of controlled undertaking E\nName of controlled undertaking F\nxv\nThe names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held have to be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.\nxvi\nExample: Correction of a previous notification.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

A number of parties have signed Confidential Disclosure Agreements.\nAs would be expected, discussions cover a broad spectrum of subjects including scientific, technical and commercial aspects of P140 and by their nature these are, and continue to be, detailed and time consuming.\nImmuPharma's objective is to identify \"the best fit\" partner for P140's further development and commercialisation and to secure the best possible deal for ImmuPharma's shareholders.\nTo this end, based on the engagements with potential partners to date, the Board now expects the completion of any partnership deal to extend beyond the end of 2025, with our aim being to move to completion of a deal as soon as practicable in 2026.\nFurther updates will be communicated to the market as and when further progress has been made, as appropriate.\nFinancial Update and Outlook\nImmuPharma's financial position remains strong, benefiting from recent R&D tax credits received; exercise of warrants (as per notifications made on 11 and 17 September 2025) and enhanced receipts under the now completed Lanstead Capital sharing agreement, which resulted in aggregate receipts of c\u00a32m (a 7% increase over the original subscription (as detailed in the 13 February 2025 notification) of \u00a31.875m). As a result, the current cash runway now extends well into Q4 2026. The Company reaffirms it has no intention to raise further funds and will look to further strengthen its cash position as a result of deals with potential commercial partners.\nTim McCarthy, Chief Executive Officer of ImmuPharma, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by the positive response we have received in our partnering discussions.\nAs a reminder, the advances within our P140 autoimmune platform represent a paradigm shift in how autoimmune therapies will be diagnosed and treated and underline the strong scientific foundation and commercial potential of our technology.\nThe whole team is dedicated to securing a partnership deal that does justice to the innovation and clinical potential of P140, valuing a more methodical approach over speed, so the best outcome for shareholders can be achieved. We are seeking a partner whose culture and aspirations match those of the Board, prioritising long-term synergy.\nThe Company's financial position is now secure into Q4 2026 which provides the Company with the support and time to advance partnership activities. We look forward to providing further updates in due course.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation no 596/2014 which is part of English law by virtue of the European (withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.
