          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "9 Sep 2024 07:01\nRNS Number : 3291D\nImmupharma PLC\n09 September 2024\n9 September 2024\nImmuPharma PLC\n(\"ImmuPharma\" or the \"Company\")\nExtension of Warrants in Incanthera to 31 March 2025\nImmuPharma PLC (LSE: IMM), the specialist drug discovery and development company, is pleased to announce that the Company has agreed with Incanthera plc (\"Incanthera\") that Warrants issued to the Company on 26 February 2020, in conjunction with Incanthera's IPO onto the Aquis Exchange, are extended by a further period to 31 March 2025.\nKey highlights:\n\u00b7\nThe Company entered into a Warrant Instrument (\n\"Warrant Instrument\"\n) with Incanthera on 26 February 2020, whereby Incanthera created and issued Warrants to ImmuPharma to subscribe in cash at 9.5p per share, for 7,272,740 Ordinary Shares, valid until 6 September 2023. On 18 August 2023 Incanthera agreed with the Company to extend the Warrant Instrument by 12 months to 6 September 2024.\n\u00b7\nIncanthera has now agreed with the Company to extend the Warrant Instrument to 31 March 2025.\n\u00b7\nA cash consideration of \u00a375,000 (\"Consideration\") has been paid by ImmuPharma to obtain the extension.\n\u00b7\nOther than the change in the expiry period, all other provisions in the Warrant Instrument remain the same.\nImmuPharma currently owns no shares in Incanthera, having sold its previous holding of c9.9 million shares, as notified on 3 June 2024, at a price of 15p, realising proceeds of c.\u00a31.5 million for the Company.\nTim McCarthy, ImmuPharma's Chairman & CEO, is also the Chairman of Incanthera and has a holding of 3,931,646 shares in Incanthera (3.36% of Incanthera's issued share capital).\nWarrant Extension Rationale\nImmuPharma's rationale for agreeing to pay the Consideration to secure the extension of the Warrant Instrument is based on the following fundamental criteria:\n\u00b7\nAs at close of business on 6 September 2024, Incanthera's mid-market share price was 28.5p, which demonstrates a current nominal \"in the money\" value of the warrants of 19p per share, equivalent to \u00a31.38 million.\n\u00b7\nImmuPharma's Board believes that the Incanthera investment case is robust and that there is potential for a further accretive share price, based on key milestones being met over the next period to 31 March 2025.\n\u00b7\nAs reported in ImmuPharma's Interim results (which were also announced today), the Company has continued to manage its operations in a cost efficient manner and with a cash balance of \u00a31.1m of cash as at 30 June 2024, the Company has a robust cash runway moving forward. However, the Board did not feel it would be prudent to have deployed c\u00a3691k of the Company's funds in exercising the Warrant in the period ended 6 September 2024 (the end of the previous expiry period). This prudent control of cash reserves needs to continue over the next period.\n\u00b7\nAs also reported in the Interims, ImmuPharma continues to concentrate on securing further commercial and partnering deals over the next period, that could potentially provide a significant cash injection into the Company, to allow the Warrants to be exercised in full, and allow the Company to restore a c. 6% shareholding in Incanthera.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe extension of the Warrants has been treated as a related party transaction under the AIM Rules for Companies. Mr. McCarthy has not been involved in the Board decision in respect to agreeing to the terms of the extension.\nThe Directors (excluding Mr. McCarthy), having consulted with SPARK, the Company's nominated adviser, consider that the terms of the Warrant extension are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned\n.\nCommenting on this announcement, Tim Franklin, COO of ImmuPharma said:\n\"After careful consideration, we believe an investment of \u00a375k, to secure extended optionality associated with the warrant extension, not only retains the nominal \"in the money\" value in the Warrants, but also allows us to benefit potentially from any further accretion in Incanthera's share price as they meet key milestones over the next period.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation no 596/2014 which is part of English law by virtue of the European (withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.

But in summary, this is\nreflected in the operating loss for the period reducing to \u00a30.4m down from \u00a30.8m for the previous period.\nP140 / SLE & CIDP\nPreparation for a new international, dose-range, Phase 3 study in systemic lupus erythematosus (\"SLE\") is underway with Simbec-Orion, our appointed Contract Research Organisation (\"CRO\").\nThere are a number of significant improvements in the new Phase 3 study design compared to the one completed by ImmuPharma in 2018. Of particular note are dose levels of P140, administered through subcutaneous injection, which will be significantly higher.\nOur second major clinical study addresses chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (\"CIDP\"), a high medical need autoimmune disease. The Company received positive feedback from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a Pre-Investigational New Drug Application (pre-IND) meeting for a late-stage Phase 2/3 adaptive clinical program. CIDP is a rare disease and qualifies as an orphan indication.\nAn IND application is now being prepared for submission to the FDA, incorporating all guidance points and Simbec-Orion has been appointed as the CRO for this program.\nNew insights into P140's mechanism of action (\"MOA\") explain why it is the only non-immunosuppressing therapy in clinical development in the industry for autoimmune diseases. P140's MOA supports its potential as a therapy for patients suffering from a multitude of autoimmune diseases that are caused by the same underlying malfunction. This agrees with preclinical animal models where P140 has demonstrated efficacy in several autoimmune diseases, for example, asthma (acute and chronic), gout, periodontitis, IBD and Sjogren's disease.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)\nImmuPharma continues to have important collaboration arrangements with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (\"CNRS\"), the French National Council for Scientific Research and the largest basic research organisation in Europe.\nAnti-Infection\nAnti-infection (antifungal and antibacterial) was chosen as a core therapy focus because of the continual emergence and threat of new and drug-resistant fungi and bacteria.\nThe innovative peptide technology at ImmuPharma Biotech has been a huge success and very recently has given rise to two novel development programs, out of which we have identified two core programs, in pre-clinical development: BioAMB and BioCin, which we believe have the best commercial opportunity and speed to market. The new entities include BioAMB (a new antifungal based on amphotericin-B) and BioCIN (a new antibacterial based on vancomycin) and will be fully patent protected.\nInterest in Incanthera Plc\nOn 3rd June 2024 the Company sold its investment in shares in Incanthera plc. All of the 9,904,319 shares held at the year end were sold at 15p per share realising gross proceeds of \u00a31.5 million. ImmuPharma continues to hold 7,272,740 warrants in Incanthera plc. As of 6 September 2024, the warrants have been extended to 31 March 2025. See announcement issued on 9 September 2024 for further information.\nCurrent Activities and Outlook\nWe remain committed as a Board, on the development of P140 in SLE and CIDP, our two key late-stage clinical assets, together with securing additional partnering for P140. We have made significant scientific progress over the last period, including refinement of the protocols for the SLE and CIDP studies and new insights into the MOA of P140, and as a result, we have a high level of confidence of the success of these new studies.\nWe will also continue to concentrate on securing further commercial and partnering deals, on which we have made significant progress over the last 6 months\n.\nOn an operational level, we have continued our focus on tight cost controls and maximising the use of outsourcing to keep our committed overhead costs to the minimum.

We have also strengthened the balance sheet and extended our cash runway by successfully selling our shareholding in Incanthera, whilst still retaining a further 7.3 million warrants.\nWe look forward to providing further updates on the progress of our pipeline and commercial deals throughout the remaining period of 2024 and moving into 2025.\nIn closing, we would like to thank our shareholders for their support as well as our staff, corporate and scientific advisers and our partners including CNRS and Avion.\nTim McCarthy\nChairman & CEO\n6th September 2024\nImmuPharma plc\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2024\nNote\nUnaudited\n6 months ended\n30 June 2024\nAudited Year ended 31 December 2023\nUnaudited 6 months ended\n30 June 2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nContinuing operations\nRevenue\n-\n-\n69,959\nResearch and development expenses\n(473,521)\n(\n2,022,305\n)\n(828,767)\nAdministrative expenses\n(258,023)\n(\n1,020,345\n)\n(412,277)\nShare based expense\n(32,683)\n(\n140,238\n)\n(127,327)\nOther operating income\n-\n119,881\n-\nOperating loss\n(764,227)\n(3,063,007\n)\n(1,298,412)\nFinance costs\n6\n(3,150)\n(358,915)\n(931)\nFinance income\n172,610\n3,025\n162,286\nLoss before taxation\n(594,767)\n(3,418,897)\n(1,137,057)\nTax\n206,915\n497,102\n289,691\nLoss for the period\n(387,852)\n(2,921,795)\n(847,366)\nAttributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent company\n(387,852)\n(2,921,795)\n(847,366)\nLoss per ordinary share\nBasic and diluted\n2\n(0.09)p\n(0.81)p\n(0.25)p\nImmuPharma plc\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2024\nUnaudited\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\nAudited Year\nended 31 December 2023\nUnaudited 6 months ended\n30 June\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the financial period\n(387,852)\n(2,921,795)\n(847,366)\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss:\nFair value gain/(loss) on investment\n730,266\n(44,569)\n(54,474)\nFair value gain/(loss) on warrants\n1,240,831\n(1,228)\n7,421\nTotal items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss\n1,971,097\n(45,797)\n(47,053)\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss:\nExchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n19,008\n857\n(18,897)\nTotal items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss\n19,008\n857\n(18,897)\nOther comprehensive gain/(loss) for the period\n1,990,105\n(44,940)\n(65,950)\nTotal comprehensive gain/(loss) for the period\n1,602,253\n(2,966,735)\n(913,316)\nImmuPharma plc\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 30 JUNE 2024\nNote\nUnaudited\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\nAudited Year\nended 31 December 2023\nUnaudited 6 months ended\n30 June\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n460,182\n447,571\n463,207\nProperty, plant and equipment\nFinancial asset\n87,580\n1,240,826\n102,075\n643,782\n332,992\n642,526\nDerivative financial asset\n4\n83,561\n184,784\n36,466\nTotal non-current assets\n1,872,149\n1,378,212\n1,475,191\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n348,718\n476,780\n705,867\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,084,440\n432,797\n210,584\nCurrent tax asset\n345,942\n208,481\n624,429\nDerivative financial asset\n4\n411,414\n234,141\n272,388\nTotal current assets\n2,190,514\n1,343,199\n1,813,268\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n(1,371,438)\n(1,665,122)\n(1,551,071)\nTotal current liabilities\n(1,371,438)\n(1,665,122)\n(1,551,071)\nNet current assets\n819,076\n(321,923)\n262,197\nNet assets\n2,691,225\n1,056,289\n1,737,388\nEQUITY\nOrdinary shares\n5\n29,813,018\n29,813,018\n28,982,676\nShare premium\n29,317,444\n29,317,444\n28,788,377\nMerger reserve\n106,148\n106,148\n106,148\nOther reserves\n5,954,282\n5,902,591\n5,869,926\nRetained earnings\n(62,499,667)\n(64,082,912)\n(62,009,739)\nTotal equity\n2,691,225\n1,056,289\n1,737,388\nImmuPharma plc\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2023\nOrdinary shares\n\u00a3\nShare premium\n\u00a3\nMerger\nReserve\n\u00a3\nOther\nreserves -\nAcquisition\nReserve\n\u00a3\nOther\nreserves -\nTranslation\nReserve\n\u00a3\nOther reserves -Share based payment reserve\n\u00a3\nOther reserves -

The Company's portfolio includes novel peptide therapeutics for autoimmune diseases and anti-infectives. The lead program, P140, is a unique non-immunosuppressive peptide for the treatment of SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) and CIDP (Chronic Idiopathic Demyelinating Polyneuropathy) and preclinical models suggest therapeutic activity for many other autoimmune diseases.\nAbout Lupus\u00a0(Systemic Lupus Erythematosus / SLE)\nLupus is a chronic inflammatory disease which is thought to affect some 16 million individuals worldwide. The current standard of care still consists of steroid and anti-malarial therapies which have side-effects and poor response in many patients. Recently more targeted monoclonal therapies are GlaxoSmithKline's Benlysta and more recently, AstraZeneca's Saphnelo. There still exists a high unmet medical need for a drug that has a strong efficacy and safety profile.\nFor additional information about ImmuPharma please visit\nwww.immupharma\n.co.uk\nImmuPharma's LEI (Legal Entity Identifier) code\u00a0: 213800VZKGHXC7VUS895.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.\n7 September 2023\nImmuPharma Plc\n(\"\nImmuPharma\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nResult of Retail Offer and Director Shareholding\nImmuPharma Plc is pleased to announce\u00a0that further to the Company's announcement\u00a0at 7:02 a.m.\u00a0on 31 August 2023, the Company has conditionally raised gross proceeds of \u00a3130,683 through the issue of 6,534,150 New Ordinary Shares at a price of 2 pence to existing retail investors of the Company, via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (\"WRAP\"), in addition to the \u00a31.35 million raised in the Subscription and Direct Subscription.\nAn application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 6,534,150 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM. Admission is expected to take place, and dealings on AIM in the Retail Offer Shares are expected to commence, at 8.00 a.m. on or around 12 September 2023.\nDirector Dealing\nLisa Baderoon, Director, subscribed for 1,000,000 Retail Offer Shares in the Retail Offer. Following Admission, Lisa Baderoon's shareholding will be 1,583,963 Ordinary Shares comprising 0.38% of the issued share capital.]\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company will have 416,437,265 Ordinary Shares in issue. Since the Company currently holds no shares in treasury, the total number of voting rights in the Company will therefore be 416,437,265. These figures may therefore be used by Shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCapitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement have the same meanings as set out in the announcement of the Company at 7:02 a.m. on 31 August 2023.\nFor Further Information\nImmuPharma plc\nTim McCarthy, Chief Executive Officer\nLisa Baderoon, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0) 207 206 2650\n+ 44 (0) 7721 413496\nStanford Capital Partners\nPatrick Claridge\nBob Pountney\n+44 (0) 203 650 3650\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 203 368 3554\nNeil Baldwin\n+44 (0) 113 370 8974\nWinterflood Retail Access Platform\nWRAP@winterflood.com\nAlex Skrine, Head of Electronic Trading\n+44 (0) 20 3100 0000\nPhoebe Pankhurst, Corporate Finance\nHaris Khawaja, Corporate Finance\nFurther information on the Company can be found on its website at https://www.immupharma.co.uk/\nThe Company's LEI is 213800VZKGHXC7VUS895\n1\nD\net\nails\nof\nt\nh\ne\np\ner\nson\nd\nis\nc\nh\na\nr\ngi\nn\ng\nm\na\nn\nag\ner\nial\nre\ns\np\no\nn\nsi\nb\ni\nli\nt\ni\ne\ns\n/\np\ner\nson\nc\nlos\ne\nly asso\nc\nia\nte\nd\na)\nName\nLisa Baderoon\n2\nReason for notification\na)\nPosition / status\nDirector\nb)\nI\nniti\na\nl noti\nf\ni\nca\nt\ni\non\n/Am\ne\nndm\ne\nnt\nInitial\n3\nD\net\nails\nof\nt\nh\ne\niss\nu\ner\n,\ne\nm\nission\nallo\nw\na\nn\nc\ne\nm\na\nr\nk\ne\nt\np\na\nrt\ni\nc\ni\np\na\nn\nt\n,\na\nu\nct\ni\non\np\nla\nt\nf\no\nr\nm\n, a\nu\nct\nio\nn\nee\nr\nor\na\nuc\nt\nion\nm\no\nn\ni\nt\nor\na)\nName\nImmuPharma Plc\nb)\nLEI\n213800VZKGHXC7VUS895\n4\nD\net\nails\nof\nt\nh\ne\nt\nr\na\nn\nsa\nct\ni\no\nn\n(\ns\n)\n: s\nect\nion\nt\no\nb\ne\nre\np\ne\na\nte\nd\nf\nor\n(\ni\n)\ne\na\nc\nh\nt\ny\np\ne\nof\ni\nn\ns\ntr\nu\nm\ne\nn\nt\n;\n(\nii)\ne\na\nc\nh\nt\ny\np\ne\nof\ntr\na\nn\nsa\nc\nt\nio\nn\n;\n(\niii)\ne\na\nc\nh\nd\na\nte\n;\na\nn\nd\n(\ni\nv)\ne\na\nc\nh\np\nla\nc\ne\nw\nh\ner\ne\ntr\na\nn\nsa\nct\nio\nn\ns\nh\nave\nb\nee\nn\nc\no\nndu\ncted\na)\nD\ne\ns\ncr\niption\nof\nthe\nf\nin\na\nn\nc\ni\na\nl inst\nr\num\ne\nnt,\nt\ny\npe of\ninst\nr\num\ne\nnt\nI\nd\ne\nnti\nf\ni\nca\ntion\nc\no\nd\ne\nOrdinary shares of 1p (\u00a30.01) each in the capital of ImmuPharma plc\nISIN\nGB0033711010\nNature of the transaction\nSubscription in retail offer\nPrice(s) and volumes(s)\nPrice(s)\nVolume(s)\n\u00a30.02\n1,000,000\nd)\nAggregated information\n-\nAggregated volume\n- Aggregated price\n1,000,000\n\u00a30.02\ne)\nDate of the transaction\n7 September 2023\nf)\nPlace of the transaction\nOutside a trading venue\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
