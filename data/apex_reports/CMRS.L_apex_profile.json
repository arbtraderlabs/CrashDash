Prospecting by CMR's geological team demonstrates copper and silver in multiple quartz vein and shear zone structures with some zones assaying for gold.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is also in discussions with a leading global commodity trading group that would like CMR to act as its Moroccan partner to source and supply certain minerals for its global supply chain. Trading in metals and potentially industrial minerals, either in a partnership or individually, provides the Company with an opportunity for near-term cash flows.\n\u00b7\nIfri Project located in an alteration hotspot and initial channel sampling included an assay of 3.1% copper and 17 g/t silver.\n\u00b7\nThe Ifri Project is in an active mining belt which hosts four active and seven previously operating mines of copper, silver and gold.\nBackground to the Placing and use of proceeds\nOn 16 January 2024, the Company announced it had acquired 26 exploration permits\nin central Morocco\nprospective for copper, antimony, tungsten, lead-zinc and gold via the acquisition of\nHesperis Resources SARL, a Moroccan company. The acquisition transforms the Morrocan footprint of CMR's incubator portfolio and its exposure to a wider range of critical metals and minerals. It also cements CMR's position as one of the region's leading developers of critical minerals.\nIfri Project mineralisation\nCMR remains focused on developing Morrocan clean energy and critical minerals projects that offer significant scale potential. Accordingly, and following in-depth analysis, the Company has concluded the Ifri Project meets these criteria. Initial prospecting at the Ifri site located multiple large copper mineralised shear structures with copper oxide, copper sulphide, silver and gold mineralisation.\nNet proceeds from the Placing will enable a complete mapping and geochemical survey of the project area. Ifri benefits from established local road and power infrastructure.\nMorocco operations\nIn the last 9 months, the Company has gained significant momentum in Morroco. It now has a considerable geological understanding of the region's potential as a global commodities hub. Furthermore, it has extensive relationships within the mining sector at a domestic level. This regional Intellectual Property and know-how has led to the Company receiving interest from a leading global commodity trading group to become its Morrocan partner and supply it with commodities from the region\n. CMR is now in discussions to formalise the partnership.\nPDMR Dealing & KM Securities Pty Ltd\nKM Securities Pty Ltd\u00a0('KM Securities'), in which\u00a0Russell Thomson, a Non-Executive Director of the Company is a 50% shareholder, acquired 2,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company as part of this Placing.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"I would like to thank our existing shareholders for their support and welcome new shareholders to the register. The net proceeds from the Fundraising will accelerate the significant Morrocan opportunities CMR has successfully created and advanced in recent months. As a specialist Morrocan exploration and development company, we remain focused on developing projects and opportunities that offer the prospect for meaningful production of critical commodities and near-term cash generation. We are delighted with our recent progress and are confident the fundraise will further enhance our Morrocan momentum.\"\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) plc is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities essential for renewable energy, battery storage and electrification to support the clean energy revolution.

These commodities are widely recognised as being at the start of a supply and demand supercycle.\nCMR is building a diversified portfolio of high-quality metals exploration and development projects in Morocco, focusing on copper, nickel, manganese, cobalt, and potentially rare earths. CMR identified Morocco as an ideal mining-friendly jurisdiction that meets its acquisition and operational criteria. The country is perfectly located to supply raw materials to Europe and possesses excellent prospective geology, infrastructure and attractive permitting, tax and royalty conditions. In 2023, the Company acquired an 80% stake in leading Moroccan exploration and geological services company Atlantic Research Minerals SARL.\nSince taking over the CMR in 2022, the current management has completed a comprehensive strategic review and restructuring of the business and implemented its clear strategy to maximise exploration and resource development opportunities for the benefit of all stakeholders.

Prospecting by CMR's geological team has demonstrated copper and silver in multiple shear zone and quartz vein structures with some structures containing gold mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nChannel samples include assay results of (1) 3.1% copper and 17 g/t silver (2) 1.95% copper and 15 g/t silver, and (3) 0.86 g/t gold and 21 g/t silver. These initial samples are demonstrative of Ifri's potential.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is pleased to see copper and silver grades returned at Ifri given the incidence of visible copper sulphide and copper oxide mineralisation on the property and Ifri's proximity to the Tagmout copper-silver mine.\n\u00b7\nThe presence of gold in the system is also extremely encouraging given nearby industrial scale and artisanal underground gold mining. Existing mines are targeting the quartz structures with gold grades in the region known to improve at depth.\n\u00b7\nThe Ifri Project is located in a well-known mining belt which hosts active and previously operating mines. These include the Imiter silver mine, the Tiouit gold mine, the Bou Skour copper project and the Tagmout silver-copper project less than 5.0km away from Ifri.\nIfri Project summary\nInitial prospecting at the Ifri site has identified multiple large mineralised shear structures with copper oxide, copper sulphide, silver and gold mineralisation. Historical small scale mining for copper and gold is also evident at numerous locations across the property and, significantly, there is a significant scale drilling programme 2.5km west of the permit and an underground gold mine being developed less than 10km north of the permit. We have located these operations but the project names are unknown and it is unclear who the operators are.\nFig 1 Ifri Project mineralisation\nSource: Critical Mineral Resources PLC\nSaghro Massif Potential\nIfri is located within the Saghro Massif, an area of old (Precambrian) igneous rocks in the Anti-Atlas. In a relatively small area, this series of inliers hosts multiple past producing mines, operational mines and development projects. Probably the most well-know mines are the Imiter silver mine and the Tiouit gold mine. The Bou Skour copper project and Tagmout copper-silver project are also significant deposits and located very close to Ifri. Figure 3 illustrates Ifri's location within an alteration hot spot, where NE-SW faults are thought to represent paths for hydrothermal fluids and mineralisation.\nFig 2 Saghro Massif mining belt\nSource: Critical Mineral Resources PLC\nFig 3 Ifri's location and mineral prospectivity map\nSource: Mamouch, Y.; Attou, A.; Miftah, A.; Ouchchen, M.; Dadi, B.; Achkouch, L.; Et-tayea, Y.; Allaoui, A.; Boualoul, M.; Randazzo, G.; et al.

Sci. 2022, 12, 957.\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/app12030957\n?\nIfri Outlook\nThe next stage at Ifri is a\nsystematic exploration programme including detailed mapping, geochemical surveying, followed by geophysics and drill-target generation.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"We are very excited about the Ifri Project and its potential to host both copper-silver and gold deposits. Ifri is located in a mineralised system and we will now focus on systematic exploration and drill target generation. We are encouraged by the numerous mines in this belt, several of which are intrusion-related deposits, and therefore the region's strong potential for large scale discoveries. At Ifri, we will be targeting both mineralised structures near the surface and richer sources of copper, silver and gold at depth\".\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities essential for renewable energy, battery storage and electrification to support the clean energy revolution.
