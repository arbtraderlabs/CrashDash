Drilling during H1 is designed to produce Agadir Melloul\u2019s maiden resource estimate, targeted for publication in early Q3 2026.\nKey Highlights\nAccelerated drill programme at Agadir-Melloul\nTwo diamond rigs ramping-up to two shifts per day each\n20 holes planned per month from mid-February\nAgadir Melloul\u2019s maiden resource estimate targeted for Q3 2026\nFig.1 Company\u2019s diamond rig at Agadir Melloul\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cWith two rigs now turning, we anticipate an extremely productive drill programme and for an internal maiden resource to be modelled by late Q2 and for the JORC compliant resource estimate to be published in early Q3.\nDrilling has been intermittent in recent weeks due to inclement weather. This week both rigs are operating on day shifts, and once the weather improves night shifts will be introduced. From then on we should be drilling 20 holes per month equating to approximately 1,000m.\nFor a near-surface project like this, metres drilled is less important than the number of holes drilled. Each hole will range from 20m to 50m depth, with the occasional deeper hole to drill-test the basement as we continue the hunt for mineralised rhyolite.\nIt\u2019s worth reiterating that near-surface mineralisation is quite unusual and a huge economic advantage in terms of opex, upfront capex, reserve development capex and ongoing sustaining capex\u201d.\nENDS\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\nChief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nShard Capital LLP\nErik Woolgar\nDamon Heath\nAlbR Capital\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 207 186 9952\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce critical minerals for the global economy, including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution. Many of these commodities are widely recognised as being at the start of a supply and demand super cycle.\nCMR is building a diversified portfolio of high-quality metals exploration and development projects in Morocco, focusing on copper, silver and potentially other critical minerals and metals. CMR identified Morocco as an ideal mining-friendly jurisdiction that meets its acquisition and operational criteria.

Prospecting by CMR's geological team demonstrates copper and silver in multiple quartz vein and shear zone structures with some zones assaying for gold.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is also in discussions with a leading global commodity trading group that would like CMR to act as its Moroccan partner to source and supply certain minerals for its global supply chain. Trading in metals and potentially industrial minerals, either in a partnership or individually, provides the Company with an opportunity for near-term cash flows.\n\u00b7\nIfri Project located in an alteration hotspot and initial channel sampling included an assay of 3.1% copper and 17 g/t silver.\n\u00b7\nThe Ifri Project is in an active mining belt which hosts four active and seven previously operating mines of copper, silver and gold.\nBackground to the Placing and use of proceeds\nOn 16 January 2024, the Company announced it had acquired 26 exploration permits\nin central Morocco\nprospective for copper, antimony, tungsten, lead-zinc and gold via the acquisition of\nHesperis Resources SARL, a Moroccan company. The acquisition transforms the Morrocan footprint of CMR's incubator portfolio and its exposure to a wider range of critical metals and minerals. It also cements CMR's position as one of the region's leading developers of critical minerals.\nIfri Project mineralisation\nCMR remains focused on developing Morrocan clean energy and critical minerals projects that offer significant scale potential. Accordingly, and following in-depth analysis, the Company has concluded the Ifri Project meets these criteria. Initial prospecting at the Ifri site located multiple large copper mineralised shear structures with copper oxide, copper sulphide, silver and gold mineralisation.\nNet proceeds from the Placing will enable a complete mapping and geochemical survey of the project area. Ifri benefits from established local road and power infrastructure.\nMorocco operations\nIn the last 9 months, the Company has gained significant momentum in Morroco. It now has a considerable geological understanding of the region's potential as a global commodities hub. Furthermore, it has extensive relationships within the mining sector at a domestic level. This regional Intellectual Property and know-how has led to the Company receiving interest from a leading global commodity trading group to become its Morrocan partner and supply it with commodities from the region\n. CMR is now in discussions to formalise the partnership.\nPDMR Dealing & KM Securities Pty Ltd\nKM Securities Pty Ltd\u00a0('KM Securities'), in which\u00a0Russell Thomson, a Non-Executive Director of the Company is a 50% shareholder, acquired 2,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company as part of this Placing.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"I would like to thank our existing shareholders for their support and welcome new shareholders to the register. The net proceeds from the Fundraising will accelerate the significant Morrocan opportunities CMR has successfully created and advanced in recent months. As a specialist Morrocan exploration and development company, we remain focused on developing projects and opportunities that offer the prospect for meaningful production of critical commodities and near-term cash generation. We are delighted with our recent progress and are confident the fundraise will further enhance our Morrocan momentum.\"\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) plc is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities essential for renewable energy, battery storage and electrification to support the clean energy revolution.

Our drilling continues to define shallow copper mineralisation, and we now have the extremely exciting addition of a gold discovery, also in a shallow setting.\nIn the latest results, we intercepted another 10m of nicely mineralised rhyolite, adding further support for more than one mineralised system and expanding the opportunity beyond the initial model.\nThere are also two copper-silver mineralised quartz veins within the project which will be mapped and drilled in due course. These are expected to add higher grade tonnage to the resource for blending with lower grade material.\nSo our targets now include sedimentary copper in carbonates, copper mineralised rhyolite, a gold system, and the copper vein structures we have not yet drilled.\nOur strong belief is that, over time, drilling will delineate multiple zones of potentially economic shallow copper mineralisation, within broader envelopes of lower grade material. In our view, it is only a matter of time and drill metres before we define sufficient resources to push the button on construction of a starter operation, what we\u2019ve named the Initial Mine. We expect that decision to be made in early 2027\u201d\nOutlook\nCMR remains firmly on track to deliver a shallow, open pittable, maiden resource by late Q2 to early Q3 2026, sufficient in scale to underpin the Initial Mine development. CMR\u2019s longer term Initial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper is based on a shallow, semi-continuous tabular resource with a 2.0m average thickness and an average grade of 1.2% copper equivalent.\nFollowing publication of the resource estimate in H1 2026, CMR will immediately commence the Agadir-Melloul feasibility study and Environmental Impact Assessment for the processing plant, targeting construction of the Initial Mine during 2027. With the Company\u2019s own, new rig now operational, we expect drilling to be maintained at a steady rate with fewer breakdowns.\nThe project is emerging as one of the most compelling new copper discoveries, combining shallow geometry, good grades, attractive scale potential, and multi system upside, a combination rarely seen at this early stage of exploration.\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman. Mr. Chapman has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity to which he is undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2004 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves and as a qualified person under the AIM Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies.

The team is now focused on commissioning the rig as quickly as possible, with the first bore hole expected to be drilled during the first half of December.\nHighlights\nThe Company\u2019s fully refurbished Discovery HD track-mounted diamond core drill has arrived at Agadir Melloul.\nSome important features:\nFitted with brand new Caterpillar\n308E steel tracks for rapid moves between drill pads\nCompact, robust design with a heavy-duty telescopic mast and powerful hoisting winch capable of pulling the complete drill string from the ground and pulling in 20 ft sections\nDrilling depth capacity of 1400m NQ (47.6mm core), 876m HQ (63.5mm core)\nDelivered with new consumable parts such as jaws, bushings and comprehensive remote site spares kit to minimise risk of downtime\nThe rig is expected to be operational during the first half of December, almost immediately doubling our drilling capacity.\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cIt has been quite a journey for our Discovery HD rig and its arrival represents an important milestone for the project. The rig has undergone a comprehensive refurbishment and is effectively as good as new.\nWith proper care, we expect it to deliver consistent performance for the next decade and provide significant per metre cost savings.\nMulti Power, the manufacturer, was extremely supportive, generously installing a brand new feed cylinder, instead of resealing the original, replacing key components including foot clamp, and completely stripping and professionally repainting the mast. New Cat 308E tracks were also sourced and installed to ensure maximum efficiency.\nThe additional refurbishment and some shipping complications meant the rig arrived later than originally planned. It is a testament to our team on the ground, and the advantages of operating in Morocco, that once we knew of the delay, we were quickly able to secure the services of a trusted drilling contractor who began work immediately, ensuring that progress continued uninterrupted.\nWe are now carefully unpacking and inspecting all components, and with our newly appointed drill operator already in place, the team is ready to commission and bring the rig into operation without delay. The arrival of our rig puts us in an excellent position to significantly accelerate drilling and to advance on all fronts, simultaneously drilling both the sedimentary copper deposit and the exciting new Rhyolite discovery.\nWe look forward to seeing the Discovery HD drill its first holes in the first half of December\u201d.\nFig.1\nDiscovery HD track-mounted diamond drill at Agadir Melloul\nSource: Company\nENDS\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\nChief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nAlbR Capital\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce critical minerals for the global economy, including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

Ongoing mapping confirms a district wide mineralised envelope, consistent with our 25 million tonne Initial Exploration Target.\nShallow, near surface tabular copper deposit supports low capex and rapid development pathway, with a geometry amenable to open-pit operations.\nThe new Rhyolite Target copper-silver discovery adds a second, potentially large scale, mineral system, materially expanding the projects already significant upside potential.\nOn track to break ground on the Initial Mine Development in 2027, with a maiden resource expected as early as H1 2026.\nDrill results\nSediment hosted mineralisation:\nBH01 - 5.8m at 1.12% copper and 19g/t silver from 2.2m\nBH04 - 2.5m at 0.85% copper and 4g/t silver from 1.5m\nBH06 - 2.0m at 1.3% copper from 16m\nBH07 - 1.3m at 0.98% copper from 16.7m\nBH09 - 3.0m at 0.75% copper from 10m\nBH12 - 4.0m at 1.04% copper from 2.0m\nBH 35 - 7.5m at 0.97% copper inc. 6.5m at 1.03% copper\nBH 36 - 4.7m at 1.48% copper from 17m\nBH 38 - 4.7m at 1.03% copper from 27m\nBH 43 - 3.0m at 1.1% copper from 6.0m\nBH 45 - 1.60m at 1.1% copper from 6.0m, 4.0m at 0.77% copper and 2.0m at 1.05% copper from 16.4m\nAlso, the new Rhyolite Target copper-silver discovery confirmed in late October, with the first drill hole returning very encouraging results:\nBHR01 - 6.0m at 1.4% copper and 31g/t silver from surface\nFig.1 Zone 1 North, long section showing shallow undulating mineralisation\nSource: Company\nFig.2\nZone 1 North cross section\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cThese excellent results have surpassed our expectations. We are seeing broad zones of consistent, high quality copper mineralisation in a very shallow setting, with multiple intercepts over 4m. This is a brilliant outcome, and the Initial Mine and Strategic Resource strategies are both on track.\nIt is particularly exciting that we have drilled less than 1% of our 50km\n2\nsedimentary target, and geological evidence points to a large, mineralised copper system that extends across the project area. This positions the project as a scalable, district level opportunity, and we expect continued drilling to deliver a steady flow of excellent assay results as we build towards an extensive resource.\nAgadir Melloul is different from most copper development stories in the market.\nIt combines true scale potential, shallow geometry with near surface setting, creating economically and operationally favourable mining conditions in an excellent jurisdiction. This gives us a pathway to delivering a fast tracked, near surface operation.\nAnd now we also have the unexpected bonus of a rhyolite hosted mineralisation target. This is an exciting discovery, which our team believes represents a second standalone mineral system with strong copper and silver grades. If our working model holds, this could transform Agadir Melloul into a multi-deposit copper district, dramatically enhancing its long-term strategic value.\nOur shareholders have been patient, and we are now entering a period where we believe that patience will be rewarded. We are planning to accelerate our drilling program with an additional rig, to drill multiple targets, and ultimately add equity value from different parts of the project. The momentum is gathering, and we can look forward to much more good news in the future.\u201d\nSedimentary copper - depth, grade and thickness\nCMR\u2019s Initial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper is based on a shallow, semi-continuous tabular resource with a 2.0m average thickness and an average grade of 1.2% copper equivalent. While we are retaining the 2.0m target for now, today\u2019s assay results indicate clear potential for the average thickness to exceed our current assumptions, proving tangible resource growth potential as drilling progresses.\nThe\ngeometry\nof our exploration target is comparable to several well-known sediment hosted copper orebodies in the Zechstein Basin, such as KGHM\u2019s Lubin Mine in Poland, which has an average thickness of 2.8m (ranging from 1.5m to 5.0m) and an average reser",

Samples are currently being assayed at Afrilab in Marrakech, and we expect to receive results over the next two weeks. First assays will be published by mid-November.\nEncouragingly, more than 60% of holes drilled have observable copper mineralisation, supporting the Company\u2019s expectation of a near surface resource (in some areas at surface), averaging 2.0m to 2.5m in thickness and grading 1.0% to 1.2% copper equivalent.\nFig.1 Mineralised core\nFrom the northernmost section of Zone 1 North, mineralisation is continuous southwards for approximately 750m followed by a short approximately 300m interval of lower grade material, before returning to stronger mineralisation that remains open along strike to the south.\nFigure 3 shows the area drilled thus far, shaded in dark grey. The drilled area represents less than 1% of the project\u2019s 50km\n2\ntarget limestone, highlighting the considerable exploration upside still to be realised.\nFig.2 Existing portfolio and current area of drilling\nFig.3 Drilled area in dark grey represents <1% of project\u2019s 50km\n2\ntarget limestone\nInitial Mine\nCMR is on track to delineate sufficient resources to underpin the Initial Mine development by the end of Q1 2026 or early Q2 2026.\nDrilling across Zone 1 North and Zone 2 South will support a planned 650 to 1,000tpd operation, targeting a 2.5 to 3.0 million tonne reserve and an estimated 10 year initial mine life. Management expects to have delineated 3.0 million tonnes in resources by early 2026, enabling the commencement of the Initial Mine feasibility study in mid 2026. Construction is anticipated being in 2027.\nNote: The Company\u2019s earn-in agreement requires a minimum 650tpd operation; management is targeting 1,000 tpd.\nStrategic Discovery\nAlongside the Initial Mine, the company continues to pursue its broader exploration programme across the 80km\n2\nproject area, including 50km\n2\nof target limestone. An Initial Exploration Target has been defined of 20 to 25 million tonnes at 1.2% CuEq, based on 5km\n2\nof mineralisation at an average 2m thickness.\nTo accelerate this programme, CMR expects to be operating two diamond drill rigs before the end of 2025, with a third rig to be added as results dictate. The Company\u2019s own drill rig, due to arrive during December 2025, will increase drilling productivity and reduce exploration costs. Once landed and cleared customs a separate announcement will be released with more details.\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cWe are making fantastic progress in Morocco. Commencing drilling in early September to announcing first assays in mid-November represents excellent momentum on the ground. We remain firmly on track to initiate the Initial Mine feasibility study next year, while continuing to explore for a large-scale, strategic discovery.\nOur understanding of the system at Agadir-Melloul continues to evolve.\nOnly this week, we were excited by the discovery of a significant copper-silver vein, extending from a high-grade historical mining operation. While not our main target, this discovery adds further upside value, and could be a welcome source of blending ore in future.\nAgadir Melloul is a large scale and highly prospective project, and we expect it to continue to deliver discoveries and positive results for the benefit of our shareholders, our joint venture partner and all stakeholders\u201d\nFor further information, please contact:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nAlbR Capital\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20",

We signed the formal joint venture agreement for Agadir Melloul and secured cornerstone finance. This finance, provided by our largest shareholder, followed nearly 3 months of technical and corporate due diligence, including a site visit by an independent mining consultant whose very positive technical report formed the basis of the investment decision. I think it is fair to say that these achievements, for a small company in a challenging market, are worth celebrating, and will come to define CMR\u2019s future. We are now drilling and first assay results will be published soon, most likely during\nOctober 2025\n. On this front, we have to balance strong demand for newsflow from the market, with what is best for our longer term strategy and shareholders. This is the approach we have taken thus far and I believe it has been successful. I will say, however, that drilling is going extrememly well, both in terms of metres achieved and the visible mineralisation in the core.

Diamond drilling is targeting shallow, gently-dipping mineralised formations, and will also test the underlying Precambrian basement which is known to be mineralised in places.\nHighlights\nThe drilling programme is designed to define sufficient resources for the planned 750 to 1,000 tonne per day Initial Mine development, whilst also starting the exploration and delineation of a larger scale resource as part of the Strategic Resource Strategy.\n\u00b7\nDiamond drilling has started, focusing on\noutcropping copper-mineralised strike\nand the down dip extensions\n\u00b7\nPhase 1 campaign is for 6,000 metres of diamond drilling, mostly as HQ core\n\u00b7\nDrill metres to be split between a local contractor rig and CMR's rig which will arrive soon from Western Canada\n\u00b7\nCMR expects to continue drilling after Phase 1 is completed, targeting a large scale resource of global significance\n\u00b7\nCMR has an Initial exploration target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper, at a 1.2% copper equivalent grade\nCharlie Long, CMR's CEO commented:\n\"We're very excited about our first drill programme, as we build a resource and fundamental value for our shareholders. Drill core will allow us to study the stratigraphy, petrology, metallurgy and also better understand the geological system and controls of mineralisation. Although, of course, at this stage it is the grade and geometry of the deposit that is our focus.\nOur initial exploration target assumes a 2.0m average thickness over a 4km2 area, in line with sedimentary copper deposits around the world, which are often relatively thin but laterally extensive. This 2.0m average will come from mineralised widths of 1.5m to >5.0m, with an expectation that most mineralised intersects will be in the 2.0m to 2.5m range.\nI wanted to highlight a few advantages of this project which are helping add value and lower execution risk. Easy topography and road access allowed us to prepare 50 drill pads in a few days. The target formations are shallow and gently dipping so most holes will be vertical and drilled to 50m or less, except in a few cases when we choose to test deeper parts of the basement. All in all, and assuming good results, the monetary cost of building a resource should be significantly lower at Agadir Melloul than most other projects out there.\"\nVideo and photos of drilling activity will be uploaded to our\nYouTube\nchannel\n-END-\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is focused on developing a sediment-hosted copper and silver project in Morocco.

CMR and the Joint Venture partner now have a dominant position in the Agadir Melloul district.\nIn recent days, over fifty drill pads have been prepared, a testament to our team on the ground and the project's favourable topography. Diamond core drilling will begin very shortly.\nHighlights:\nCMR is earning into 60% of the Agadir Melloul sedimentary copper project, previously referred to as the SHC Project, which CMR believes will develop into a significant new Moroccan sediment-hosted copper and silver discovery.\n\u00b7\nThe board and management team is reiterating its Initial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper at a 1.2% copper equivalent grade\nThe Joint Venture partner has completed sufficient exploration and technical work on the project to fast-track development and move straight into confirmatory drilling and feasibility studies. Key information:\n\u00b7\nTrench results include\ncopper and silver grades of 27m at 2.9% and 25 g/t; 12m at 1.9% and 61g/t; 10m at 1.5% and 12 g/t; 7m at 3.1% and 45 g/t; and 5m at 2.2% and 32 g/t\n\u00b7\nSurface and near surface mineralisation over a 1.5km strike length has been trenched and modelled by a leading Moroccan resource geologist, underpinning an initial 750 to 1,000 tonne per day open pit mine development plan (the 'Initial Mine')\n\u00b7\nFirst phase metallurgical test-work results include 80% copper and 61% silver recoveries resulting in concentrate containing 26% copper and 72g/t silver\n\u00b7\nWater pumps within the project boundaries demonstrate local availability of water\nAgadir Melloul is a geological analogue of the 130 million tonne Tizert Project, 55km to the west. The main shared geological characteristics are:\n\u00b7\nSediment hosted copper and silver systems\n\u00b7\nMineralisation found at and near the contact between the Precambrian basement and Infracambrian (c.550mya) sedimentary rocks\n\u00b7\nMineralisation, dominated by chalcopyrite, chalcocite, bornite and malachite, predominantly found in limestone, dolomite and conglomerate sediments\nIn addition to the three permits transferred into the SPV by the Joint Venture partner (\"CMC Permits\"), in recent weeks the SPV has acquired three new permits as well as securing exclusivity on a further six which are now undergoing technical due diligence. In summary:\n\u00b7\nTrenching and the initial copper-silver discovery made on the CMC Permits\n\u00b7\nThe Project's land package now consists of six permits, providing CMR and its Joint Venture partner with a dominant position in the Agadir Melloul district\n\u00b7\nThis six permit footprint is expected to increase in the short term, in part due to the six permits under exclusivity,\nwith permitted ground likely to exceed 150km2, of which >100km2 contains sedimentary rocks and the target Adoudounian unit\nCharlie Long, CMR's CEO commented:\n\"It is extremely pleasing to announce details of this game changing transaction, which moves CMR from rock-kicking explorer to project developer with an awesome asset. It has taken two years and a huge amount of work since we first visited Agadir Melloul to get to this point. And despite having visited many excellent projects, some of which we optioned and explored, Agadir Melloul has always been our priority target.\nTogether with our strategic investor, we believe the existing sampling data, derived mostly from trenching, underpins the initial mine project of a 750 to 1,000 tonnes per day flotation plant, and significantly derisks our investment. While the potential for a much larger discovery, which we are calling the strategic resource strategy, provides for a very exciting and potentially very high return investment case for both current and future shareholders.\nOnce drilling commences during the next week or two, assay results will be quick to follow and Agadir Melloul news flow shall be maintained in the months and years to come\".\nRussell Tucker commented:\n\"In recent weeks the team has secured exclusivity over six permits in the Agadir-Melloul district, transactions we have been working towards since Q3 2024. We also very recently completed the purchase of three further permits in the area and, as a result, now have six important permits and district control. We firmly believe that Agadir-Melloul will be a significant sedimentary copper discovery. Indeed, through trenching at Zone 1 the first discovery has already been made, and as such the CMR investment case is not simply exploration but rather resource definition and mine development.\nCMR's strategic input during the last nine months has resulted in a much larger proje",

CMR has now signed the formal joint venture agreement, under which CMR will earn-in to a sedimentary hosted copper deposit ('SHC') upon delivery of agreed milestones. Based on current information, the Company's board strongly believes that the SHC deposit will develop into a significant new discovery.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nFormal Joint Venture Agreement signed and CMR has received \u00a31.325m\n\u00b7\nCMR earning into 60% of a sedimentary copper and silver project (the 'Project')\n\u00b7\nDiamond drill rig acquired and due to be shipped (see Fig 2) from Canada next week\n\u00b7\nDrilling expected to start during Q3 2025\n\u00b7\nSufficient exploration data and development work on the Project to fast-track production and move straight into confirmatory drilling and a feasibility study\n\u00b7\nFast-track development of a 1,000 tpd copper flotation operation (the 'Initial Mine')\n\u00b7\nParallel campaign to delineate a large-scale strategic resource\n\u00b7\nInitial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper at 1.2% copper equivalent\n\u00b7\nThe Company welcomes Russell Tucker to the CMR board\nProject fundamentals\nShallow sedimentary copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) deposit. In some areas there is widespread surface mineralisation, allowing for open pit mining during the earlier stages of the mine plan. Maximum depth estimated to be 50m, which should ensure straightforward and productive exploration drilling using the Company's new Multi-Power HD Discovery diamond rig. The shallow nature of the deposit should also ensure relatively low reserve development and mine operating costs.\nOther important information includes a sealed road within 1km of the initial mining area, nearby grid power and water pump demonstrating local availability of water for operations. Note also that a scout drilling programme in 2023 hit water in sedimentary rocks.\nMoroccan expertise\nThe key to delivering the Project and to value creation for CMR shareholders is the strength of the Moroccan operations team, led by CMR's COO Noureddine Sabraoui. There is further expertise within the team in areas of mine development, mine management, exploration, geophysics, hydrogeology and general expertise in the sector.\nThe capabilities of the joint venture partner and Morocco's mining and geological services sector will also be key to the Project's success. The planned Initial Mine size of 750 to 1,000tpd is in line with Morocco's processing plant design and construction expertise. There are 10 flotation plants operating in the country, of which a number share similar copper-silver metallurgy to the Project. The main host rock is limestone which contains chalcopyrite, chalcocite and malachite, and with a sulphide to oxide ratio ranging from 80:20 to 70:30 (sulphide to oxide).\nFigure 1:\nProject rock samples\nNotes: rock samples from the Project showing different styles of mineralisation. From top left: A. high grade azurite and malachite B. chalcopyrite C. malachite\nD. chalcocite\nFast-tracked Initial Mine\nThe current owner and new joint venture partner has previously undertaken trenching, scout drilling and resource modelling work on one part of the Project, lowering the Project's level of exploration risk. Development work completed by the joint venture partner also supports a fast-track approach.\nCompleted works include:\n1. Metallurgical test work showing copper and silver recoveries1 of 80% and 61% respectively\n2. Submitted Environmental Impact Assessment and Feasibility Study2\n3. Secured land access rights3\n4. Received a turnkey estimate for a 750tpd copper flotation plant\n1\nrecoveries are expected to improve with further testwork, comminution and reagent optimisation\n2\nin compliance with Moroccan Law No. 33-13 and Law No. 49-17\n3\nland title over most of the Project's area belongs to the Moroccan Government, simplifying the long term lease process\nStrategic rationale\nCombining the above development works with the existing resource modelling (undertaken by one of Morocco's leading resource geologists), and a low strip open pit and shallow underground mining scenario, means the Company's board consider the Project is well positioned to be taken into production in the short term.\nThe Initial Mine is strategically expected to benefit the joint venture and CMR as follows:\n1. Positive free cashflow for the joint venture and CMR\n2. Cash generation to support the boot strapping of a larger operation\n3. The pursuit of a parallel strategy - production whilst building a strategic sized resource\nFigure 2:\nDiscovery HD - Track Mounted Diamond Core Drill\nNotes: the Company's second-hand refurbished unit in manufacturer's warehouse; XP drill head wit",

This involved field work on the Critical Mineral Resources (\"CMR\") portfolio, which sits within our subsidiary Atlantic Research Minerals, but primarily consisted of the assessment of multiple base metals and speciality metals opportunities across the country. By late Q3 the Board had started negotiations with the owner of what we believe to be a special copper development opportunity, a view based on the style of mineralisation, the scale potential and the trenching and mapping work completed by the current owner. We also collected our own data during several months of due diligence and formed our own assessment on the deposit's metallurgy.\nWe actually first visited the project in Q2 2023 and expressed our interest in entering a joint venture shortly afterwards. However, the owner wanted to complete its work programme to understand the grade and scale potential, and the project's overall economic feasibility, an internal study which it completed and shows excellent financial returns.\nOur small team, which although sadly not omniscient, believes there is potential for many very good metals projects in Morocco, yet is very confident that this project is amongst the best. Negotiations have continued into Q1 2025 culminating in us entering into an exclusive, conditional term sheet which, once conditions have been satisfied will allow us to proceed with the formal transaction. Due to the work carried out in 2023 and 2024, the potential\u00a0transaction has substantial exploration history including trenching and limited drilling which demonstrate continuity and ore-grade copper over a multi kilometre strike length. The orebody is shallow, gently dipping, open down dip and supportive of low Capex development and a very significant discovery.\nThe permits have been secured through an exclusivity agreement, and the target is a large copper deposit. The project is an analogue of an existing large and proximal development project, and the Board is confident this conditional transaction will transform CMR.\nAn initial exploration target of 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper equivalent at circa 1.20%, open pittable and shallow underground, has been calculated by our team. Although this is a target, and there is both upside and downside risk to this number, the work undertaken thus far strongly suggests whatever happens with the drill bit, there is sufficient tonnage and grade to take this project into production on an industrial scale. This fits perfectly with CMR's main strategy of securing one or more high quality development opportunities to complement the earlier stage projects in the portfolio.\nI believe the project represents one of the best undeveloped copper projects in Morocco and is transformational for CMR. Although, the Company\u00a0cannot\u00a0yet\u00a0provide a detailed update\u00a0until the conditions are met, the\u00a0CMR Board would like to assure investors it will provide more details\u00a0and positive news shortly, once the outstanding conditions have been achieved. This will be followed by an exciting drill programme which once started is likely to continue until the end of 2025 and into 2026. Given the shallow nature of the mineralisation, we anticipate low cost drilling and a quick turnaround from drilling to assay results.\nOther activities during the year included a review of the Hesperis Portfolio, due diligence at the high grade silver Igli Project and building up the metals and minerals trading business. These remain important to CMR and we will provide more material updates in due course. However, we have been prioritising our time and most of our capital on securing this company-making copper transaction, carrying out the due diligence and investments necessary to deliver a signed and announced formal earn-in agreement in the short term.\nConsolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2023\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nContinuing operations:\nAdministrative expen",

The Company will continue to focus all its efforts on Morocco.\nFinancing Cashflows\nThe first \u00a3425,000, which has been received by the Company, has been provided via the issue of loan notes, convertible into ordinary shares of the Company at \u00a30.011 per share, maturing on 31 December 2028 (\"CLNs\"). The CLNs attract interest of 15% per annum (which accrues) and have one warrant for every two ordinary shares represented by the principal amount of CLNs. Each of the warrants will be exercisable at a price of \u00a30.013 until 31 December 2028 (\"\nFirst Tranche CLNs\n\").\nThe balance of \u00a32,075,000 (\"\nSubsequent Finance\n\") is structured as follows:\n\u00a31,325,000 is expected in the second quarter of 2025 (the \"\nSecond Tranche Investment\n\") and will consist of an \u00a3825,000 subscription for new ordinary shares at a price of 1.45p, and \u00a3500,000 to be provided through a second loan instrument, convertible at 1.45p and with 5% accruing interest.\nThe third tranche of \u00a3750,000 will be invested in the first quarter of 2026 through a subscription for new ordinary shares at a price of 1.53p.\nThe Subsequent Finance is contingent on the Company entering into a formal agreement on one or more development projects in Morocco, most likely to be copper or manganese. The Investor may choose to accelerate the provision of the Subsequent Finance, depending on the capital requirements of the Company.\nIf the issue of ordinary shares to the Investor would bring their shareholding above 29.9% and require them to make a mandatory offer for the Company under the Takeover Code, the ratio of ordinary shares to convertible loan notes to be subscribed for would be adjusted to ensure that this does not occur.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to have secured this strategic investment which will allow CMR to deliver an exciting business development story throughout the remainder of 2025 and beyond. The main challenge for junior mining companies is securing sufficient finance to fund exploration and development work, whether on their own assets or as part of an earn-in. CMR is now in the excellent position of being well-financed, enabling it to focus on creating value in Morocco and executing on some extremely exciting opportunities\".\nRussell Tucker from the Gilini Investment Team\nshared their enthusiasm for investing in CMR and Morocco, stating, \"\nWe are thrilled to support CMR as we see immense untapped potential in Morocco, particularly for copper. Following thorough due diligence, we have full confidence in CMR's leadership to unlock this opportunity. At Gilini Holdings, we focus on world-class assets and building exceptional teams, and we look forward to applying our expertise in close collaboration with CMR's executive team to maximise success\".\nExisting Convertible Loan Instruments\nFurther to the announcement in the Company's interims on 30 September 2024, the Company confirms that of the undrawn \u00a3500,000 convertible loan notes from 17 July 2024 (the \"2024 CLNs\"), \u00a3425,000 have not been drawn and will therefore be cancelled, and effectively be replaced with the First Tranche CLNs announced today. The Investor's provision of the First Tranche CLNs is therefore aligned with that of the 2024 CLNs noteholders.\nThe Company also announces that, further to an agreed amendment with noteholders of the terms, the 2024 CLNs convertible instrument has been amended to increase the coupon to 15% and extend the redemption date to 31 December 2025.\nThe Company has existing 2024 CLNs including capitalised interest outstanding of \u00a3230,327 with the following terms:\n\u00b7\nRedemption Date: 31 December 2025\n\u00b7\nConversion: any time after the Issue Date but prior to the Maturity Date on 31 December 2025\n\u00b7\nConversion Price: 1.1p\n\u00b7\nInterest: 15% coupon\n- ENDS -\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes to Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce critical minerals for the global economy, including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

This has led to multiple new trading opportunities and the Company now intends\nto expand this profitable business during 2025. The Joint Venture's focus has been on low-risk and short-term trading opportunities in order to provide a proof of concept. Whilst a conservative approach to risk will continue, the near-term objective is now to scale up the trading business with multiple small mines that have potential for good tonnage and high-grade products in a range of metals and potentially industrial minerals. With this is mind the management have commenced discussions with a number of potential providers for additional working capital.\nCharlie Long (CEO) commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by the achievement of our commodities trading business in such a short timescale. Given our Moroccan team's metals trading background, we have known of the potential for some time and always planned to enter the space. The benefits of having a local JV partner with a long history of trading in metals and industrial minerals is now very clear. As we continue to gain traction, we are investigating sources of non-dilutive capital that would enable a step-change in scale. That said, our organic growth trajectory is working extremely well and we will not take undue risk. Further details of our expansion plans will be provided to shareholders in due course\".\nSmall-scale mining and our social license\nMorocco's artisanal and small-scale operators work alongside larger industrial scale mines. Our partners have unrivalled knowledge of the cultural practices of the rural mining economy and a deep understanding of Moroccan commodities commerce. This gives CMR a distinct competitive advantage.\nDespite being the core fabric of the sector, small scale mining in Morocco remains undercapitalised and will benefit from actors such as CMR with high EISA standards.\nThe commercial objective is to create an efficient mine to end-user pathway that is beneficial to all parties by developing a profitable business while maintaining these high social standards and building long term relationships.\nBackground\nDue to Morocco's stability and status as a favoured trading partner of the EU, the US and China, there is extremely good demand for Moroccan-produced exports including metal concentrates and critical materials.\nMorocco is a tier one jurisdiction for metals exploration, development and mining. In the well respected and most recent 2023 Fraser Institute's latest mining survey, Morocco ranks 27th in the 'Investment Attractiveness Index' globally and 2nd in Africa for both overall investment and policy. In the Fraser 'Policy Perception Index', Morocco's score increased by 6 points and now ranks 12th (out of 86 jurisdictions), an improvement from 17th (of 62 jurisdictions) in 2022.\nMorocco's mining industry includes phosphate (OCP Group), manganese, barite (chemical and petroleum grades), lead-zinc, copper-silver, gold-silver (Aya Gold & Silver), oligiste, cobalt and gold. There is also production of antimony, tungsten and industrial minerals such as feldspar, fluorspar and gypsum. The map below shows the main mine regions and deep-water ports that handle the majority of Morocco's exported metals and minerals.\nPartnership in Morocco\nIn recent months the Company has taken a series of initiatives to create a self-sufficient and increasingly profitable commodities trading business. Central to this has been the creation of a formal profit-sharing partnership with an established Moroccan trading entity to identify, acquire and trade a range of metals and industrial minerals. Our partners have over a decade experience in sourcing and, where necessary, upgrading crude mineral ores and semi-processed raw materials secured from the small-scale mines, artisanal miners and aggregators.\nFig 1: Morocco mining map\nSource: Company\nCONTACT:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

The commodities trading complements CMR's core strategy of acquiring and developing prospective mining projects in Morocco.\nCommodities trading\nCMR has capitalised on the board's experience and knowledge of the domestic mining industry to source metal and mineral concentrates and raw ores from Morocco's distinct mining regions, for marketing either through the Casablanca commodities market or directly to international customers.\nThe trading involves buying and selling raw ore and concentrates from small scale miners and aggregators before selling the material at the most favourable payment terms available.\nLead mining in Morocco\nFollowing the recent announcements relating to antimony and copper, the Company has now undertaken its first transaction in high-grade lead concentrate.\nThis trade is consistent with our strategy of sourcing material from smaller producers and, where appropriate, deploying our joint venture partner's established concentrating facilities. The transaction is one of several being undertaken this year, and it positions CMR as a modest, but expanding and ambitious, trading entity in Morocco.\nCharlie Long (CEO) commented: \"\nWe are delighted to have undertaken our first lead trade, a product stream that has the potential to grow very significantly given Morocco's lead production levels. I'd like to highlight that the three trades announced over the last few days reflect our team's experience and reach in the Moroccan mining and metals-trading sectors. This expertise will also be the key to CMR's future success in mine development, in terms of securing our preferred project and progressing it quickly and efficiently for the benefit of shareholders\".\nLead background\nMorocco is a significant producer of lead, exporting approximately 120,000 tonnes of lead concentrate in 2022, mostly from three districts (i) Touissit Bou and Beker in the north east, close to the border with Algeria (ii) the Aouli Mibladen area near Midelt, and (iii) the Aouam area south of Meknes.\nDomestic consumption of lead is modest, with the ceramics industry of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9 region the main consumer for the fabrication of pottery glazes. Most crude ore and lead concentrates are exported. In 2022 Morocco was the 13th largest exporter of crude lead ore and concentrates globally, with Germany, South Korea and Italy its major trading partners.\nLead is seen by CMR as one of five priority opportunities for near-term sales growth alongside manganese, zinc, copper, antimony and various industrial minerals.\nFig 1: Morocco mining map\nSource: Company\nCONTACT:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

The commodities trading complements CMR's core strategy of acquiring and developing prospective mining projects in Morocco.\nCopper trade\nThe Company has now undertaken a\ntransaction whereby high-quality copper ore grading between 5% and 10% copper, has been sourced from a small scale mine in the Anti-Atlas. The product has been purchased and the sale is agreed.\nThe commodities trading strategy is based on its joint venture partnership with an established local Moroccan trading company which sources commodities. CMR's team and the JV partner work together with negotiations, quality control, upgrading, storage, transport and shipping logistics.\nCopper demand\nValued for its conductivity, malleability and recyclability, copper is essential in renewable energy, electric vehicles and general increased electrification. Copper demand from cleantech is projected to escalate substantially from 6.3 million tonnes in 2023 to 16.3 million tonnes by 2040 (International Energy Agency, 2024), in line with the global energy transformation. This is expected to drive total copper demand from approximately 26 million tonnes today to 36 million tonnes in 15 years time, whilst maturing mines, declining ore-quality and a lack of new discoveries impact supply.\nTransaction\nThis copper transaction is consistent with the strategy of sourcing raw material from smaller producers and, where necessary, upgrading lower-grade products using our partner's operational concentrating facility.\nThis current trade, one of several to be completed in the coming weeks, was undertaken through our partnership that is now beginning to scale its activities and the scope of materials sourced and supplied to overseas markets.\nCharlie Long (CEO) commented:\nWe are pleased to report a further transaction by our commodities group. Moving into copper illustrates how nimble and well connected our Moroccan partnership is, and the potential for the business to grow into something important. CMR intends to fully exploit our early-mover position as an integrated mine developer and commodities trader with a unique business-focused approach to deliver value for our shareholders.\nCommodities trading disclosures\nThe commodities marketplace in Morocco, as elsewhere, is competitive so details of the trades adopted by CMR, for example the pricing structures, are intellectual property. CMR will publish certain information periodically in accordance with its statutory duties, however it will not release detailed data where this may disadvantage the competitive position of the Company. Nor will details of the locations of our sources and counterparties be released unless it is required by law or beneficial to the Company's shareholders. The Company will deliver a further trading update shortly and details of expansion plans early in Q1, 2025.\nMorocco background\nMorocco is a politically stable, welcoming and forward-looking country with multiple base metals mines, most of which are small-scale. Exports of copper from Morocco were valued at $157 million in 2023 mostly as concentrate. This is expected to increase as Managem's large Tizert copper-silver mine completes construction and ramps up to full production.\nMorocco intends to be a part of the evolving copper story and the billions of US Dollars of investment needed annually to achieve the widely targeted emissions net-zero target by 2050. In 2023, the global copper market was valued at >US$200 billion but copper's story is evolving and growing with the new frontier of Clean Energy technologies. These include low-carbon power generation, solar photovoltaics, wind and other renewables, expanded and upgraded electricity networks, electric vehicles and battery storage.\nCONTACT:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

The Company has agreed an exclusive, renewable six (6) month supply contract to purchase all crude ore mined at this source.\nThe antimony ore is a saleable\nsemi-massive stibnite (antimony sulphide / Sb2S3) product.\nAntimony opportunity\nThe antimony metal price has more the trebled over the past year due to an acute shortage of supply, primarily reflecting export restrictions from China which produces circa 48% of global mined antimony (stibnite ores and concentrate) and in recent years >50% of refined antimony (as antimony trioxide and antimony metal). Based on Fastmarkets' benchmark pricing, antimony ingot (min. 99.65% Sb) Rotterdam hit $38,000 per tonne in early December 2024, up from $11,500 per tonne last year.\nThis exclusive supply agreement creates a new opportunity for CMR to occupy a space in a specialist commodities market where the supply - demand dynamic is becoming ever more problematic for Western countries. Antimony trading is expected to generate an above average gross profit margin when compared with other opportunies we are seeing.\nCommodities trading\nThis antimony contract is consistent with the stated strategy of sourcing product from small and artisanal producers and, if necessary, upgrading lower-grade products using our partner's operational concentrating facility.\nThe trading arm of the Company is now fully operational, ready to expand its activities and the scope of materials to be sourced and supplied to customers. Exports are planned to Europe, Asia and to other international markets including North America. This initial agreement is the first of several transactions projected before the calendar year end. The Company will deliver a further trading update before the year end and expansion plans will be outlined in Q1, 2025.\nCharlie Long (CEO) commented: \"\nWe are excitied to be entering the\nantimony\nmarket, a commodity which is so critical at this time and which fits our strategy of diversification into trading. Not only will the commodities trading generate cash for the business, it will also add to our already excellent dealflow. Giving us unrivalled access to producing assets across Morocco, some of which will have potential for larger scale development. In this way CMR will exploit its unique position as an integrated mine developer and commodities trader, always focusing on delivering value for shareholders.\nWe anticipate entering into more trading agreements over the coming weeks and look forward to updating our shareholders\".\nAntimony the Critical Mineral\nAntimony supply is classified as critical by the U.S. and European Union. Both countries are currently totally reliant on antimony imports which is used in batteries, semi-conductors, alloys, flame retardants, communication equipment, ammunitions and defence equipment.\nIn 2023 global antimony mined production was 83,000 tonnes of which China produced 40,000 tonnes or 48% of global mine production. Tajikistan is the second largest producer of mined antimony with 21,000 tonnes in 2023.\nFig 1: Antimony hand sample\nSource: Company\nCONTACT:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

Capitalising on the Board's experience and knowledge of Morocco's mining industry, the Company has formed a partnership with a Moroccan trading company.\nTogether we will source metal and mineral concentrates and raw ores from Morocco's distinct mining regions and arrange delivery to the customer. These will consist of buyers who take delivery in Morocco as well as shipments overseas.\nJoint venture agreement\nThe Company has entered into a joint venture agreement with the aforementioned Moroccan company, which has access to sources of mined materials and international customers. Our profit share agreement will be 70% to the Company and 30% to our partner.\nThe joint venture's trading strategy will initially focus on low-risk and short term trading opportunities, aggregating product from smaller producers and upgrading lower grade products using our partner's operational concentrating facility. Amongst other aspects, profit margins will depend on the type of trading activity but will range from 3% up to 20% in some cases. The trading arm of the Company is now operational and is expected to deliver several trades over the coming weeks which will lead to trading updates later this year and next.\nMine development opportunities\nThe Company has made excellent headway in its strategy to secure one or more high quality development opportunities. Although it is not yet ready to provide a detailed update, the Board would like to assure investors that progress has been achieved and the Company expects to provide significant, positive news during Q1 2025.\n\u200b\nCharlie Long (CEO) commented:\nAlthough reaching this milestone has taken longer than expected, we are extremely pleased to be adding a cash generating business to the company which has the potential to grow into something substantive. There are multiple examples of successful trading companies which started in a similar manner.\nThe Moroccan mining industry presents a range of specific opportunities based on its natural resources, and the resultant mining and minerals trading activities. CMR has the enviable advantage of a COO who is embedded in this sector, someone who has metals trading, mine management, permitting and geological expertise. Our Moroccan operations, and equally our shareholders, benefit from this experience and from the protection it brings.\nOur new JV partner has a long history of trading in manganese, lead-zinc, barite, speciality metals, oligiste and other industrial minerals. Our first trade is likely to involve a speciality metal, although trades in zinc and lead are also being considered.\nBackground\nMorocco's mining industry includes phosphate (OCP Group), manganese, barite (chemical and petroleum grades), lead-zinc, zinc-lead, copper-silver, gold-silver (Aya Gold & Silver), oligiste, cobalt and gold. There is also production of antimony, tungsten and industrial minerals such as feldspar, fluorspar and gypsum. The map below shows the main mine regions and deep water ports that handle the majority of Morocco's exported metals and minerals.\nFig 1: Morocco simplified mining regions\nSource: Company\nRelated party\nNoureddine Sabraoui, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, is a 50% beneficial owner of the Moroccan trading company. As such, the joint venture agreement is considered to be a Related Party Transaction. The directors of CMR confirm that having exercised reasonable care, skill and diligence, that the transaction is fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of Critical Mineral Resources PLC are concerned.\nCONTACT:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

Net cash outflow from operations totalled \u00a3212,437 in H1 2024 (2023 H1: \u00a3343,382)\n;\n\u00b7\nTotal funds raised during the period amounted to \u00a3253,261 (gross), which included \u00a3100,233 from shares held by the Company\n; and\n\u00b7\nAppointment of Dominic Traynor as the Executive Chairman of the Company.\nPost Period\n\u00b7\nOn July 17, 2024, the Company secured an exclusive option to acquire the Igli Project, a potentially high-grade silver and copper project in the highly prospective Saghro region. Initial prospecting has delivered impressive results, with grades reaching up to 912 g/t silver and 2.97% copper, positioning Igli as a key focus for the Company going forward; and\n\u00b7\nThe Company successfully raised \u00a31,000,000 through the issuance of convertible loan notes, aimed at bolstering working capital and supporting key capital expenditures, including the ongoing exploration at Igli. To date, \u00a3500,000 of the proceeds has been drawn down, ensuring strong financial reserves.\nDirectors' Responsibility Statement\nThe Directors confirm that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 4.2.8, namely:\n\u00b7\nAn indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nMaterial related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.\nThe interim report was approved by the Board of Directors and the above responsibility statement was signed on its behalf by:\nDominic Traynor\nExecutive Chairman\n30 September 2024\nDominic Traynor, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"\nI am privileged to step into the role of Chairman at such a pivotal time for Critical Mineral Resources. Our activities in Morocco continue to show significant promise, underscoring the country's strategic importance as a growing supplier of metal, minerals and critical materials to Europe, the US and further afield. Our progress thus far, along with future acquisitions, convince me that the Company has a very exciting future.\nI sincerely thank our shareholders for their continued trust and support. Together, we are building a solid foundation for long-term growth, and I am eager to lead CMR through this next phase of development\".\nCharles Long, Chief Executive, commented:\n\"\nThe company made solid progress in the first half of 2024 with a strong focus on identifying good quality development projects in Morocco that could become mid to large-scale industrial mining operations. Copper remains a priority due to growing global demand and challenges faced by older mines in places like Peru and Chile, including deepening reserves and declining ore grades.\nDespite this, forecasting commodity prices very often ends in failure, which is why we assess each project with current market conditions in mind.\nMorocco presents a wealth of mining opportunities, many of which align with both US and EU critical mineral lists. However, we remain open to developing valuable projects where the metal, for example silver, may not currently be on those lists. Our primary goal is to create value for both our shareholders and Moroccan stakeholders\".\nFor further information, please contact:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler\u00a0(Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC\u00a0is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

Samples collected during our visits in January and July returned very high grade silver and good copper assays, which along with Igli's location near two important mines, gives us reason to be excited. The recent funding will allow us to systematically explore the property, building-up a high quality, valuable, database which will more importantly generate drilling targets.\nWe continue to see new and negotiate on other significant opportunities, including those which can be brought into production relatively quickly. The recent fundraise will enable these activities while we progress Igli. We look forward to updating shareholders as Phase 1 progresses over the coming weeks and months.\"\nIgli Project potential\nIn addition to the exciting high silver grades discovered from recent sampling, the Company's geological team is encouraged by previously recorded copper showings in different parts of the Igli property and the existence of widespread NE-SW faulting, which act as one of the controls for mineralisation in the region.\nAs previously reported, Igli is located along strike from the Tiouit (Tiwit) and Imiter mines, both characterised by high grades. Imiter was once one of the highest grade silver mines in the world and is located only 25km to the north east. Tiwit is 5km away and mainly a gold mine with silver and copper credits.\nFig 1: Igli Project access\nSource: Company\nFig 2: Local map\nSource: Company\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

It underscores its considerable momentum in\u00a0Morocco, where it has become the partner of choice for development assets after accumulating an extensive Morrocan portfolio with multiple commodities critical for Western economies and the energy transition.\nConcurrently the Company has also raised \u00a3750,000 through the issue of a convertible loan note to fund the Company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements including for exploration programmes at Igli. A significant proportion of this investment will come from Prism Group AG, a Swiss and UAE based private investment office with a long-term and patient investment approach. Separately, today the Company has announced the move of Dominic Traynor, currently Non-Executive Chairman, to Executive Chairman.\nIgli highlights\n\u00b7\nIgli Project (or 'Igli') is a strategically located, silver and copper project, on the same structural corridor as the Tiouit (or 'Tiwit') Mine and Imiter Mine - one of the highest grade and largest silver mines in the world.\n\u00b7\nCMR has secured a sixteen (16) month exclusive option to carry out geochem, geophysics and drilling before main acquisition payment.\n\u00b7\nVery encouraging initial sampling at Igli. Grades acquired by CMR channel sampling and sampling of stockpiles include 912g/t silver and 2.97% copper, 496g/t silver and 3.34% copper, 741g/t silver and 3.21% copper.\n\u00b7\nRegional geology suggests three potential targets at Igli (1) higher grade sub-vertical shear zones (2) lower grade basalt formation (3) deeper basement hosted shear zones, as found at the Tiwit and Imiter mines 6.5km and 25km along strike.\n\u00b7\nIgli's combination of high grade mineralisation within the shear zones and lower grade mineralisation in the basalt formation is very encouraging for a successful exploration project.\n\u00b7\nIgli Project consists of a 10.04km2 Mining License and an adjacent 5.96km2 exploration permit (Permis de Recherche) for 16km2 in total.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to have secured exclusivity and an option over the Igli Project as one of the highest grade prospects we have seen over the last 12 months. Its location, directly along strike from Tiwit and Imiter adds to its prospectivity, as does the fact that this part of the Saghro Massif has seen relatively limited exploration and even less drilling or geophysics work over the years. We are also encouraged by the multiple targets at Igli namely the vertical shear zones which should have depth extension and the mineralised basalt formation which has the potential to be widespread.\"\nGuy Rothschild, Chief Operating Officer of Prism Group, commented:\n\"We are delighted to become CMR's main strategic investor. CMR has a fantastic opportunity in Morocco, and potentially further afield, thanks to management's blend of skills, sector experience and deal flow. The silver-copper option announced today is very exciting and reflects this Moroccan expertise. Although Prism's largest investment is in the financials sector, our shareholders have extensive mining experience, and we also have a strong mining network, including potential co-investors across the GCC and north Africa. We envisage working closely with CMR and, to that end, strongly support Dominic's move to an executive role and his increased involvement.\"\nTransaction summary\nCMR expects to acquire 90% of the Igli Project based on the following terms:\n1. US$12,000 Exclusivity Payment in cash granting CMR approximately two months exclusivity (until 13th September 2024) to undertake legal due diligence of the Property.\n2.\nUS$80,000 exclusive Option Payment granting CMR 14 months from 13th September 2024 to acquire a 90% interest in the Property in return for a 90% Cash Payment of US$560,000. This can be exercised at any time.\n3. Seven months following 13th September 2024, if the exclusive Option has not yet been exercised and therefore the US$560,000 not been paid, a US$60,000 Option Maintenance Fee is payable to maintain the exclusive Option for a further 7 months. This US$60,000 is deductible from the US$560,000 90% Cash Payment.\n4. A Final Payment of US$150,000 is due 6 months following the 90% Cash Payment in either cash or equity at the vendor's discretion.\n5. CMR has the right to acquire the fina",

With the Company's clear focus on taking opportunities to develop commodities urgently required for Western economies, and reflecting our progress, it was only appropriate to change the Company name to Critical Mineral Resources PLC (\"CMR\"), on 17 August 2023. I am delighted to have recently taken the position of Chairman following the year of progress and with so much opportunity ahead.\nThe sale of the Cyprus assets during the period marked a significant milestone for the Company and enabled the leadership team to concentrate on its strategy of evaluating and acquiring development opportunities in the critical metals sector.\nMindful of the Company's human and financial resources, CMR undertook a strategic review analysing appropriate jurisdictions where the Company could fully focus. This included analysis of jurisdictions that offer substantial resource opportunities, are not constrained by geopolitical sensitivities and have developed downstream and customer markets nearby. As part of this exercise, CMR also took the difficult decision not to pursue the opportunity to develop its RIWAQ Al Mawarid for Mining (\"RIWAQ\") portfolio of exploration licence applications in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia due to the large size of the portfolio, which our Board deemed unfeasible for CMR's current resources.\nFollowing the completion of the strategic review in June, the Company entered\u00a0the Moroccan market via the 80% acquisition of a local Moroccan exploration company, Atlantic Research Minerals (\"ARM\"), led by a highly regarded Moroccan geologist with a deep understanding of the region. Morocco is an excellent jurisdiction for upstream and longer-term midstream battery materials projects. Critically, it has deposits of copper, manganese, cobalt and other critical metals and minerals. However, the well-mineralised geology is largely under-explored. Morocco's\u00a0main trading partner is the\u00a0European Union, and its modern infrastructure, proximity to\u00a0Europe, and political stability make it an excellent country in which CMR can operate. During 2023, Morocco continued to gain significant recognition from global organisations as a battery commodity and materials hub, as evidenced by several large-scale investments from multinational organisations operating in the battery supply chain.\nIn the second half of the year, CMR gained momentum in building an extensive portfolio of projects proving the geological potential of the Moroccan regions where the Company is prospecting and the strong know-how of its Moroccan subsidiary ARM. After extensive exploration during the summer months, the Company announced it had staked several research permits, from which it kept the Ighrem Permit. The Ighrem permit is 16km2\u00a0and contains high-grade manganese and barite mineralisation. It is also prospective for copper and silver. At the same time, CMR announced that it had entered into binding heads of terms on the\u00a0Anzar Project, a potentially exciting high-grade copper-silver project in central\u00a0Morocco. This earn-in approach allows CMR to take majority equity stakes for modest investment sums, and only once C",

Prospecting by CMR's geological team has demonstrated copper and silver in multiple shear zone and quartz vein structures with some structures containing gold mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nChannel samples include assay results of (1) 3.1% copper and 17 g/t silver (2) 1.95% copper and 15 g/t silver, and (3) 0.86 g/t gold and 21 g/t silver. These initial samples are demonstrative of Ifri's potential.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is pleased to see copper and silver grades returned at Ifri given the incidence of visible copper sulphide and copper oxide mineralisation on the property and Ifri's proximity to the Tagmout copper-silver mine.\n\u00b7\nThe presence of gold in the system is also extremely encouraging given nearby industrial scale and artisanal underground gold mining. Existing mines are targeting the quartz structures with gold grades in the region known to improve at depth.\n\u00b7\nThe Ifri Project is located in a well-known mining belt which hosts active and previously operating mines. These include the Imiter silver mine, the Tiouit gold mine, the Bou Skour copper project and the Tagmout silver-copper project less than 5.0km away from Ifri.\nIfri Project summary\nInitial prospecting at the Ifri site has identified multiple large mineralised shear structures with copper oxide, copper sulphide, silver and gold mineralisation. Historical small scale mining for copper and gold is also evident at numerous locations across the property and, significantly, there is a significant scale drilling programme 2.5km west of the permit and an underground gold mine being developed less than 10km north of the permit. We have located these operations but the project names are unknown and it is unclear who the operators are.\nFig 1 Ifri Project mineralisation\nSource: Critical Mineral Resources PLC\nSaghro Massif Potential\nIfri is located within the Saghro Massif, an area of old (Precambrian) igneous rocks in the Anti-Atlas. In a relatively small area, this series of inliers hosts multiple past producing mines, operational mines and development projects. Probably the most well-know mines are the Imiter silver mine and the Tiouit gold mine. The Bou Skour copper project and Tagmout copper-silver project are also significant deposits and located very close to Ifri. Figure 3 illustrates Ifri's location within an alteration hot spot, where NE-SW faults are thought to represent paths for hydrothermal fluids and mineralisation.\nFig 2 Saghro Massif mining belt\nSource: Critical Mineral Resources PLC\nFig 3 Ifri's location and mineral prospectivity map\nSource: Mamouch, Y.; Attou, A.; Miftah, A.; Ouchchen, M.; Dadi, B.; Achkouch, L.; Et-tayea, Y.; Allaoui, A.; Boualoul, M.; Randazzo, G.; et al.

Ifri is located in a mineralised system and we will now focus on systematic exploration and drill target generation. We are encouraged by the numerous mines in this belt, several of which are intrusion-related deposits, and therefore the region's strong potential for large scale discoveries. At Ifri, we will be targeting both mineralised structures near the surface and richer sources of copper, silver and gold at depth\".\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities essential for renewable energy, battery storage and electrification to support the clean energy revolution.

Prospecting by CMR's geological team demonstrates copper and silver in multiple quartz vein and shear zone structures with some zones assaying for gold.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is also in discussions with a leading global commodity trading group that would like CMR to act as its Moroccan partner to source and supply certain minerals for its global supply chain. Trading in metals and potentially industrial minerals, either in a partnership or individually, provides the Company with an opportunity for near-term cash flows.\n\u00b7\nIfri Project located in an alteration hotspot and initial channel sampling included an assay of 3.1% copper and 17 g/t silver.\n\u00b7\nThe Ifri Project is in an active mining belt which hosts four active and seven previously operating mines of copper, silver and gold.\nBackground to the Placing and use of proceeds\nOn 16 January 2024, the Company announced it had acquired 26 exploration permits\nin central Morocco\nprospective for copper, antimony, tungsten, lead-zinc and gold via the acquisition of\nHesperis Resources SARL, a Moroccan company. The acquisition transforms the Morrocan footprint of CMR's incubator portfolio and its exposure to a wider range of critical metals and minerals. It also cements CMR's position as one of the region's leading developers of critical minerals.\nIfri Project mineralisation\nCMR remains focused on developing Morrocan clean energy and critical minerals projects that offer significant scale potential. Accordingly, and following in-depth analysis, the Company has concluded the Ifri Project meets these criteria. Initial prospecting at the Ifri site located multiple large copper mineralised shear structures with copper oxide, copper sulphide, silver and gold mineralisation.\nNet proceeds from the Placing will enable a complete mapping and geochemical survey of the project area. Ifri benefits from established local road and power infrastructure.\nMorocco operations\nIn the last 9 months, the Company has gained significant momentum in Morroco. It now has a considerable geological understanding of the region's potential as a global commodities hub. Furthermore, it has extensive relationships within the mining sector at a domestic level. This regional Intellectual Property and know-how has led to the Company receiving interest from a leading global commodity trading group to become its Morrocan partner and supply it with commodities from the region\n. CMR is now in discussions to formalise the partnership.\nPDMR Dealing & KM Securities Pty Ltd\nKM Securities Pty Ltd\u00a0('KM Securities'), in which\u00a0Russell Thomson, a Non-Executive Director of the Company is a 50% shareholder, acquired 2,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company as part of this Placing.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"I would like to thank our existing shareholders for their support and welcome new shareholders to the register. The net proceeds from the Fundraising will accelerate the significant Morrocan opportunities CMR has successfully created and advanced in recent months. As a specialist Morrocan exploration and development company, we remain focused on developing projects and opportunities that offer the prospect for meaningful production of critical commodities and near-term cash generation. We are delighted with our recent progress and are confident the fundraise will further enhance our Morrocan momentum.\"\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) plc is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities essential for renewable energy, battery storage and electrification to support the clean energy revolution.

Looking at the raise as a whole, \u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini - nearly \u00a310m.

In Morocco we're definitely at the lower end of that scale, especially for an existing mine (not exclusively Au). With Au at $4300/oz, even Dianne Abbott could work out there's a very good margin if they decide to target the gold.

What matters is that these sells are being met by steady buying at the same levels and higher. Despite visible supply and intraday spread widening, 2.5p is acting as a defended level, with buyers stepping into supply rather than waiting lower. If this was uncontrolled placing overhang, the price would already be below the placing price. Instead, demand is absorbing supply. Net effect: placing pressure looks to be easing, not increasing. On current volumes, the bulk of the overhang should clear over the next couple of months, potentially sooner if drilling / JORC momentum picks up. (The next set of assay results are expected in early February.) Once this phase ends, the share price should start reacting properly to news again.",

          "content": "Worth separating what is confirmed by RNS from what is inferred. Prior to the Shard-led raise, CMRS did not have balance sheet capacity to pursue acquisitions and aggressively drill Agadir Melloul. After the raise \u00a32.925m gross does allow selective bolt-on acquisitions. But not \u201clarge\u201d or transformational deals without further equity or JV structures. Morocco is genuinely rich in under-explored copper/gold assets. CMRS does have in-country expertise Mr Noureddine, but quality assets are not cheap unless distressed, and competition from majors/juniors is rising. Majors and mid-tiers are re-entering the country, looking for advanced, low-risk projects (eg CMRS after JORC) Juniors are trying to lock up ground early and competing for the best sediment-hosted systems. This does not mean majors are buying early-stage explorers left and right. It means Good assets get noticed faster once they cross certain technical thresholds. JORC is the first of those thresholds, not the last, which is where CMRS is aiming to be by mid\u2013late 2026. CMRS would be more JV-friendly than outright M&A at this stage Majors and credible mid-tiers care about five things, in roughly this order: 1.\tScale (tonnage potential, not just grade) 2.\tMining simplicity (open pit, low strip) 3.\tCapex intensity (can it be built cheaply?) 4.\tJurisdiction (Morocco scores well) 5.\tStrategic fit (district control or mill feed) The investment case strengthens materially if CMRS ticks all five. Gillini has been a strategic supporter. Post-prospectus approval, insiders can participate. RNS confirms continued support of a strategic major shareholder, but that could be equity, loan, or structured. \u201c\u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini\u201d Is this supported by any RNS ? What is actually confirmed \u00a32.925m raised at 2.25p, not 3.45p. Warrants at 4.5p are potential future cash, not current. Serious interest does exist, but \u00a310m is not in the bank. CMRS is properly funded to reach JORC. Acquisition optionality now exists. Insider alignment is likely positive. Currently maybe don\u2019t price in a \u00a39-\u00a310 Million war chest or guaranteed Gillini funding beyond disclosed terms. However the market will value CMRS on JORC quality, not BB arithmetic.",

          "content": "Quick take on post-placing trading Looking at the trading since the placing shares came on, there have clearly been some large sells (100k\u2013400k blocks) around 2.4\u20132.6p, which is normal placing stock being recycled. What matters is that these sells are being met by steady buying at the same levels and higher. Despite visible supply and intraday spread widening, 2.5p is acting as a defended level, with buyers stepping into supply rather than waiting lower. If this was uncontrolled placing overhang, the price would already be below the placing price. Instead, demand is absorbing supply. Net effect: placing pressure looks to be easing, not increasing. On current volumes, the bulk of the overhang should clear over the next couple of months, potentially sooner if drilling / JORC momentum picks up. (The next set of assay results are expected in early February.) Once this phase ends, the share price should start reacting properly to news again.",

          "content": "Worth separating what is confirmed by RNS from what is inferred. Prior to the Shard-led raise, CMRS did not have balance sheet capacity to pursue acquisitions and aggressively drill Agadir Melloul. After the raise \u00a32.925m gross does allow selective bolt-on acquisitions. But not \u201clarge\u201d or transformational deals without further equity or JV structures. Morocco is genuinely rich in under-explored copper/gold assets. CMRS does have in-country expertise Mr Noureddine, but quality assets are not cheap unless distressed, and competition from majors/juniors is rising. Majors and mid-tiers are re-entering the country, looking for advanced, low-risk projects (eg CMRS after JORC) Juniors are trying to lock up ground early and competing for the best sediment-hosted systems. This does not mean majors are buying early-stage explorers left and right. It means Good assets get noticed faster once they cross certain technical thresholds. JORC is the first of those thresholds, not the last, which is where CMRS is aiming to be by mid\u2013late 2026. CMRS would be more JV-friendly than outright M&A at this stage Majors and credible mid-tiers care about five things, in roughly this order: 1.\tScale (tonnage potential, not just grade) 2.\tMining simplicity (open pit, low strip) 3.\tCapex intensity (can it be built cheaply?) 4.\tJurisdiction (Morocco scores well) 5.\tStrategic fit (district control or mill feed) The investment case strengthens materially if CMRS ticks all five. Gillini has been a strategic supporter. Post-prospectus approval, insiders can participate. RNS confirms continued support of a strategic major shareholder, but that could be equity, loan, or structured. \u201c\u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini\u201d Is this supported by any RNS ? What is actually confirmed \u00a32.925m raised at 2.25p, not 3.45p. Warrants at 4.5p are potential future cash, not current. Serious interest does exist, but \u00a310m is not in the bank. CMRS is properly funded to reach JORC. Acquisition optionality now exists. Insider alignment is likely positive. Currently maybe don\u2019t price in a \u00a39-\u00a310 Million war chest or guaranteed Gillini funding beyond disclosed terms. However the market will value CMRS on JORC quality, not BB arithmetic.",

Looking at the raise as a whole, \u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini - nearly \u00a310m.

Drilling during H1 is designed to produce Agadir Melloul\u2019s maiden resource estimate, targeted for publication in early Q3 2026.\nKey Highlights\nAccelerated drill programme at Agadir-Melloul\nTwo diamond rigs ramping-up to two shifts per day each\n20 holes planned per month from mid-February\nAgadir Melloul\u2019s maiden resource estimate targeted for Q3 2026\nFig.1 Company\u2019s diamond rig at Agadir Melloul\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cWith two rigs now turning, we anticipate an extremely productive drill programme and for an internal maiden resource to be modelled by late Q2 and for the JORC compliant resource estimate to be published in early Q3.\nDrilling has been intermittent in recent weeks due to inclement weather. This week both rigs are operating on day shifts, and once the weather improves night shifts will be introduced. From then on we should be drilling 20 holes per month equating to approximately 1,000m.\nFor a near-surface project like this, metres drilled is less important than the number of holes drilled. Each hole will range from 20m to 50m depth, with the occasional deeper hole to drill-test the basement as we continue the hunt for mineralised rhyolite.\nIt\u2019s worth reiterating that near-surface mineralisation is quite unusual and a huge economic advantage in terms of opex, upfront capex, reserve development capex and ongoing sustaining capex\u201d.\nENDS\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\nChief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nShard Capital LLP\nErik Woolgar\nDamon Heath\nAlbR Capital\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 207 186 9952\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce critical minerals for the global economy, including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

          "content": "Quick take on post-placing trading Looking at the trading since the placing shares came on, there have clearly been some large sells (100k\u2013400k blocks) around 2.4\u20132.6p, which is normal placing stock being recycled. What matters is that these sells are being met by steady buying at the same levels and higher. Despite visible supply and intraday spread widening, 2.5p is acting as a defended level, with buyers stepping into supply rather than waiting lower. If this was uncontrolled placing overhang, the price would already be below the placing price. Instead, demand is absorbing supply. Net effect: placing pressure looks to be easing, not increasing. On current volumes, the bulk of the overhang should clear over the next couple of months, potentially sooner if drilling / JORC momentum picks up. (The next set of assay results are expected in early February.) Once this phase ends, the share price should start reacting properly to news again.",

          "content": "Worth separating what is confirmed by RNS from what is inferred. Prior to the Shard-led raise, CMRS did not have balance sheet capacity to pursue acquisitions and aggressively drill Agadir Melloul. After the raise \u00a32.925m gross does allow selective bolt-on acquisitions. But not \u201clarge\u201d or transformational deals without further equity or JV structures. Morocco is genuinely rich in under-explored copper/gold assets. CMRS does have in-country expertise Mr Noureddine, but quality assets are not cheap unless distressed, and competition from majors/juniors is rising. Majors and mid-tiers are re-entering the country, looking for advanced, low-risk projects (eg CMRS after JORC) Juniors are trying to lock up ground early and competing for the best sediment-hosted systems. This does not mean majors are buying early-stage explorers left and right. It means Good assets get noticed faster once they cross certain technical thresholds. JORC is the first of those thresholds, not the last, which is where CMRS is aiming to be by mid\u2013late 2026. CMRS would be more JV-friendly than outright M&A at this stage Majors and credible mid-tiers care about five things, in roughly this order: 1.\tScale (tonnage potential, not just grade) 2.\tMining simplicity (open pit, low strip) 3.\tCapex intensity (can it be built cheaply?) 4.\tJurisdiction (Morocco scores well) 5.\tStrategic fit (district control or mill feed) The investment case strengthens materially if CMRS ticks all five. Gillini has been a strategic supporter. Post-prospectus approval, insiders can participate. RNS confirms continued support of a strategic major shareholder, but that could be equity, loan, or structured. \u201c\u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini\u201d Is this supported by any RNS ? What is actually confirmed \u00a32.925m raised at 2.25p, not 3.45p. Warrants at 4.5p are potential future cash, not current. Serious interest does exist, but \u00a310m is not in the bank. CMRS is properly funded to reach JORC. Acquisition optionality now exists. Insider alignment is likely positive. Currently maybe don\u2019t price in a \u00a39-\u00a310 Million war chest or guaranteed Gillini funding beyond disclosed terms. However the market will value CMRS on JORC quality, not BB arithmetic.",

What matters is that these sells are being met by steady buying at the same levels and higher. Despite visible supply and intraday spread widening, 2.5p is acting as a defended level, with buyers stepping into supply rather than waiting lower. If this was uncontrolled placing overhang, the price would already be below the placing price. Instead, demand is absorbing supply. Net effect: placing pressure looks to be easing, not increasing. On current volumes, the bulk of the overhang should clear over the next couple of months, potentially sooner if drilling / JORC momentum picks up. (The next set of assay results are expected in early February.) Once this phase ends, the share price should start reacting properly to news again.",

          "content": "Worth separating what is confirmed by RNS from what is inferred. Prior to the Shard-led raise, CMRS did not have balance sheet capacity to pursue acquisitions and aggressively drill Agadir Melloul. After the raise \u00a32.925m gross does allow selective bolt-on acquisitions. But not \u201clarge\u201d or transformational deals without further equity or JV structures. Morocco is genuinely rich in under-explored copper/gold assets. CMRS does have in-country expertise Mr Noureddine, but quality assets are not cheap unless distressed, and competition from majors/juniors is rising. Majors and mid-tiers are re-entering the country, looking for advanced, low-risk projects (eg CMRS after JORC) Juniors are trying to lock up ground early and competing for the best sediment-hosted systems. This does not mean majors are buying early-stage explorers left and right. It means Good assets get noticed faster once they cross certain technical thresholds. JORC is the first of those thresholds, not the last, which is where CMRS is aiming to be by mid\u2013late 2026. CMRS would be more JV-friendly than outright M&A at this stage Majors and credible mid-tiers care about five things, in roughly this order: 1.\tScale (tonnage potential, not just grade) 2.\tMining simplicity (open pit, low strip) 3.\tCapex intensity (can it be built cheaply?) 4.\tJurisdiction (Morocco scores well) 5.\tStrategic fit (district control or mill feed) The investment case strengthens materially if CMRS ticks all five. Gillini has been a strategic supporter. Post-prospectus approval, insiders can participate. RNS confirms continued support of a strategic major shareholder, but that could be equity, loan, or structured. \u201c\u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini\u201d Is this supported by any RNS ? What is actually confirmed \u00a32.925m raised at 2.25p, not 3.45p. Warrants at 4.5p are potential future cash, not current. Serious interest does exist, but \u00a310m is not in the bank. CMRS is properly funded to reach JORC. Acquisition optionality now exists. Insider alignment is likely positive. Currently maybe don\u2019t price in a \u00a39-\u00a310 Million war chest or guaranteed Gillini funding beyond disclosed terms. However the market will value CMRS on JORC quality, not BB arithmetic.",

What matters is that these sells are being met by steady buying at the same levels and higher. Despite visible supply and intraday spread widening, 2.5p is acting as a defended level, with buyers stepping into supply rather than waiting lower. If this was uncontrolled placing overhang, the price would already be below the placing price. Instead, demand is absorbing supply. Net effect: placing pressure looks to be easing, not increasing. On current volumes, the bulk of the overhang should clear over the next couple of months, potentially sooner if drilling / JORC momentum picks up. (The next set of assay results are expected in early February.) Once this phase ends, the share price should start reacting properly to news again.",

          "content": "Worth separating what is confirmed by RNS from what is inferred. Prior to the Shard-led raise, CMRS did not have balance sheet capacity to pursue acquisitions and aggressively drill Agadir Melloul. After the raise \u00a32.925m gross does allow selective bolt-on acquisitions. But not \u201clarge\u201d or transformational deals without further equity or JV structures. Morocco is genuinely rich in under-explored copper/gold assets. CMRS does have in-country expertise Mr Noureddine, but quality assets are not cheap unless distressed, and competition from majors/juniors is rising. Majors and mid-tiers are re-entering the country, looking for advanced, low-risk projects (eg CMRS after JORC) Juniors are trying to lock up ground early and competing for the best sediment-hosted systems. This does not mean majors are buying early-stage explorers left and right. It means Good assets get noticed faster once they cross certain technical thresholds. JORC is the first of those thresholds, not the last, which is where CMRS is aiming to be by mid\u2013late 2026. CMRS would be more JV-friendly than outright M&A at this stage Majors and credible mid-tiers care about five things, in roughly this order: 1.\tScale (tonnage potential, not just grade) 2.\tMining simplicity (open pit, low strip) 3.\tCapex intensity (can it be built cheaply?) 4.\tJurisdiction (Morocco scores well) 5.\tStrategic fit (district control or mill feed) The investment case strengthens materially if CMRS ticks all five. Gillini has been a strategic supporter. Post-prospectus approval, insiders can participate. RNS confirms continued support of a strategic major shareholder, but that could be equity, loan, or structured. \u201c\u00a39m at 3.45 is likely plus \u00a30.725m due this quarter from Gillini\u201d Is this supported by any RNS ? What is actually confirmed \u00a32.925m raised at 2.25p, not 3.45p. Warrants at 4.5p are potential future cash, not current. Serious interest does exist, but \u00a310m is not in the bank. CMRS is properly funded to reach JORC. Acquisition optionality now exists. Insider alignment is likely positive. Currently maybe don\u2019t price in a \u00a39-\u00a310 Million war chest or guaranteed Gillini funding beyond disclosed terms. However the market will value CMRS on JORC quality, not BB arithmetic.",
