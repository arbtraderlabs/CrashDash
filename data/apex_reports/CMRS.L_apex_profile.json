Morrocco continues to stand out as highly capable mining jurisdiction, not only for its regulatory environment but the depth of practical expertise available on the ground.\nThat expertise will be increasingly important through 2026, as we progress Agadir Melloul towards production, supported by Moroccan experts with direct experience of developing and building multiple mines, including copper floatation operations\u201d\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman.

Our drilling continues to define shallow copper mineralisation, and we now have the extremely exciting addition of a gold discovery, also in a shallow setting.\nIn the latest results, we intercepted another 10m of nicely mineralised rhyolite, adding further support for more than one mineralised system and expanding the opportunity beyond the initial model.\nThere are also two copper-silver mineralised quartz veins within the project which will be mapped and drilled in due course. These are expected to add higher grade tonnage to the resource for blending with lower grade material.\nSo our targets now include sedimentary copper in carbonates, copper mineralised rhyolite, a gold system, and the copper vein structures we have not yet drilled.\nOur strong belief is that, over time, drilling will delineate multiple zones of potentially economic shallow copper mineralisation, within broader envelopes of lower grade material. In our view, it is only a matter of time and drill metres before we define sufficient resources to push the button on construction of a starter operation, what we\u2019ve named the Initial Mine. We expect that decision to be made in early 2027\u201d\nOutlook\nCMR remains firmly on track to deliver a shallow, open pittable, maiden resource by late Q2 to early Q3 2026, sufficient in scale to underpin the Initial Mine development. CMR\u2019s longer term Initial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper is based on a shallow, semi-continuous tabular resource with a 2.0m average thickness and an average grade of 1.2% copper equivalent.\nFollowing publication of the resource estimate in H1 2026, CMR will immediately commence the Agadir-Melloul feasibility study and Environmental Impact Assessment for the processing plant, targeting construction of the Initial Mine during 2027. With the Company\u2019s own, new rig now operational, we expect drilling to be maintained at a steady rate with fewer breakdowns.\nThe project is emerging as one of the most compelling new copper discoveries, combining shallow geometry, good grades, attractive scale potential, and multi system upside, a combination rarely seen at this early stage of exploration.\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman.
