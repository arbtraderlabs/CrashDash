Drilling during H1 is designed to produce Agadir Melloul\u2019s maiden resource estimate, targeted for publication in early Q3 2026.\nKey Highlights\nAccelerated drill programme at Agadir-Melloul\nTwo diamond rigs ramping-up to two shifts per day each\n20 holes planned per month from mid-February\nAgadir Melloul\u2019s maiden resource estimate targeted for Q3 2026\nFig.1 Company\u2019s diamond rig at Agadir Melloul\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cWith two rigs now turning, we anticipate an extremely productive drill programme and for an internal maiden resource to be modelled by late Q2 and for the JORC compliant resource estimate to be published in early Q3.\nDrilling has been intermittent in recent weeks due to inclement weather. This week both rigs are operating on day shifts, and once the weather improves night shifts will be introduced. From then on we should be drilling 20 holes per month equating to approximately 1,000m.\nFor a near-surface project like this, metres drilled is less important than the number of holes drilled. Each hole will range from 20m to 50m depth, with the occasional deeper hole to drill-test the basement as we continue the hunt for mineralised rhyolite.\nIt\u2019s worth reiterating that near-surface mineralisation is quite unusual and a huge economic advantage in terms of opex, upfront capex, reserve development capex and ongoing sustaining capex\u201d.\nENDS\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\nChief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nShard Capital LLP\nErik Woolgar\nDamon Heath\nAlbR Capital\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 207 186 9952\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce critical minerals for the global economy, including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution. Many of these commodities are widely recognised as being at the start of a supply and demand super cycle.\nCMR is building a diversified portfolio of high-quality metals exploration and development projects in Morocco, focusing on copper, silver and potentially other critical minerals and metals. CMR identified Morocco as an ideal mining-friendly jurisdiction that meets its acquisition and operational criteria. The country is perfectly located to supply raw materials to Europe and possesses excellent prospective geology, good infrastructure and attractive permitting, tax and royalty conditions.\nThe Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange (CMRS.L).

Prospecting by CMR's geological team demonstrates copper and silver in multiple quartz vein and shear zone structures with some zones assaying for gold.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is also in discussions with a leading global commodity trading group that would like CMR to act as its Moroccan partner to source and supply certain minerals for its global supply chain. Trading in metals and potentially industrial minerals, either in a partnership or individually, provides the Company with an opportunity for near-term cash flows.\n\u00b7\nIfri Project located in an alteration hotspot and initial channel sampling included an assay of 3.1% copper and 17 g/t silver.\n\u00b7\nThe Ifri Project is in an active mining belt which hosts four active and seven previously operating mines of copper, silver and gold.\nBackground to the Placing and use of proceeds\nOn 16 January 2024, the Company announced it had acquired 26 exploration permits\nin central Morocco\nprospective for copper, antimony, tungsten, lead-zinc and gold via the acquisition of\nHesperis Resources SARL, a Moroccan company. The acquisition transforms the Morrocan footprint of CMR's incubator portfolio and its exposure to a wider range of critical metals and minerals. It also cements CMR's position as one of the region's leading developers of critical minerals.\nIfri Project mineralisation\nCMR remains focused on developing Morrocan clean energy and critical minerals projects that offer significant scale potential. Accordingly, and following in-depth analysis, the Company has concluded the Ifri Project meets these criteria. Initial prospecting at the Ifri site located multiple large copper mineralised shear structures with copper oxide, copper sulphide, silver and gold mineralisation.\nNet proceeds from the Placing will enable a complete mapping and geochemical survey of the project area. Ifri benefits from established local road and power infrastructure.\nMorocco operations\nIn the last 9 months, the Company has gained significant momentum in Morroco. It now has a considerable geological understanding of the region's potential as a global commodities hub. Furthermore, it has extensive relationships within the mining sector at a domestic level. This regional Intellectual Property and know-how has led to the Company receiving interest from a leading global commodity trading group to become its Morrocan partner and supply it with commodities from the region\n. CMR is now in discussions to formalise the partnership.\nPDMR Dealing & KM Securities Pty Ltd\nKM Securities Pty Ltd\u00a0('KM Securities'), in which\u00a0Russell Thomson, a Non-Executive Director of the Company is a 50% shareholder, acquired 2,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company as part of this Placing.\nCharlie Long, Chief Executive Officer of CMR PLC, commented:\n\"I would like to thank our existing shareholders for their support and welcome new shareholders to the register. The net proceeds from the Fundraising will accelerate the significant Morrocan opportunities CMR has successfully created and advanced in recent months. As a specialist Morrocan exploration and development company, we remain focused on developing projects and opportunities that offer the prospect for meaningful production of critical commodities and near-term cash generation. We are delighted with our recent progress and are confident the fundraise will further enhance our Morrocan momentum.\"\nCritical Mineral Resources plc\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nHudson Sandler (Financial PR)\nCharlie Jack\n+44 (0) 207 796 4133\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) plc is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities essential for renewable energy, battery storage and electrification to support the clean energy revolution.
