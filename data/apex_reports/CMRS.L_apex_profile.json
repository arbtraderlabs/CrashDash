The rig has now moved to the next pad where drilling has already commenced. The next set of assay results are expected in early February.\nThe rig\u2019s commissioning was completed efficiently and included the integration of a Moroccan-sourced water recycling system.\nKey Highlights\nFirst core has been recovered at Zone 1 North from the Company\u2019s recently commissioned diamond rig\nVisible copper mineralisation observed in the core, consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations and many of the previous holes\nCompany-owned drill rig expected to underpin lower drilling costs and improved drilling flexibility\nThe drilling team has provided very positive feedback about the Multi-Power Discovery HD rig\nRig\u2019s capability provides optionality to test deeper targets, including the potential source of mineralised rhyolite\nStrong, experienced Morocco-based team positioned to support an accelerated programme through 2026\nFig.1 First drill core from recently commissioned diamond drilling rig with observable copper mineralisation\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cThe commissioning of our company owned drill rig is a genuine step-forward for the project.\nHaving this capability in-house gives us far greater control over the drill programme and paves the way for reduced drilling costs.\nOur drilling team is reporting that the Multi-Power Discovery HD is powerful, productive and straightforward to operate, making rapid progress through carbonate and igneous rocks. Importantly it also provides us with the capability to explore deeper targets as required, including as we continue hunting for the source of the mineralised rhyolite.\nCredit goes to our Moroccan drilling team, expertly led by our COO Noureddine, and our dedicated JV partner, who commissioned the rig smoothly and installed a locally sourced water recycling system without issue. Morrocco continues to stand out as highly capable mining jurisdiction, not only for its regulatory environment but the depth of practical expertise available on the ground.\nThat expertise will be increasingly important through 2026, as we progress Agadir Melloul towards production, supported by Moroccan experts with direct experience of developing and building multiple mines, including copper floatation operations\u201d\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman.

Our drilling continues to define shallow copper mineralisation, and we now have the extremely exciting addition of a gold discovery, also in a shallow setting.\nIn the latest results, we intercepted another 10m of nicely mineralised rhyolite, adding further support for more than one mineralised system and expanding the opportunity beyond the initial model.\nThere are also two copper-silver mineralised quartz veins within the project which will be mapped and drilled in due course. These are expected to add higher grade tonnage to the resource for blending with lower grade material.\nSo our targets now include sedimentary copper in carbonates, copper mineralised rhyolite, a gold system, and the copper vein structures we have not yet drilled.\nOur strong belief is that, over time, drilling will delineate multiple zones of potentially economic shallow copper mineralisation, within broader envelopes of lower grade material. In our view, it is only a matter of time and drill metres before we define sufficient resources to push the button on construction of a starter operation, what we\u2019ve named the Initial Mine. We expect that decision to be made in early 2027\u201d\nOutlook\nCMR remains firmly on track to deliver a shallow, open pittable, maiden resource by late Q2 to early Q3 2026, sufficient in scale to underpin the Initial Mine development. CMR\u2019s longer term Initial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper is based on a shallow, semi-continuous tabular resource with a 2.0m average thickness and an average grade of 1.2% copper equivalent.\nFollowing publication of the resource estimate in H1 2026, CMR will immediately commence the Agadir-Melloul feasibility study and Environmental Impact Assessment for the processing plant, targeting construction of the Initial Mine during 2027. With the Company\u2019s own, new rig now operational, we expect drilling to be maintained at a steady rate with fewer breakdowns.\nThe project is emerging as one of the most compelling new copper discoveries, combining shallow geometry, good grades, attractive scale potential, and multi system upside, a combination rarely seen at this early stage of exploration.\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman.

The team is now focused on commissioning the rig as quickly as possible, with the first bore hole expected to be drilled during the first half of December.\nHighlights\nThe Company\u2019s fully refurbished Discovery HD track-mounted diamond core drill has arrived at Agadir Melloul.\nSome important features:\nFitted with brand new Caterpillar\n308E steel tracks for rapid moves between drill pads\nCompact, robust design with a heavy-duty telescopic mast and powerful hoisting winch capable of pulling the complete drill string from the ground and pulling in 20 ft sections\nDrilling depth capacity of 1400m NQ (47.6mm core), 876m HQ (63.5mm core)\nDelivered with new consumable parts such as jaws, bushings and comprehensive remote site spares kit to minimise risk of downtime\nThe rig is expected to be operational during the first half of December, almost immediately doubling our drilling capacity.\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cIt has been quite a journey for our Discovery HD rig and its arrival represents an important milestone for the project. The rig has undergone a comprehensive refurbishment and is effectively as good as new.\nWith proper care, we expect it to deliver consistent performance for the next decade and provide significant per metre cost savings.\nMulti Power, the manufacturer, was extremely supportive, generously installing a brand new feed cylinder, instead of resealing the original, replacing key components including foot clamp, and completely stripping and professionally repainting the mast. New Cat 308E tracks were also sourced and installed to ensure maximum efficiency.\nThe additional refurbishment and some shipping complications meant the rig arrived later than originally planned. It is a testament to our team on the ground, and the advantages of operating in Morocco, that once we knew of the delay, we were quickly able to secure the services of a trusted drilling contractor who began work immediately, ensuring that progress continued uninterrupted.\nWe are now carefully unpacking and inspecting all components, and with our newly appointed drill operator already in place, the team is ready to commission and bring the rig into operation without delay. The arrival of our rig puts us in an excellent position to significantly accelerate drilling and to advance on all fronts, simultaneously drilling both the sedimentary copper deposit and the exciting new Rhyolite discovery.\nWe look forward to seeing the Discovery HD drill its first holes in the first half of December\u201d.\nFig.1\nDiscovery HD track-mounted diamond drill at Agadir Melloul\nSource: Company\nENDS\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\nChief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nAlbR Capital\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce critical minerals for the global economy, including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.

Ongoing mapping confirms a district wide mineralised envelope, consistent with our 25 million tonne Initial Exploration Target.\nShallow, near surface tabular copper deposit supports low capex and rapid development pathway, with a geometry amenable to open-pit operations.\nThe new Rhyolite Target copper-silver discovery adds a second, potentially large scale, mineral system, materially expanding the projects already significant upside potential.\nOn track to break ground on the Initial Mine Development in 2027, with a maiden resource expected as early as H1 2026.\nDrill results\nSediment hosted mineralisation:\nBH01 - 5.8m at 1.12% copper and 19g/t silver from 2.2m\nBH04 - 2.5m at 0.85% copper and 4g/t silver from 1.5m\nBH06 - 2.0m at 1.3% copper from 16m\nBH07 - 1.3m at 0.98% copper from 16.7m\nBH09 - 3.0m at 0.75% copper from 10m\nBH12 - 4.0m at 1.04% copper from 2.0m\nBH 35 - 7.5m at 0.97% copper inc. 6.5m at 1.03% copper\nBH 36 - 4.7m at 1.48% copper from 17m\nBH 38 - 4.7m at 1.03% copper from 27m\nBH 43 - 3.0m at 1.1% copper from 6.0m\nBH 45 - 1.60m at 1.1% copper from 6.0m, 4.0m at 0.77% copper and 2.0m at 1.05% copper from 16.4m\nAlso, the new Rhyolite Target copper-silver discovery confirmed in late October, with the first drill hole returning very encouraging results:\nBHR01 - 6.0m at 1.4% copper and 31g/t silver from surface\nFig.1 Zone 1 North, long section showing shallow undulating mineralisation\nSource: Company\nFig.2\nZone 1 North cross section\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cThese excellent results have surpassed our expectations. We are seeing broad zones of consistent, high quality copper mineralisation in a very shallow setting, with multiple intercepts over 4m. This is a brilliant outcome, and the Initial Mine and Strategic Resource strategies are both on track.\nIt is particularly exciting that we have drilled less than 1% of our 50km\n2\nsedimentary target, and geological evidence points to a large, mineralised copper system that extends across the project area. This positions the project as a scalable, district level opportunity, and we expect continued drilling to deliver a steady flow of excellent assay results as we build towards an extensive resource.\nAgadir Melloul is different from most copper development stories in the market.\nIt combines true scale potential, shallow geometry with near surface setting, creating economically and operationally favourable mining conditions in an excellent jurisdiction. This gives us a pathway to delivering a fast tracked, near surface operation.\nAnd now we also have the unexpected bonus of a rhyolite hosted mineralisation target. This is an exciting discovery, which our team believes represents a second standalone mineral system with strong copper and silver grades. If our working model holds, this could transform Agadir Melloul into a multi-deposit copper district, dramatically enhancing its long-term strategic value.\nOur shareholders have been patient, and we are now entering a period where we believe that patience will be rewarded. We are planning to accelerate our drilling program with an additional rig, to drill multiple targets, and ultimately add equity value from different parts of the project. The momentum is gathering, and we can look forward to much more good news in the future.\u201d\nSedimentary copper - depth, grade and thickness\nCMR\u2019s Initial Exploration Target of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of contained copper is based on a shallow, semi-continuous tabular resource with a 2.0m average thickness and an average grade of 1.2% copper equivalent. While we are retaining the 2.0m target for now, today\u2019s assay results indicate clear potential for the average thickness to exceed our current assumptions, proving tangible resource growth potential as drilling progresses.\nThe\ngeometry\nof our exploration target is comparable to several well-known sediment hosted copper orebodies in the Zechstein Basin, such as KGHM\u2019s Lubin Mine in Poland, which has an average thickness of 2.8m (ranging from 1.5m to 5.0m) and an average reserve grade of 0.95% copper and 48g/t silver.\nLubin operates at depths of 368m to more than 1,000m\n.\nIts longevity and scale is supported by the exceptional consistency of the Kupferschiefer orebody.\nAgadir Melloul has similar geometry to Lubin but benefits enormously from very shallow, near surface mineralisation. Shallow mines typically benefit from lower capital intensity, lower sustaining and reserve development costs, and favourable mining economics, all of which support a fast-track development profile.\nStrategic Resource Strategy\nConcurrently with the Initial Mine development, CMR is moving aggressively to advance its parallel strategy of delineating a large-scale strategic resource at Agadir-Melloul. With our own, new core drill rig arriving imminently, drilling will accelerate sharply, enabling rapid expansion of the known mineralised footprint.\nOur primary target is a laterally semi-continuous 1.5m to 3.5m thick extensive zone of mineralised sediments, comprising limestones, dolomites and microconglomerates. Mineralisation within this sequence demonstrates strong lateral continuity, with higher grade zones developing where host rocks exhibit elevated permeability and porosity, a model that supports the potential for a large-scale discovery.\nSummary and rhyolite assessment\nCMR remains firmly on track to deliver a shallow, open pittable, maiden resource by late Q2 to early Q3 2026, sufficient in scale to underpin the Initial Mine development.\nThe initial resource\u2019s grade and geometry is expected to be in line with our target of a near surface, 2.0m thick and 1.2% copper equivalent deposit, with potential for thickness to increase based on current intercepts.\nThe Rhyolite Target discovery has created a major new growth vector. There are various scenarios, all of which are very positive. The base case is that drilling delineates a near surface rhyolite hosted mineralisation through secondary enrichment. Even this would represent a highly valuable addition to the project.\nHowever, our working hypothesis, is that the rhyolite was mineralised with primary copper and silver, which would constitute an entirely new igneous hosted copper system within the project. This scenario would significantly elevate Agadir Melloul\u2019s long term and large-scale potential.\nCMR will shortly be selecting representative core samples from both styles of mineralisation for thin-section and associated detailed petrology and mineralogy studies.\nFig.3\nCurrent portfolio map\nSource: Company\nFig.4\nDrilled area in dark grey represents <1% of project\u2019s 50km\n2\ntarget limestone\nSource: Company\nFig.5\nGeological model showing mineralised envelope and targeted higher-grade zones\nSource: Company\nFig.6\nRhyolite Target core\nSource: Company\nOutlook\nFollowing publication of the resource estimate in H1 2026, CMR will immediately commence the Agadir-Melloul feasibility study and Environmental Impact Assessment for the processing plant, as it targets construction of the Initial Mine during 2027. With the Company\u2019s own, new rig arriving imminently to accelerate exploration, we expect drilling density, mineralised footprint, and resource to grow rapidly.\nThe project is emerging as one of the most compelling new copper discoveries, with size, grade, geometry, and multi system upside rarely seen at this early stage of exploration.\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman.
