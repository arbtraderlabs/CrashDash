Increasing our ownership, strengthening leadership at the asset level and commencing hot commissioning of Kiln 2 demonstrate our clear focus on scaling our flagship operation. With Yuval now focused entirely on leading Limeco on the ground, we are well positioned to optimise output, enhance operational performance and unlock meaningful shareholder value. I would like to thank Yuval for his significant time, commitment and contribution to the Board, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him as he drives Limeco forward.\"\nDETAILS\nOperations Update\nLimeco has commenced hot commissioning of Kiln 2 anticipated to take 10-14 days. Once commissioning is complete, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximately three-month optimisation period. This represents an important milestone in increasing Limeco's production capacity and advancing the business toward steady-state production. Further updates will be provided as commissioning of Kiln 2 progresses and the optimisation phase advances.\nLimeco Option\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has notified the relevant parties of its intention to exercise the next tranche of the Option, which will increase its shareholding from 30.7 percent to 36.2 percent. The cash consideration to be paid amounts to US$981,667. This decision reflects the Board's continued confidence in Limeco as production ramps up.\nLimeco\nIn its most recent published accounts (financial year ended 31 December 2024), Limeco posted a loss before tax of ZMW 222,443,499 (US$8,496,696\u2020) on turnover of ZMW 26,296,833 (US$1,004,463\u2020). As at 31 December 2024, Limeco had net liabilities of ZMW 2,867,291,084 (US$102,844,013\u2021). Liabilities included ZMW 2,914,751,858 (US$104,546,336\u2021) due to shareholders (\"Shareholders Loan\"). Following the exercise of the third tranche of the Option, Firering increases its right to 36.2% (cUS$28.1m\u2021) of the Shareholders Loan.\nNotes\n* the Option was described as the \"New Option\" in the Company's notification of 28 May 2024 which sets out detail of the Share Purchase Agreement and Option arrangements\n\u2020 at the exchange rate of Zambian Kwacha (ZMW) 26.18 : $1\n\u2021 at the exchange rate of ZMW 27.88 : $1\nDirectorship Change\nAs Limeco continues to represent the Company's primary value driver, Mr Yuval Cohen has stepped down with immediate effect from his roles as CEO and Director of Firering to focus exclusively on his position as CEO of Limeco. Yuval has been closely involved in Limeco's development to date, and his full-time focus is expected to strengthen operational execution and accelerate the business's commercial progress. Youval Rasin, Firering's Chairman, has been appointed as Interim CEO of Firering whilst a permanent replacement in sought.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

The final container with equipment for Kilns 3 and 4 is now on site, allowing the Company to move quickly into modifying these kilns once Kiln 2 is optimised and operating.\nKiln 1 remains operational, and over recent months Limeco has built up an inventory of approximately 5,000 tonnes of finished product, providing near-term supply flexibility as production scales.\nIn addition, Limeco is fast-tracking the installation of a high-purity calcium carbonate milling circuit (exceeding 95 percent CaCO\u2083). This will create a new revenue stream with applications across construction materials, industrial products and environmental uses. Commissioning of the milling circuit is currently expected in Q3 2026.\nLimeco Sales and Customer Engagement\nCommercial momentum continues to build, with a growing pipeline of sales discussions progressing through the typical three-month qualification process, including laboratory testing, bulk sampling, site inspections and trial orders.\nNotably, Limeco recently hosted a site visit from a major international mining group operating in Zambia, the country's largest copper and cobalt producer. Discussions focused on Limeco's production capabilities and the potential supply of hydrated lime, reflecting increasing demand from large-scale mining operators for reliable, high-performance lime products critical to their operations.\nAtex and Alliance Portfolio Assets\nFollowing the announcement of 19 August 2025 and subsequent confirmation of full and final settlement (as detailed in the announcements of 12 November 2025, 19 November 2025 and 24 December 2025), Firering now holds a 90 percent interest in Atex and a 51 percent interest in Alliance, both lithium-tantalum projects located in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. These assets are fully unencumbered.\nThe Board continues to monitor improving lithium market conditions, which it believes are increasingly highlighting the compelling value fundamentals of both projects. In this context, Firering has received third-party interest in Atex and Alliance, reinforcing their underlying value within the Company's portfolio.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

ON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc / EPIC: FRG / Market: AIM / Sector: Mining\n24 December 2025\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc\n(\"Firering\" or \"the Company\")\nFundraising and Limeco Operations Update; Related Party Transactions\nFunded and Scaling Production\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG), a producer of lime products and explorer of critical minerals, is pleased to announce that it has received US$1m in full and final settlement of all debts and claims owed by Ricca. In addition, Firering announces the closing of a placing and subscription raising a further \u00a30.86 m (the \"Placing\" and \"Subscription\"). The injection of new capital will support continued progress at Firering's flagship asset, Limeco Resources Limited (\"Limeco\") in Zambia, where the ramp up of lime production is advancing in line with the Company's growth strategy.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nUS$1m Ricca debt settlement received together with \u00a30.86m raised, support increasing Firering's interest in Limeco and the continued ramp up of operations\n\u00b7\nKiln 2 refurbishment complete with current activities focussed on connecting it to the gasifier and feed system - cold commissioning to commence in mid-January.\n\u00b7\nFinal container for Kiln 3 & 4 expected on site next month allowing for the immediate refurbishment and commissioning of these two additional kilns after bringing Kiln 2 online.\n\u00b7\nThird product stream, a >95% CaCo3 powder, which is expected to achieve multiples of the sales value of the limestone in its current aggregate form, now being developed.\n\u00b7\nCommercial traction accelerating under new Head of Sales, with several long-term partner negotiations advancing through a three to six month testing cycle.\nYuval Cohen, Chief Executive\nOfficer of Firering, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have received the US$1m Ricca settlement along with completing the Placing and Subscription for an additional \u00a30.86 m, largely supported by existing shareholders. The injection of new capital comes at a pivotal stage for Firering as we look to increase our interest in Limeco, our primary value driver, as we push forward with operational ramp up and product diversification efforts.\n\"Operational progress at Limeco continues to build, reflecting our focus on establishing an efficient and growth-oriented lime products business. With Kiln 1 performing reliably and Kiln 2 due for cold commissioning in the coming weeks, we are on track to increase output, producing both quicklime and hydrated lime. This momentum is further supported by third party interest in acquiring limestone powder produced directly from Limeco's Tier 1 limestone resource. These developments position Limeco as a responsible, long-term supplier of lime products to the mining, food, and industrial sectors.\"\nDETAILS\nRicca Resources US$1M Settlement\nFurther to updates announced on the 19 November 2025 and 12 December 2025, all the Share Purchase Agreement completion conditions have been satisfied and Skylark has transferred US$1m to settle all outstanding amounts due from Ricca.\nFirering expects Ricca will make a distribution of net proceeds to Ricca shareholders following completion of the sale of a subsidiary asset for A$4.4m (approximately \u00a32.2 million), subject to an adjustment of up to A$332,000 (approximately \u00a3166,000) payable to Skylark Minerals Limited (ASX:SKM) (Skylark). Firering holds a 10.6% shareholding in Ricca.\nBackground to the Placing and Subscription\nFirering has raised additional funds via a Placing and Subscription principally to cover general working capital requirements, the property transfer tax charges in relation to the transfer of the shares it has already acquired in Limeco and to cover its share of any potential Limeco operating expenditures.\nPlacing\nThe Placing has been undertaken by the Company's broker Shard Capital Partners LLP ('Shard') and has raised, in aggregate, gross proceeds of \u00a30.585m through the placing of 46,800,000 new ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\") to certain investors at a price (\"Issue Price\") of 1.25 pence per share.\u00a0The Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 7 percent to the Closing Price of 1.35 pence per Ordinary Share on 23 December 2025, being the latest practicable business day prior to this announcement.\nThe Placing is conditional upon Admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM by 13 January 2026. The Company has agreed to pay Shard certain commission on the funds raised in addition to the grant of 2,808,000 warrants over Ordinary Shares (the 'Broker Warrants'). Each Broker Warrant will entitle Shard to subscribe for one new Ordinary Share at a price of 1.25 pence per Ordinary Share, exercisable for a period of three years from date of Admission.\nSubscription\nThe Company has raised \u00a30.275 million through the subscription whereby various investors have subscribed directly with the Company for 22,000,000 new Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price of 1.25 p per share.\nThe Subscription is conditional upon Admission of the Subscription Shares to trading on AIM by 8,00am on 13 January 2025.\nIn aggregate the Company has raised \u00a30.86 million gross (\u00a30.817 million net) in the Placing and Subscription.\nRelated Party Transactions\nClearglass Investments Limited (\"Clearglass\") has subscribed \u00a385,000 for 6,800,000 shares in the Subscription at the Issue Price. Clearglass is a Cypriot company (Company number HE351995), in which the Company's Chairman, Youval Rasin, is a director and 40% shareholder.\nThis subscription constitutes a related party transaction under AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nPremier Miton Group plc has subscribed \u00a3250,000 for 20,000,000 shares in the Placing at the Issue Price. This subscription constitutes a related party transaction under AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nThe Independent Directors (being Shai Kol, Yuval Cohen, Vassilios Carellas and Remy Welschinger) consider, having consulted with SPARK Advisory Partners Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the subscription by Clearglass and Premier Miton Group plc are fair and reasonable in so far as Shareholders are concerned.\nSubscribing Directors' Shareholdings\nName\nNumber of Subscription Shares\nTotal number of shares held post Admission\n% of enlarged share capital\nYouval Rasin*\n6,800,000\n33,004,795\n8.27\n* 13,466,666 of Mr Rasin's shareholding post Admission set out above are held by Clearglass Investments Limited, a company in which Mr Rasin is a director and shareholder.\nAdmission\nApplication will be made shortly to the London Stock Exchange plc for 68,800,000 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in these Shares on AIM will commence at 8:00 a.m. on or around 13 January 2026.\nTotal voting rights\nOn Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will consist of 399,154,292 Ordinary Shares, with one vote per share. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, on Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares and voting rights in the Company will be 399,154,292. With effect from Admission, this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nLimeco Operations Update\nIn line with its development strategy, the Limeco quicklime operation continues to advance with Kiln1 continuing to operate reliably. Refurbishment of Kiln 2 is complete and activities are now focussed on connecting this Kiln to the feed system and gasifier. The schedule slipped slightly after one container was held at the border for several weeks, but cold commissioning is now expected to be commence in mid-January.\nPlanning for Kilns 3 and 4 is also moving ahead, with key equipment already on site and the final container for these kilns expected to be on site next month. The Company will then be in a position to move forward with the refurbishment and commissioning soon after Kiln 2 has been brought online.\nLimeco has also expanded its product range with the introduction of hydrated lime product whose margins are higher than those of quicklime. The hydrated lime is currently manually produced and interest for this product has necessitated Limeco to investigate installing a larger automated hydrating system.\nIn addition to hydrated lime, there has been third party interest for Limeco to produce a limestone powder from its Tier 1 high quality JORC Code Compliant limestone deposit. Limeco has confirmed that the cement plant that is currently being stored in containers on site has all the necessary equipment to produce this product. Limeco is now putting plans in place to install the required milling circuit to produce the >95% CaCo3 powder which is expected to achieve multiples of the value when compared to what it is currently being sold for in its aggregate form.\nLimeco is accelerating its commercial momentum under its new Head of Sales, backed by a focused marketing refresh and deeper customer outreach. Discussions with multiple long-term industrial partners are progressing, moving through the structured three to six month engagement and testing cycle. Following laboratory testing of Limeco's products, larger trial orders for quicklime and hydrated lime have been shipped to Zimbabwe and to the Copperbelt to run through their respective processing circuits.\nFurther, Limeco has also commenced with a registration process to become a registered supplier of lime products to one of the largest copper producers in Zambia.\nAs lime products are a key reagent to both the gold and copper producing processes, Limeco is well positioned between the copper belt and gold fields of Zimbabwe to benefit from the resulting increase in production due to demand and higher commodity prices.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.
