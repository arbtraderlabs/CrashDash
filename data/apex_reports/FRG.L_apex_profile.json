Applying the learnings from Kiln 1 enables us to have a more predictable, repeatable ramp-up as we scale to a multi-kiln operation. Notably, each additional kiln brought into stable production, materially strengthens the business and expands its strategic optionality.\"\nDETAILS\nLimeco Operations\nLimeco has completed the hot commissioning of Kiln 2, during which saleable material was produced. As with the first kiln, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximate three-month optimisation period, during which operating parameters will be progressively refined to achieve consistent output with consistent quality and reliability. This optimisation phase is standard practice in the industry.\nKiln 2 incorporates the operational learnings from the ramp-up of Kiln 1, with targeted improvements to the burner system, airflow management, heat distribution and monitoring protocols, supporting a faster and more predictable path to steady-state production.\nEach additional kiln brought into stable operation materially strengthens operating leverage, cash generation potential and the overall resilience of the Project. In this context, the successful hot commissioning of Kiln 2 represents a further step in strengthening Firering's strategic and financing optionality as production capacity continues to increase.\nLimeco Sales and Customer Engagement\nCommercial momentum continues to build, with growing interest in Limeco's product range and encouraging developments across local and regional markets. Following a stringent validation process involving laboratory testing, bulk sampling, site inspections and trial orders, Limeco secured a 600t order from a major international mining group operating in Zambia. This order is currently being fulfilled, alongside a similar-sized order for material destined for clients in Zimbabwe. Engagements with additional prospective customers are ongoing, and Limeco is now well positioned to compete in tenders for longer-term supply contracts.\nLimeco Option Agreement\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (the \"Option\") (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has completed the exercise of the third tranche of the Option to acquire a further 5.5% interest in Limeco, taking its shareholding in Limeco to 36.2%.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an Africa-focused producer and developer of industrial and critical minerals. The Company's near-term focus is the ramp-up of production at the Limeco lime project in Zambia, where Firering holds a 36.2% interest with an option to increase this to 45%. Once fully optimised, Limeco is expected to be among the largest lime operations in the region, supplying major copper producers in the Central African Copperbelt and gold producers in Zimbabwe. Firering's portfolio also includes the highly prospective Atex Lithium-Tantalum Project in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

With Yuval now focused entirely on leading Limeco on the ground, we are well positioned to optimise output, enhance operational performance and unlock meaningful shareholder value. I would like to thank Yuval for his significant time, commitment and contribution to the Board, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him as he drives Limeco forward.\"\nDETAILS\nOperations Update\nLimeco has commenced hot commissioning of Kiln 2 anticipated to take 10-14 days. Once commissioning is complete, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximately three-month optimisation period. This represents an important milestone in increasing Limeco's production capacity and advancing the business toward steady-state production. Further updates will be provided as commissioning of Kiln 2 progresses and the optimisation phase advances.\nLimeco Option\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has notified the relevant parties of its intention to exercise the next tranche of the Option, which will increase its shareholding from 30.7 percent to 36.2 percent. The cash consideration to be paid amounts to US$981,667. This decision reflects the Board's continued confidence in Limeco as production ramps up.\nLimeco\nIn its most recent published accounts (financial year ended 31 December 2024), Limeco posted a loss before tax of ZMW 222,443,499 (US$8,496,696\u2020) on turnover of ZMW 26,296,833 (US$1,004,463\u2020). As at 31 December 2024, Limeco had net liabilities of ZMW 2,867,291,084 (US$102,844,013\u2021). Liabilities included ZMW 2,914,751,858 (US$104,546,336\u2021) due to shareholders (\"Shareholders Loan\"). Following the exercise of the third tranche of the Option, Firering increases its right to 36.2% (cUS$28.1m\u2021) of the Shareholders Loan.\nNotes\n* the Option was described as the \"New Option\" in the Company's notification of 28 May 2024 which sets out detail of the Share Purchase Agreement and Option arrangements\n\u2020 at the exchange rate of Zambian Kwacha (ZMW) 26.18 : $1\n\u2021 at the exchange rate of ZMW 27.88 : $1\nDirectorship Change\nAs Limeco continues to represent the Company's primary value driver, Mr Yuval Cohen has stepped down with immediate effect from his roles as CEO and Director of Firering to focus exclusively on his position as CEO of Limeco. Yuval has been closely involved in Limeco's development to date, and his full-time focus is expected to strengthen operational execution and accelerate the business's commercial progress. Youval Rasin, Firering's Chairman, has been appointed as Interim CEO of Firering whilst a permanent replacement in sought.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

At Limeco, the cold commissioning of our second kiln marks an important step towards scaling production, while growing customer engagement, and the acceleration of new potential revenue streams underline the strength of demand for our lime products. In parallel, improving lithium market dynamics are drawing renewed third-party interest in Atex and Alliance, highlighting the strategic value embedded in our wider portfolio.\"\nLimeco Operations\nLimeco continues to make good operational progress as it advances towards higher output from its integrated limestone mining and processing operation.\nFollowing on from connecting Kiln 2 to the feed system and gasifier, cold commissioning has commenced, with hot commissioning and optimisation to follow. Once commissioned, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp during a three month optimisation period. The final container with equipment for Kilns 3 and 4 is now on site, allowing the Company to move quickly into modifying these kilns once Kiln 2 is optimised and operating.\nKiln 1 remains operational, and over recent months Limeco has built up an inventory of approximately 5,000 tonnes of finished product, providing near-term supply flexibility as production scales.\nIn addition, Limeco is fast-tracking the installation of a high-purity calcium carbonate milling circuit (exceeding 95 percent CaCO\u2083). This will create a new revenue stream with applications across construction materials, industrial products and environmental uses. Commissioning of the milling circuit is currently expected in Q3 2026.\nLimeco Sales and Customer Engagement\nCommercial momentum continues to build, with a growing pipeline of sales discussions progressing through the typical three-month qualification process, including laboratory testing, bulk sampling, site inspections and trial orders.\nNotably, Limeco recently hosted a site visit from a major international mining group operating in Zambia, the country's largest copper and cobalt producer. Discussions focused on Limeco's production capabilities and the potential supply of hydrated lime, reflecting increasing demand from large-scale mining operators for reliable, high-performance lime products critical to their operations.\nAtex and Alliance Portfolio Assets\nFollowing the announcement of 19 August 2025 and subsequent confirmation of full and final settlement (as detailed in the announcements of 12 November 2025, 19 November 2025 and 24 December 2025), Firering now holds a 90 percent interest in Atex and a 51 percent interest in Alliance, both lithium-tantalum projects located in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. These assets are fully unencumbered.\nThe Board continues to monitor improving lithium market conditions, which it believes are increasingly highlighting the compelling value fundamentals of both projects. In this context, Firering has received third-party interest in Atex and Alliance, reinforcing their underlying value within the Company's portfolio.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals. The Company is currently focused on ramping up production at the Limeco lime project in Zambia, in which it holds a 30.7% interest with an option to increase this to 45%. Targeting daily output of 600-800 tonnes, Limeco is well positioned to supply copper producers operating within the Central African Copperbelt and gold producers operating in Zimbabwe. Additionally, Firering is progressing the Atex Lithium-Tantalum Project in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a highly prospective asset with significant lithium and tantalum-niobium potential, supporting the global shift to clean energy technologies.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Increasing our ownership, strengthening leadership at the asset level and commencing hot commissioning of Kiln 2 demonstrate our clear focus on scaling our flagship operation. With Yuval now focused entirely on leading Limeco on the ground, we are well positioned to optimise output, enhance operational performance and unlock meaningful shareholder value. I would like to thank Yuval for his significant time, commitment and contribution to the Board, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him as he drives Limeco forward.\"\nDETAILS\nOperations Update\nLimeco has commenced hot commissioning of Kiln 2 anticipated to take 10-14 days. Once commissioning is complete, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximately three-month optimisation period. This represents an important milestone in increasing Limeco's production capacity and advancing the business toward steady-state production. Further updates will be provided as commissioning of Kiln 2 progresses and the optimisation phase advances.\nLimeco Option\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has notified the relevant parties of its intention to exercise the next tranche of the Option, which will increase its shareholding from 30.7 percent to 36.2 percent. The cash consideration to be paid amounts to US$981,667. This decision reflects the Board's continued confidence in Limeco as production ramps up.\nLimeco\nIn its most recent published accounts (financial year ended 31 December 2024), Limeco posted a loss before tax of ZMW 222,443,499 (US$8,496,696\u2020) on turnover of ZMW 26,296,833 (US$1,004,463\u2020). As at 31 December 2024, Limeco had net liabilities of ZMW 2,867,291,084 (US$102,844,013\u2021). Liabilities included ZMW 2,914,751,858 (US$104,546,336\u2021) due to shareholders (\"Shareholders Loan\"). Following the exercise of the third tranche of the Option, Firering increases its right to 36.2% (cUS$28.1m\u2021) of the Shareholders Loan.\nNotes\n* the Option was described as the \"New Option\" in the Company's notification of 28 May 2024 which sets out detail of the Share Purchase Agreement and Option arrangements\n\u2020 at the exchange rate of Zambian Kwacha (ZMW) 26.18 : $1\n\u2021 at the exchange rate of ZMW 27.88 : $1\nDirectorship Change\nAs Limeco continues to represent the Company's primary value driver, Mr Yuval Cohen has stepped down with immediate effect from his roles as CEO and Director of Firering to focus exclusively on his position as CEO of Limeco. Yuval has been closely involved in Limeco's development to date, and his full-time focus is expected to strengthen operational execution and accelerate the business's commercial progress. Youval Rasin, Firering's Chairman, has been appointed as Interim CEO of Firering whilst a permanent replacement in sought.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

These developments position Limeco as a responsible, long-term supplier of lime products to the mining, food, and industrial sectors.\"\nDETAILS\nRicca Resources US$1M Settlement\nFurther to updates announced on the 19 November 2025 and 12 December 2025, all the Share Purchase Agreement completion conditions have been satisfied and Skylark has transferred US$1m to settle all outstanding amounts due from Ricca.\nFirering expects Ricca will make a distribution of net proceeds to Ricca shareholders following completion of the sale of a subsidiary asset for A$4.4m (approximately \u00a32.2 million), subject to an adjustment of up to A$332,000 (approximately \u00a3166,000) payable to Skylark Minerals Limited (ASX:SKM) (Skylark). Firering holds a 10.6% shareholding in Ricca.\nBackground to the Placing and Subscription\nFirering has raised additional funds via a Placing and Subscription principally to cover general working capital requirements, the property transfer tax charges in relation to the transfer of the shares it has already acquired in Limeco and to cover its share of any potential Limeco operating expenditures.\nPlacing\nThe Placing has been undertaken by the Company's broker Shard Capital Partners LLP ('Shard') and has raised, in aggregate, gross proceeds of \u00a30.585m through the placing of 46,800,000 new ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\") to certain investors at a price (\"Issue Price\") of 1.25 pence per share.\u00a0The Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 7 percent to the Closing Price of 1.35 pence per Ordinary Share on 23 December 2025, being the latest practicable business day prior to this announcement.\nThe Placing is conditional upon Admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM by 13 January 2026. The Company has agreed to pay Shard certain commission on the funds raised in addition to the grant of 2,808,000 warrants over Ordinary Shares (the 'Broker Warrants').

In addition, Firering anticipates a net proceed distribution to shareholders by Ricca, following the completion of a subsidiary asset sale by Ricca for A$4.4m (c\u00a32.2m) less an adjustment of up to A$332k (c\u00a3166k) to Skylark Minerals Limited (ASX: SKM) (\"Skylark\").\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nFirering to receive US$1m in cash from Skylark Minerals Limited to settle all outstanding amounts due from Ricca\n\u00b7\nCompletion expected following Ricca shareholders' approval at an EGM to be convened after a 21 day notice period\n\u00b7\nFirering expects to receive further funds via a shareholders' distribution from the net proceeds of Ricca's subsidiary asset sale, at a value of A$4.4m, Firering is a 10.6% shareholder in Ricca.\n\u00b7\nProceeds will be sufficient to fund the third tranche of Firering's option over its primary value driver, Limeco - option due date 30 January 2026, to increase Firering's interest in Limeco to 36.2%.\nYuval Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of Firering, commented:\n\"This is a significant and timely transaction for Firering, delivering a clear cash outcome that strengthens our financial position and supports our strategic priorities. The settlement of the Ricca debt, combined with the anticipated distribution to shareholders of the net proceeds from the asset sale to Skylark, will provide the funds to complete the next tranche of our Limeco option, increasing our stake to 36.2%. With production ramping up at Limeco and expansion plans progressing, we are well positioned to become a leading regional lime products producer and supplier.\"\nDETAILS\nBackground\nOn 2 November 2022, Firering entered into an earn-in agreement (\"EIA\") with Ricca relating to its Atex and Alliance Lithium-Tantalum Projects in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (together, the \"Projects\").\nOn 19 August 2025, Firering announced receipt of Ricca's formal notice of withdrawal from the EIA. Following that withdrawal, Ricca relinquished all of its interests in the Projects. Firering now retains a 90% interest in Atex and a 51% interest in Alliance, both free of any Ricca rights or obligations.\nDuring the term of the EIA, Firering contributed funding to the Projects, which was to be reimbursed by Ricca (from which the dispute (referred to below) arose), and acquired shares representing approximately 10.6% of Ricca's issued share capital.\nTransaction Summary\nUnder the Deed of Settlement (\"DoS\") executed on 10 November 2025 between Firering, Ricca, and Skylark, Skylark has agreed to pay Firering US$1m as full and final settlement to resolve a dispute between Ricca and Firering under the EIA.\nThe total cash consideration is payable to Firering with completion conditional upon approval of Ricca shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (\"EGM\") of the Share Purchase Agreement and Option Sale and Purchase Agreement entered between Ricca and Skylark. In accordance with statutory requirements, Ricca shareholders must be given at least 21 days' notice of the EGM. Completion is expected to occur immediately following the EGM.\nThrough the Share Purchase Agreement* transaction entered between Ricca and Skylark, Ricca is expected to receive gross proceeds of A$4.4m (c\u00a32.2m), less an adjustment of up to A$332k (c\u00a3166k). Through the Option Sale and Purchase Agreement* a further sum of A$500k may be received by Ricca upon exercise by Skylark, less any adjustments for accrued liabilities. It is anticipated that Ricca will distribute net proceeds from this asset sale to shareholders. Firering is currently a 10.6% shareholder in Ricca.\nUse of Proceeds\nProceeds from the transaction will be applied primarily to fund the exercise of the third tranche (of $981,667) of Firering's option in Limeco Resources Limited (\"Limeco\"), due by 30 January 2026.\nUpon exercise and payment of the third tranche, Firering's ownership in Limeco will increase to approximately 36.2%, further strengthening its position in the rapidly expanding Zambian quicklime market.\nNext Steps\nFirering will provide a further update upon completion of the sale following Ricca shareholders' approval.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Br",

Please submit questions to firering@stbridespartners.co.uk by 9:00\nam on 1 October 2025. No material new financial or other information will be disclosed.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nIn May 2024, we embarked on a transformational reset of the Company centred on acquiring management control and a material interest in Limeco Resources Limited ('Limeco'), a developed quicklime project in Zambia. Since then, we have focused on refurbishing and modernising Limeco's plant to ensure sustainable production of quicklime, supporting the region's growing industries, from copper and gold processing to other vital industrial applications that underpin regional growth and development.\nLimeco\nThe Limeco project combines a substantial limestone resource with an integrated processing operation including a two-stage crushing circuit capable of processing 300 tonnes per hour of feedstock, which is then calcined in a bank of eight kilns designed for quicklime production.\nDuring 2024, the team initiated an optimisation programme at the project, commissioning the first of two gasifiers in February 2025 alongside Kiln 1. Early ramp-up of Kiln 1 highlighted some familiar industry challenges, including blockages referred to as\nhangups\nor\nring formations\nalong the refractory lining. While such issues are inherent in lime production, they can be mitigated through tighter feedstock control and refined operating procedures. Drawing on this early experience, Limeco implemented targeted improvements, including optimising feed particle size and moisture, upgrading process controls, and refining blockage detection and removal protocols.\nThese adjustments delivered tangible progress: from 10 May to 19 July 2025, Kiln 1 produced commercial-grade quicklime on a consistent basis, averaging around 40 tpd. More recently, we made further improvements including the installation of a new Induced Draft ('ID') fan motor to enhance efficiency and stability, resulting in output increasing to 45-50 tpd, with recent output reaching 55 tpd. This marks an important proof of concept for our refurbishment strategy and confirms that with targeted investment and disciplined engineering Limeco is well positioned to create meaningful value for shareholders.\nTo unlock additional capacity, refurbishment of Kiln 2 is progressing, including the removal of internal arches, an improvement aimed at resolving the uneven heat distribution experienced in Kiln 1, and the construction of new access ports to the kiln called 'poke holes', to monitor material flow and monitor product quality. Once Kiln 2 is operational, these same enhancements will be implemented in Kiln 1 and the rest of the kilns as they come online, increasing overall quality and throughput. Hot commissioning of Kiln 2 is targeted for Q4 2025, after which Kilns 3 and 4 will be upgraded in sequence, each benefitting from the lessons learned to accelerate ramp-up.\nElsewhere on site, Limeco was awarded a Mining licence and plans to restart mining during 2026 to supplement the current 150,000+ tonne stockpile. Additionally, sales of aggregates and other ancillary revenues continue to provide useful cash flow for the operation, with plans underway to expand this stream through the eventual erection of a cement plant currently stored in containers on site.\nWhile the commissioning has faced unfor",

A strengthening sales pipeline with a more diverse product range firmly puts Limeco on track to become a leading supplier of high-quality quicklime to the region.\"\nDETAILS\nFirering remains focused on scaling up production at Limeco, which is targeting output of between 600 and 800 tonnes of quicklime per day across its eight-kiln plant.\nFirst production from Kiln 1 was achieved in Q1 2025 (see RNS dated 27 February 2025), reaching approximately 40tpd before being taken offline on 19 July 2025 for scheduled maintenance and performance upgrades. During this period, Limeco completed several enhancements, most notably the installation of a new ID fan motor and Variable Speed Drive (\"VSD\") to improve operational efficiency and reliability. Kiln 1 was successfully re-fired in early August, achieving full operational temperature as planned, and has since stabilised at approximately 45-50tpd of kiln material produced.\nWork on Kiln 2 refurbishment is underway with final equipment being shipped from India and hot commissioning on track over the coming months. Building on the operational experience from Kiln\n1, enhancements are being implemented in Kiln\n2, which\n,\nonce proven\n,\nwill be rolled out across the remaining kilns, including Kiln\n1, ensuring smoother ramp-ups and improved performance for all.\nAlongside operational progress, Limeco's commercial pipeline continues to strengthen. Buying interest is strong, with demand sufficient to support the additional kilns coming online, and importantly, Limeco now has buyers across all product categories. This was highlighted by a recent sale to a trader for both higher and lower-grade quicklime marking the launch of a new revenue stream from material previously considered unsaleable. To accelerate growth, Limeco has appointed an in-house salesperson with extensive quicklime experience in Zambia, while further product lines for both local and regional markets are under evaluation.\nFeedstock for Kiln\n1 has been drawn from a stockpile exceeding 150,000\ntonnes. Looking ahead and having secured a Mining Licence for its Tier\n1 limestone deposit, Limeco plans to commence mining during Q4 2026, once the existing stockpile that is currently being drawn from is close to depletion. The Mining Licence is valid for an initial 10-year term with renewal provisions and encompasses the entire area containing Limeco's JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate of 145.2 Mt at 95.7% CaCO\u2083 (Earthlab, November 2024, see RNS dated 27 November 2024). The resource comprises 11.8Mt Measured, 55.4Mt Indicated, and 78.0Mt Inferred, providing sufficient reserves to support over 50 years of quicklime production.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

There is no obligation on the Company to repay or refund any consideration received, or expenditures covered by Ricca during the term of the EIA. Additionally, the Company made certain funds available to the Projects (to be reimbursed by Ricca under the EIA) in order to advance the Projects during the term of the EIA up until withdrawal which the Company believes are outstanding to be repaid to it. The Company is in dialogue with Ricca seeking to resolve and finalise the amounts owing to the Company. As a result of the EIA, the Company received shares in the capital of Ricca which currently amounts to an approximate shareholding in Ricca of 10.6%.\nYuval Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of Firering, commented:\n\"Ricca's withdrawal from the earn-in to our Atex and Alliance Lithium-Tantalum Projects transfers full control of these assets to Firering, and also equips the Company with the flexibility to explore alternative ways to crystalize their value. While currently on care and maintenance, the Company remains confident in the significant unrealised potential of Atex and Alliance, and the Board is actively evaluating opportunities to unlock and maximise this value for shareholders.\n\"Under the terms of the EIA, Firering will also retain its ~10% equity interest in Ricca and we are also working to recover the funds advanced for the furtherance of the Projects (and to be repaid by Ricca under the EIA) during the partnership, which will be directed towards accelerating the development of our flagship Limeco operations. Limeco remains at the heart of our business, offering scalable near-term revenues and the foundation for Firering's long-term value creation alongside the additional upside that we expect to realise ultimately from the Atex and Alliance Projects.\"\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

With the quicklime market remaining buoyant and fundamentals strong, this further investment underscores our confidence in the project's long-term value and our strategy to become a key player in the space.\"\nBackground\nOn 28 May 2024, Firering announced that it had entered into\na share purchase agreement, together with Clearglass Investments Limited (\"Clearglass\") and Kai Group Ltd, the then sole shareholder of Limeco (\"Vendor\"), to acquire an initial 20.5% of Limeco, the owner of an advanced limestone project (\"the Project\") located 22km west of Lusaka in Zambia. Additionally, Firering was granted an option (as set out below) to acquire a further\n24.5\n% interest in Limeco for an aggregate consideration of US$4,650,000 (\"Option\") to potentially take its interest in Limeco to 45%.\nHaving completed the acquisition of the initial 20.5% of Limeco, Firering's Option is exercisable in five tranches between July 2025 and July 2026 as follows:\n\u00b7\nan option to acquire a 6.4% interest no later than 31 July 2025 for a payment of US$1,033,333;\n\u00b7\nan option to acquire a 3.8% interest no later than 30 October 2025 for a payment of US$620,000;\n\u00b7\nan option to acquire a 5.5% interest no later than 30 January 2026 for a payment of US$981,667;\n\u00b7\nan option to acquire a 5.5% interest no later than 30 April 2026 for a payment of US$981,667; and\n\u00b7\nan option to acquire a 3.3% interest no later than 31 July 2026 for a payment of US$1,033,333.\nExercise of first tranche of the Option\nFirering has today notified the Vendor of its intention to exercise the first tranche of the Option to acquire a further 6.4% interest in Limeco. On completion, this will take the Company's shareholding in Limeco to 26.9%.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Option, the Company is required to make a payment of US$1,033,333 in consideration for this tranche. The payment will be satisfied using a combination of the Company's existing cash resources and the proceeds of its recently announced fundraisings. While the Option has been exercised, completion of this share acquisition will occur once the payment has been settled in full.\nLimeco\nIn its most recent published accounts (financial year ended 31 December 2024), Limeco posted a loss before tax of ZMW 222,443,499 (\u20ac7,851,871\u2020) on turnover of ZMW 26,296,833 (\u20ac928,233\u2020).

The Notice of AGM will be sent to shareholders and the Notice of AGM and Accounts will be made available to download later today from the Company's website\nwww.fireringplc.com\n.\nOVERVIEW\n\u00b7\nExecuted a strategic pivot to prioritise Limeco, an advanced, near-term quicklime production opportunity in Zambia with strong cash flow potential.\n\u00b7\nAcquired an initial 20.5% interest in Limeco, with an option to increase interest to 45%; advanced discussions with a leading Zambian bank to fund the option.\n\u00b7\nFocused on optimising Limeco's high-capacity lime plant ahead of phased kiln recommissioning, with full production of c.200ktpa targeted for 2026.\n\u00b7\nPublished a maiden JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate confirming 50+ years of potential production, positioning Limeco as Zambia's leading future quicklime supplier.\n\u00b7\nRecorded first commercial sales of quicklime, with purity levels exceeding typical metallurgical industry requirements, in early June 2025.\n\u00b7\nEstablished complementary revenue streams as part of zero-waste strategy, including sales of aggregate, which reached nameplate capacity of over 30ktpm in January 2025.\n\u00b7\nProgressed the Atex Lithium Project in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, increasing known mineralisation by 122% to an 800-metre strike length; preparations are underway to define a maiden JORC resource.\nCommenting on the results Yuval Cohen, CEO of Firering said:\n\"2024 marked a pivotal year for Firering as we undertook a strategic reset to focus on the Limeco quicklime project in Zambia, a near-term production asset with highly attractive fundamentals. With demand for quicklime continuing to grow, particularly as a critical reagent in a range of industrial processes including copper production, which itself is set for significant expansion, we are pleased to have been able to increase our interest in this exciting project during the year and oversee a comprehensive programme of redevelopment and optimisation.\n\"Early momentum has been encouraging. The first of Limeco's eight kilns was successfully brought online in Q1 2025, followed by first sales in Q2. Furthermore, a clear pathway is now established to ramp up to the project's nameplate production capacity of approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum in 2026.\n\"As we look ahead, we do so with renewed strategic clarity, strengthened operational focus, and a firm commitment to building long-term value and delivering a compelling growth story for all our stakeholders.\"\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\nT: +44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nThe following is extracted from the Annual Report and Accounts:\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n2024 was a transformational year for Firering, one in which we refocused our strategy and laid the foundations for scalable, long-term growth. This realignment marked a shift from a pure-play explorer into a dual-pronged business model that combines cash-generative production from industrial minerals with long-term value creation from our critical minerals exploration portfolio.\nCentral to this strategic evolution was our decision to prioritise the development of Limeco Resources Limited (\"Limeco\"), a vertically integrated quicklime production asset in Zambia. With over US$100 million of historical investment and an advanced infrastructure base, including a Tier 1 limestone deposit, two-stage crushing circuit, and eight-kiln lime plant, production at this significant and strategically important asset is ramping up, targeting between 600 and 800 tonnes of quicklime per day in 2026.\nFollowing the successful co",

In parallel, upgrade work on the next three of the site's eight kilns (Kilns 2-4) is now underway, marking the next phase of operational ramp-up.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFirst quicklime sales secured to local and regional customers.\n\u00b7\nOptimisation of Kiln 1 is ongoing with high-quality quicklime being produced.\n\u00b7\nWork has commenced on modifying and commissioning Kiln 2, followed by Kiln 3 and then Kiln 4.\n\u00b7\nSales from aggregates and other ancillary products and services continue to provide a stable revenue base as kiln commissioning progresses.\n\u00b7\nAdvancing discussions with a leading Zambian bank to secure funding to increase interest in Limeco to 45% and repay Bridge Loan.\nYuval Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of Firering, commented:\n\"We are delighted to report Limeco's first sales of quicklime have been secured, which is a major milestone in our journey towards establishing the operation as a leading regional supplier of this essential industrial product. While its optimisation continues to progress carefully and steadily, Kiln 1 is currently producing commercial quality quicklime at around 50 tonnes per day and serving as a robust operational model as we move into the commissioning of Kilns 2-4.\n\"The ramp-up at Limeco is well timed, aligning with the Zambian government's drive to increase copper output, evidenced by a 30% year-on-year rise in Q1 2025. By producing high-purity quicklime locally, Limeco reduces reliance on imports, cuts transport costs and emissions, and delivers a more cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable solution that supports Zambia's industrial growth and decarbonisation goals.\"\nDetails\nLimeco operates a large-scale limestone project approximately 22km west of Lusaka, Zambia. The site is strategically located to service the rapidly growing copper production industry in the Central African Copperbelt, as well as broader regional markets.\nThe optimisation of the first of eight kilns is ongoing with current daily quicklime production standing at around 50 tonnes; steady-state output is targeted at 80 to 100 tonnes per day. The kiln is producing quicklime of excellent quality, with purity levels of 85-90%, well above the 80% industry benchmark for metallurgical applications. This high product quality has generated strong early interest, resulting in sales secured with local and regional customers. Due to commercial sensitivities, spot pricing and customer information will be disclosed only as required under regulatory obligations.\nWhile the optimisation of Kiln 1 has taken slightly longer than initially anticipated due to intermittent blockages, a common occurrence in global kiln operations, Limeco has now gained better insights in managing the various operating parameters, feed, gas and air flows, discharge regime, which will assist in streamlining operations. This process will be replicated in a modular fashion across the remaining seven kilns. Limeco has commenced modifications to Kiln 2, followed by Kilns 3 and 4.\nIn parallel, Limeco continues to generate cash flow from aggregate sales and other ancillary revenue streams, providing a strong operational foundation as the kiln commissioning progresses.\nStabilising production at Kiln 1 and generating revenue were the final key milestones required to progress discussions with a leading Zambian bank in relation to the previously agreed non-binding term sheet (see RNS dated 15 November 2024). With these milestones now achieved, discussions are advancing with the objective of securing funding that would enable Firering to increase its interest in Limeco to 45% and repay the outstanding Bridge Loan.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\nT: +44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

SPARK Advisory Partners Limited (\"SPARK\") is acting as nominated adviser to the Company.\n\u00b7\nThe New Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Fundraise will be issued and allotted under the Company's existing allotment and disapplication of pre-emption rights authorities obtained at the Company's last annual general meeting held on 12 August 2024.\n\u00b7\nBy way of an update, on the previously announced non-dilutive bank finance is at an advanced stage. A non-binding term sheet has been signed and the loan is now being reviewed by the Senior investment committee. The Company expects to receive final comments from the bank shortly and then seek to finalise loan terms as soon as possible. To mitigate the risk of not completing the process before the SPA Deadline of 30 April 2025, the Board has decided to proceed with the Fundraise.\nYuval Cohen, Chief Executive of Firering, commented:\n\"\"Progress at Limeco continues at pace, with the first production milestone now achieved, the ramp up continuing in line with expectations, and inaugural sales expected shortly. Our focus will then shift to bringing the remaining seven kilns online over the coming months. Notably, the Project is coming on stream at a critical time to meet the growing demand for quicklime, driven by a surge in copper mining activity in the region, where it plays a vital role in processing. As operations scale up to full capacity, Firering is well positioned to unlock the full value of this exciting asset and deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\n\"The loan application with the Zambian bank is now at an advanced stage, and will principally be used to increase our interest in Limeco to 45%. However, with the end of-April deadline approaching for settlement of the next tranche of consideration, we have decided to proceed with the Fundraise to ensure we successfully complete the transaction to take our interest in Limeco to 20.5%.\"\nBACKGROUND TO, AND REASONS FOR, THE FUNDRAISE\nLimeco's Operations\nLimeco's integrated limestone project in Zambia encompasses a Tier 1 limestone deposit and a processing plant. With production expected to reach full capacity by Q1 2026, the project is poised to meet the growing demands of the Central African Copperbelt's expanding copper industry, alongside other key sectors currently reliant on importing quicklime from South Africa.\nInitially established by Glencore plc to address a quicklime shortage in Zambia, Limeco has seen over $100 million invested in the development of the mine and processing plant. The project includes a high-quality Tier 1 limestone deposit, forming the cornerstone of Limeco's robust quicklime business, alongside a state-of-the-art lime plant, which includes:\n\u00b7\nA two-stage crushing circuit with an installed primary throughput capacity of 300 tonnes per hour (tph) of limestone comprising a jaw and an impact crusher, followed by two sets of screens - a double and triple deck.\n\u00b7\nEight vertical kilns for burning the crushed limestone (the +60 mm to -90 mm fraction separated by the double deck screen) to produce between 600 to 800 tonnes of quicklime per day. The -60 mm stream from the crushing circuit is passed through the triple deck screen to split it into three aggregate size fractions.\nThe project also has an on-site laboratory to test calcium carbonate (\"CaCO3\") and quicklime (\"CaO\") content to meet the specifications of potential offtakers. To date, testwork has produced CaO results between 92% and 94%, aligning with target specifications.\nThis is a zero-waste project, with all waste streams being repurposed for ancillary products and services, such as aggregate production, underscoring Limeco's commitment to sustainable practices.\nMineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\")\nLim",

Our focus now is on steadily ramping up production to full capacity while ensuring the consistent delivery of high-quality quicklime to meet the growing demands of the Central African Copperbelt and Agricultural sectors. We look forward to providing updates on the production ramp-up from Kiln 1 and first quicklime sales in the coming weeks.\"\nDetails\nFirering has started its phased production strategy at its Limeco quicklime project in Zambia, as it focuses on potentially becoming Zambia's largest quicklime producer, targeting a daily output of 600-800 tonnes.\nHaving recently fired the first of two planned new gasifiers and heated the first of eight kilns to over 1,000\u00b0C, production of quicklime has now commenced. Each kiln is fed with crushed limestone (-90mm to +60mm), sourced from Limeco's Tier 1 deposit, and is expected to produce between 80-100 tonnes of quicklime daily. Approximately 50,000 tonnes of crushed kiln feed material is currently stockpiled near the plant, sufficient to support well over six months of production for Kiln 1 operating at full capacity. This stockpile is continuously replenished, with smaller size fractions continuing to be sold as aggregate to local industries. Notably, aggregate production from the -60mm stream has already reached nameplate capacity, contributing to Limeco's positive operational cash flow (see RNS dated 22 January 2025).\nFollowing a period of fine tuning the production process, which is expected to be approximately 30 days, Limeco expects to commence its first quicklime sales shortly thereafter.\nIssue of Equity and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the admission of a total of 263,000 ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\") issued to an adviser at an issue price of c.4.6 pence in settlement of fees for services provided of \u00a312,000 (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective on or around 7 March 2025. Following Admission, the Company's issued share capital will consist of 184,508,717 Ordinary Shares which may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which to determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\nT: +44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\nfirering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc, an AIM-listed resource company, is positioned to scale up production in 2025 at its quicklime project in Zambia to produce 600-800 tonnes of quicklime daily along with a range of ancillary products.

The gasifier has been running successfully since 10 February and Kiln 1 will be refired later this week at which point the first quicklime will be produced and announced within days. This will be followed by an estimated 30-day optimisation period. This is a key step towards achieving full-scale operations across all eight kilns by the end of 2025. Once at steady-state production (100 tonnes of quicklime per kiln per day) Limeco will produce over 200,000 tonnes annually, establishing itself as one of Zambia's largest quicklime producers and an important supplier to the growing copper industry in the Central African Copperbelt.\"\nDetails\nFollowing the successful commissioning of the gasifier and Kiln 1, phased production is now underway at the Limeco project, with a target of 600-800 tonnes of quicklime per day by the end of 2025. A key development in this process has been the conversion of the fuel source for the eight lime kilns from Heavy Fuel Oil to gasification. This successful change will improve operational efficiency and significantly reduce plant operating costs.\nHaving commenced mechanical commissioning of Kiln 1 in December 2024 and the first gasifier in January 2025, firing both the gasifier and Kiln 1 last week is a major achievement for Limeco. The gasifier has been successfully and consistently running since 10 February, enabling the Company to move forward to refiring the kiln following commissioning adjustments, with crushed limestone (-90mm to +60mm), at the end of this week. Over several days, the temperature inside the kiln will gradually rise to approximately 1,000\u00b0C. Once this temperature is reached, the limestone will undergo a thermal decomposition process, known as calcination, for 7 to 9 hours, producing high-quality calcium oxide (CaO), or quicklime. Following the delivery of this first quicklime production, we expect to have a period of approximately 30 days to optimise production quantity and quality.\nThe first kiln, like the remaining seven kilns, is expected to produce up to 100 tonnes of quicklime per day, operated continuously on a 24/7 basis, with only brief pauses for scheduled maintenance. This efficient process ensures a steady supply of quicklime, maximising energy usage while minimising waste.\nFigure 1: Successful firing of the gasifier (10 February 2025).\nFigure 2: Successful firing of burners of Kiln 1 (12 February 2025).\nFigure 3: View of gasifier and gas ducting connecting gasifier to lime plant.\nFigure 4: View of gasifier.\n\u200b\nFigure 5: View of gasifier with lime plant in the background.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\nT: +44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\nfirering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc, an AIM-listed resource company, is positioned to scale up production in 2025 at its quicklime project in Zambia to produce 600-800 tonnes of quicklime daily along with a range of ancillary products.

This has also driven a material uplift in operating cashflow in Q4 2024 compared Q3 2024.\n\u00b7\nFirst production of core quicklime product imminent.\nYuval Cohen, Chief Executive of Firering, said:\n\"While our primary focus remains on scaling up production of our core quicklime product to reach full capacity by year-end, we are equally pleased to have already achieved nameplate capacity for aggregate production. This milestone follows the successful completion of renovations to the crushing plant, enabling us to stockpile crushed limestone while optimising the use of the waste stream for aggregate production. This not only enhances operational efficiency and delivers strong cash flow but also significantly reduces waste, reflecting our commitment to sustainable practices.\"\nDetails\nFirering continues to make excellent progress advancing Limeco with first production of its core quicklime product imminent. When fully commissioned, able to produce 600-800 tpd quicklime over a +50-year life of mine, Limeco will potentially\u00a0be the largest quicklime operation in Zambia, positioned to support the Copperbelt's rapidly expanding copper production needs.\nAdditionally, in line with its strategy to create multiple revenue streams, production of aggregate, with the benefit of a new primary crusher installed in July 2024, has also been ramping up. Having completed renovations to the crushing plant, production of aggregate has reached nameplate capacity of 350,000 tonnes per annum. Aggregate sold to date is being consumed by local industrial companies.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\ninfo@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan / Adam Dawes\n+44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\n+44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\n+44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nfirering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc, an AIM-listed resource company, is positioned to scale up production in 2025 at its quicklime project in Zambia to produce 600-800 tonnes of quicklime daily along with a range of ancillary products.

Furthermore, the construction of the gasifier is nearing completion. This is an exciting but busy period for Limeco as it gears up for steady quicklime production from its first kiln while advancing efforts to bring the remaining seven kilns online in phases during 2025. These achievements are set to establish Limeco as potentially Zambia's largest quicklime producer.\"\nDETAILS\nFirering is making significant progress advancing its integrated quicklime project in Zambia, Limeco. The project comprises a Tier 1 deposit totalling 145.2Mt at 95.7% CaCO3 and a lime plant with eight kilns designed to burn crushed limestone, producing 600-800 tonnes of quicklime daily. Once operating at full capacity, Limeco will be potentially the largest quicklime producer in Zambia, with a mine life exceeding 50 years, positioned to meet the growing demands of the copper industry and other industrial sectors.\nFollowing the project timeline, commissioning of the first of eight kilns began in early December 2024 with test runs. This will be followed with the production of the first quicklime after a matter of weeks into the new year.\nFinal modifications to Kiln 1 were completed at the end of November 2024 (Table 1) incorporating new discharge gates, slide gates, and a vibratory feeder (Figure 1). Subsequently, Kiln 1 was loaded with limestone and underwent dry-run testing to empty the kiln (Figure 2).\nProgress on the coal gasifier is advancing steadily, with around 50% of the steel structure, including the first platform, now installed (Figure 3). Additionally, construction of the coal storage facility is approximately 75% complete (Figure 4), while the delivery of the water purification plant is expected this week.\nThe newly installed impact crusher continues to perform efficiently, having processed approximately 87,000 tonnes of limestone to date since being commissioned in Q3 2024. Kiln feed, comprising the -90mm to +60mm size fraction, has been stockpiled near the lime plant, with a total of ~26,000 tonnes currently available (Figure 5).\nFinally, aggregate production from the minus 60mm stream remains a strong contributor, accounting for 50% of Limeco's positive operational cash flow.\nTable 1: Status of modifications and repairs at Kiln 1\nItem\nStatus\nComment\nDischarge cone\nCompleted\nIncreased discharge opening\nRotary table\nCompleted\nModified opening\nNew skip hoist brakes\nCompleted\nSingle drum changed to double drum\nNew discharge and slide gates\nCompleted\nNew burner ports and burners\nCompleted\nBurners to be connected to gas piping\nFeed conveyor to skip hoist\nCompleted\nSkip hoist\nCompleted\nPan conveyor\nCompleted\nRoller crusher\nCompleted\nBucket elevator\nCompleted\nSilo storage and bag plant\nCompleted\nModified exhaust stack\nCompleted\nInstalled on 30 October 2024\nFigure 1: View of discharge and slide gates (left) and vibratory feeder above pan conveyor (right).\nFigure 2: Skip with -90 to 60mm material at top of Kiln 1 (left); emptying limestone from Kiln1 (right).\nFigure 3: View of the steel structure and 1st platform from the lime plant (left); view of the gasifier with 1st platform (right).\nFigure 4: View of coal storage facility.\nFigure 5: View of part of the kiln feed with lime plant in the background.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\ninfo@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan / Adam Dawes\n+44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\n+44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\n+44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brid",

This firmly positions Limeco to become the largest quicklime producer in Zambia and a prominent regional player for many years to come, enabling it to meet the growing demands of the copper industry and other industrial clients.\n\"Earthlab has once again demonstrated that Limeco's high-quality Tier 1 limestone deposit forms the foundation of its robust quicklime business. Following the identification of three distinct domains within the Project, A, B, and C, including the new exploration licence granted in September, Domain A has been the primary area of focus. However, Domains B and C present significant opportunities for Limeco to unlock additional value in the future, with potential applications across various industries.\"\nDETAILS\nAligned with its strategy to fully capitalise on the significant market opportunities for quicklime in the Zambian Copperbelt, given its essential role in copper production, Firering commissioned\nEarthlab Exploration and Mining Consulting (Pty) Ltd (\"Earthlab\")\nto undertake a maiden JORC-compliant MRE for its Limeco quicklime project in Zambia. This study incorporated Limeco's newly granted exploration licence (see RNS dated 3 September 2024).\nThe newly published MRE (November 2024) revealed a 97% increase in tonnage compared to Limeco's 2017 non-compliant estimated mineral resource of 73.7Mt at 95.3% CaCO3. The updated estimate totals 145.2Mt at 95.7% CaCO3, comprising 11.8Mt in the Measured category, 55.4Mt in Indicated, and 78.0Mt in Inferred (Table 2).\nNotably, the maiden MRE enables over 50 years of potential quicklime production.\nThe MRE incorporates a detailed analysis of the deposit's geological structure, including its physical and chemical properties and associated facies. The local geology is characterised by a depositional setting typical of a lagoonal-shoals shelf environment, where wind and still water deposited sediments forming wackstone, packstone and upward grainstone in horizontal to wavy grey laminated layers (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Proposed depositional setting of the project area (Saller, 2001).\nBased on the geological interpretation and the chemical signatures displayed by the exploration data, Earthlab was able to divide the limestone deposit into geological facies with unique chemical data populations. The demarcated geological facies coincide with statistical domains that have been processed geostatistically to produce the MRE (Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Plan view of the domain wireframes with drill hole collars superimposed (Earthlab, November 2024).\nTo estimate the resource tonnes, Earthlab created a potential final pit shell (Figure 3) by applying modifying factors as per the guidelines of JORC, which dictate that resource tonnes should be estimated based on Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (\"RPEEE\").\nFigure 3: Representation of the pit shell; the lime plant can be seen in the upper right corner (Earthlab, November 2024).\nEarthlab completed the mineral resource classification for the entire model (Figure 4) and for the final pit shell (Figure 5).\nFigure 4: Final classification for Domains A, B, and C (Earthlab, November 2024).\nFigure 5: Final classification for the optimised pit shell (Earthlab, November 2024).\nPIT OPTIMISATION RUNS\nEarthlab's pit optimisation runs indicated a negligible stripping ratio with low sensitivity to costs and pricing (Table 1).\nTable 1: Sensitivity of ore tonnage to changes in plant operating costs and quicklime prices (Earthlab, November 2024).\nTable 1 shows that by more than doubling the lime plant operating costs from USD7 per ROM tonne to USD15 per ROM tonne, while keeping the quickl",

Modifications to the first kiln are nearly complete, with commissioning of both the kiln and gasifier targeted for Q4 2024. Laboratory test work has also accelerated, supported by the completion of a pilot kiln, which has yielded initial quicklime (CaO) results between 92% and 94%. This progress is driving productive discussions with prospective clients, and accordingly we are optimistic about securing long-term offtake agreements.\n\"The upcoming two months promise to be extremely busy as we work toward the production start target, with a steady stream of news expected. This includes the release of an updated Mineral Resource Estimate as Limeco positions itself to meet the rising demand from Zambia's growing copper production market.\"\nDETAILS\nLimeco's quicklime project remains on track for phased commissioning to start in Q4 2024 with critical modifications to the first of eight kilns largely complete. Key to this is the conversion of the fuel source for these kilns from Heavy Fuel Oil (\"HFO\") to coal gasification, which will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and reduce operating costs of the plant.\nAdditionally, the aggregate crushing operation is continuing to perform very well, underpinning positive operational cashflow as well as providing an increasing stockpile for the kilns, which is now in excess of 15,000 tonnes.\nCoal gasifier\nThe first gasifier arrived on site and is now being erected.\nFigure 1: Parts of gasifier arriving at Limeco, 29 October 2024.\nFigure 2: Parts of gasifier being off loaded at lime plant, 29 October 2024.\nFigure 3: Erection of gasifier\nModifications to Kiln 1\nWork is progressing well for the commissioning of Kiln 1 by the end of Q4 2024 with the following activities concluded or in progress:\nItem\nStatus\nComment\nDischarge cone\nCompleted & operational\nIncreased discharge opening\nRotary table\nCompleted & operational\nModified opening\nNew skip hoist brakes\nCompleted & operational\nSingle drum changed to double\nNew discharge gates\nNot completed\nAwaiting arrival on site\nNew burner ports\nNot completed\nArrived & being installed\nFeed conveyor to skip hoist\nCompleted & operational\n-\nSkip hoist\nCompleted & operational\n-\nPan conveyor\nCompleted & operational\n-\nRoller crusher\nCompleted & operational\n-\nBucket elevator\nCompleted & operational\n-\nSilo discharge end\nNot completed\nWork in progress\nModified exhaust stack\nCompleted\nInstalled on 30 October 2024\nFigure 4: View of refurbished hoist structure (blue) and refurbished skip (orange).\nCoal storage facility\nWork on the coal storage facility, from where the coal will be conveyed to the coal gasifier, is 40% completed.\nFigure 5: View of incline ramp from coal storage facility to coal gasifier.\nCrushing plant\nThe newly installed impact crusher is performing well with over 60,000 tonnes of limestone crushed.

No material new financial or other information will be provided.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nDuring the period, we have focused on advancing our quicklime asset in Zambia, which presents immediate cash flow prospects and significant growth potential. This strategic decision, driven by quicklime's strong alignment with the robust copper market, will, we envisage, deliver considerable value creation for our shareholders.\nSince raising approximately \u00a32 million at the end of May to acquire an initial 10% stake in Limeco Resources Limited (Limeco), with the option to increase it to 45%, and to fund the recommissioning and ramp-up of the lime plant's operations, the pace of progress has been remarkable. Bolstered by an estimated resource of 73.7 million tonnes (Mt) at 95.3% CaCO3 and a limestone stockpile of 190,000 tonnes ready to initiate production, this exciting, fully permitted project is on track to start phased production in Q4 this year.\nAt the time of our investment, the project was in an advanced stage having seen historical investment exceeding US$100 million. However, ahead of recommissioning, Limeco has spent the past few months enhancing the crushing circuit to produce the ideal limestone size for the kilns and changing the fuel source from heavy fuel oil to coal gasification to deliver more economical heating energy. Concurrently, the on-site laboratory has been recommissioned and testwork has begun with high purity levels of calcium oxide (quicklime) achieved in line with the specifications required by our potential off takers.\nImportantly,\neven before the start of core quicklime production,\nLimeco is generating positive operational cash flow with the sale of aggregate, which commenced in October 2023, and a two-year\nlogistics services revenue agreement signed in early August 2024. Other\nancillary revenue streams\nare expected to come online in due course\nsuch as the sale of ash from the coal gasification process to the cement industry.\nSetting the stage for scaling Limeco's capacity to align with Zambia's ambitious target to increase copper output to 3Mt by 2031, Limeco applied for and was granted an additional exploration licence on 3 September 2024. This new licence, located adjacent to its existing licence, will potentially increase Limeco's significant Mineral Resource by 60 to 70Mt of ",

No material new financial or other information will be provided.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nDuring the period, we have focused on advancing our quicklime asset in Zambia, which presents immediate cash flow prospects and significant growth potential. This strategic decision, driven by quicklime's strong alignment with the robust copper market, will, we envisage, deliver considerable value creation for our shareholders.\nSince raising approximately \u00a32 million at the end of May to acquire an initial 10% stake in Limeco Resources Limited (Limeco), with the option to increase it to 45%, and to fund the recommissioning and ramp-up of the lime plant's operations, the pace of progress has been remarkable. Bolstered by an estimated resource of 73.7 million tonnes (Mt) at 95.3% CaCO3 and a limestone stockpile of 190,000 tonnes ready to initiate production, this exciting, fully permitted project is on track to start phased production in Q4 this year.\nAt the time of our investment, the project was in an advanced stage having seen historical investment exceeding US$100 million. However, ahead of recommissioning, Limeco has spent the past few months enhancing the crushing circuit to produce the ideal limestone size for the kilns and changing the fuel source from heavy fuel oil to coal gasification to deliver more economical heating energy. Concurrently, the on-site laboratory has been recommissioned and testwork has begun with high purity levels of calcium oxide (quicklime) achieved in line with the specifications required by our potential off takers.\nImportantly,\neven before the start of core quicklime production,\nLimeco is generating positive operational cash flow with the sale of aggregate, which commenced in October 2023, and a two-year\nlogistics services revenue agreement signed in early August 2024. Other\nancillary revenue streams\nare expected to come online in due course\nsuch as the sale of ash from the coal gasification process to the cement industry.\nSetting the stage for scaling Limeco's capacity to align with Zambia's ambitious target to increase copper output to 3Mt by 2031, Limeco applied for and was granted an additional exploration licence on 3 September 2024. This new licence, located adjacent to its existing licence, will potentially increase Limeco's significant Mineral Resource by 60 to 70Mt of similar-grade material. This will enhance the project's already strong economic foundation, which is currently based on the daily production of 600-800 tonnes of quicklime, projected to sustain operations for around 30 years.\nIn addition to our quicklime asset, we made progress in advancing the Atex Project in north-west C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, successfully expanding the known ",

With Zambia's ambitious goal of increasing copper production to 3 million tonnes annually by 2030, up from 760,000 tonnes in 2022, Limeco's expanded capacity could be instrumental in achieving this target.\"\nDETAILS\nLimeco is making steady progress on its limestone project, situated 22 kilometres west of Lusaka, Zambia, with initial production on track for Q4 2024 and full-scale ramp-up expected in 2025. The Project comprises a limestone quarry with an estimated mineral resource of\n73.7Mt @ 95.3% CaCO3*\nand a quicklime production facility with the potential to produce 600-800 tonnes of quicklime per day over an estimated 30-year life-of-mine.\nIn line with its strategy to fully\ncapitalise on the expansive market opportunities for quicklime in the Zambian Copper Belt given its critical role in copper production, Limeco applied for and was granted a\n392.51 hectare\n,\nSmall Scale Exploration Licence 37900-HQ-SEL\n. This complements its other two adjacent licences:\nMineral Processing Licence 21279-HQ-MPL; and Small Scale Exploration Licence 37483-HQ-SEL\n(see Figure 3)\n.\nGolder Associates (\"Golder\") highlighted an exploration target of some 95Mt in the New Licence as part of its review and MRE in 2017. Golder did not classify this target in terms of the guidelines of the JORC Code as at that time Limeco did not have mineral rights over that licence area. A plan view of the MRE reported by Golder is shown in Figure 1, while d\nrillhole collars from all past exploration campaigns are shown in Figure 2 indicating the widely spaced drillhole positions in the new licence.\nFirering engaged Earthlab Exploration and Mining Consulting (Pty) Ltd (\"Earthlab\"), independent geological and mining consultants in April 2024 to provide independent geological and mining input for the Limeco project.\nUsing Earthlab's analysis, conservative indications are that Limeco's initial MRE of\n73.7Mt @ 95.3% CaCO3\nwould increase by between 60 to 70Mt at similar grades, providing support for Limeco's operations for many decades to come.\nEarthlab commented\n: \"\nEarthlab believes that with the awarding of the additional exploration licence to Limeco, after high-level consideration was given to a boundary pillar, between 60Mt to 70Mt in the newly awarded Exploration Licence, could be classified as Inferred at similar grades after geological losses have been applied.\"\nFigure 1: Plan view of Limeco's MRE as reported by Golder in 2017; Class 1 = Measured (green), Class 2 = Indicated (blue), Class 3 = Inferred (red) and Class 4 = Exploration Target (grey).\nFigure 2: View of drillhole collars from past drilling campaigns.\nFigure 3: Plan view of the three licences owned by Limeco.\n*Source: Golder Associates, report 1776596-002-R-Rev0, 05 October 2017.\nCompetent Person\nIn accordance with the AIM Rules - Note for Mining and Oil & Gas Companies, the information contained in this announcement has been reviewed by Mr. Deon du Plessis.

Key to this plan has been the manufacturing of the coal gasifier parts, which are now on their way to Limeco having left the Port of Mundra, India, on 23 August 2024. Notably, work on the gas ducting required to convey the hot gas from the gasifier to the kilns has also started.\n\"Having replaced the double roll crusher with an impact crusher, the crushing plant is performing well and being used to build a kiln feed pile of the right quality limestone with a size fraction of -90mm to 60mm. Undersize of -60mm is guided back to the triple deck screen and split into three different aggregate streams for sale to our customers.\n\"Major progress has also been made at Limeco's onsite laboratory with the arrival of all outstanding test equipment. Accordingly, testwork to understand the impact of the different limestone qualities and burning times on the production of quicklime is in full swing with encouraging initial results showing high available quicklime content.\n\"I look forward to further updating the market on the arrival of our first gasifier and subsequent installation and commissioning of the system and the firing of our first kiln using this new system during Q4 2024.\"\nDETAILS\nLime plant\nA new conveyor belt has been installed (Figure 1) that will feed crushed limestone to the skip hoist, which transports the materials to a 25t hopper at the top of the lime plant. From there, the limestone will be fed first to Kiln 1 and later, once operational, to Kiln 2.\nFigure 1: View of newly installed conveyor belt (left) and feeding arrangement into skip hoist (right).\nTwo new brakes for the skip hoist motor arrived on-site in early August 2024 and have since been installed (Figure 2), replacing the original single brake. Brake testwork is planned for September 2024.\nFigure 2: View of newly installed brakes for the skip hoist motor.\nRepair work inside Kiln 1 has been completed including the repair of cracks, burner port, the bridge and arches underneath the bridge. Additionally, foundation work for the first gasifier is advancing (Figure 3) with the last rebar reinforcement being installed and final concrete of 1050mm poured by the first week of September 2024.\nFigure 3: Preparation work at gasifier foundation ahead of final concrete pour.\nExcavation work for the coal storage facility that will hold the coal stock that will be fed to the gasifier has commenced (Figure 4).\nFigure 4: View of excavation work at coal storage facility.\nCrushing plant\nThe new impact crusher arrived at Limeco in May and has been successfully installed (Figure 5). The primary stockpile feed first goes through the primary crusher before being processed by the impact crusher.

To contextualise, quicklime prices have ranged from US$160 to US$218 per tonne over the past two years, underscoring the significant value of our asset.\n\"Several factors drive the robust demand for quicklime, including its crucial role in copper smelting by controlling pH levels during flotation, and enhancing copper separation from other minerals. This market is particularly attractive for Limeco as it is poised to be the sole quicklime producer in the region, coinciding with increased activity in the Zambian Copperbelt. Zambia, currently the seventh largest copper producer globally, aims to boost output to 3Mt by 2032, potentially making it the second largest world producer.\n\"Accordingly, Limeco is advancing off-take discussions with copper producers while also engaging with companies in other industries such on the construction and fertiliser industries. Further, it is well-positioned to scale production to meet demand given it has a current Mineral Resource of 73.7Mt at 95.3% CaCO3 and an identified Exploration Target of 95Mt. Limeco has applied for an exploration licence, which is pending approval.\n\"Limeco's strategy focuses on generating multiple revenue streams from quicklime, aggregate, and ancillary products like ash for the concrete industry. Aggregate sales commenced in October 2023 and more recently an agreement was signed with a multinational commodity trading company to provide logistics services, which is projected to generate US$600-720k per annum. This means Limeco is positioned to generate positive operational cashflow even before the start of quicklime production in Q4 2024.\n\"While Limeco is our primary focus, we continue to advance the Atex Project, which has lithium and tantalum-niobium potential in northwest C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Following a 2022 scout drilling campaign, we completed a reverse circulation drilling campaign in March 2024, which saw us expand known lithium mineralisation by 122% and extend the strike length to 800 meters. Our next phase involves expanding exploration eastward and northward and delineating a maiden resource.\n\"With our strategic shift towards quicklime production well underway, significant milestones achieved, and more on the horizon, we are excited about Firering's future. We look forward to delivering sustained value to shareholders through diversified revenue streams, robust resource management, and strategic market engagement.\"\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nYuval Cohen\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan / Adam Dawes\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nOptiva Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\nChristian Dennis / Daniel Ingram\nT: +44 20 3137 1903\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher\nE:\nfirering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc is an AIM listed resource company set to commence commissioning its significant quicklime project in Zambia in Q4 2024 to produce 600-800 tonnes of quicklime per day along with ancillary products.

We are excited about the opportunities ahead and remain committed to maximising value for our shareholders.\"\nDetails\nFirering currently holds a 20.5% stake in Limeco Resources Limited (\"Limeco\") with an option to increase this to 45%. With historical investment exceeding US$100 million, once fully operational the Company expects Limeco will become the largest quicklime operation in Zambia able to support the Copperbelt's rapidly expanding copper production needs.\nIn line with its strategy of creating multi-revenue streams, Limeco has signed an Agreement with a multinational commodity trading company to provide logistics services. Projected to generate US$600-720k per annum, the Agreement will support the core quicklime operation, which is on track to be commissioned and commence first production in Q4 2024. Notably, the Agreement means Limeco is producing positive operational cashflow even before the start of quicklime production in Q4 2024. An operational update on the substantial progress of the quicklime commission programme will be provided shortly.\nFurthermore, negotiations are ongoing with major copper producers for the sale of quicklime, while aggregate sales began in October 2023 with further offtake agreements expected as operations ramp up in the coming months.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION AS STIPULATED UNDER THE UK VERSION OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF ENGLISH LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months.

With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution.

In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

They've mentioned the bank loan a few times but then resorted to raises. We need that second kiln operating at a decent level and hopefully Firering can then secure the bank loan. \"with a return to target price of 1.25 inside 3 years (based on warrants)\" Can you elaborate? Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution.

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution.

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

And here we are, 1 Kiln that could run at 40t a day, taken offline and optimised, now doing 45t a day. The rest of the kilns?. Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

It's an asset and would be paid back before dividends with the benefit of avoiding tax. In simplistic terms, it's tax free dividends. Currently Firering have 30.7% of that asset, hopefully rising to 45% by July. Money in the bank for the January tranche, we have until 30th April to get the next payment together.

And here we are, 1 Kiln that could run at 40t a day, taken offline and optimised, now doing 45t a day. The rest of the kilns?. Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

They've mentioned the bank loan a few times but then resorted to raises. We need that second kiln operating at a decent level and hopefully Firering can then secure the bank loan. \"with a return to target price of 1.25 inside 3 years (based on warrants)\" Can you elaborate? Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

And here we are, 1 Kiln that could run at 40t a day, taken offline and optimised, now doing 45t a day. The rest of the kilns?. Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution.

Applying the learnings from Kiln 1 enables us to have a more predictable, repeatable ramp-up as we scale to a multi-kiln operation. Notably, each additional kiln brought into stable production, materially strengthens the business and expands its strategic optionality.\"\nDETAILS\nLimeco Operations\nLimeco has completed the hot commissioning of Kiln 2, during which saleable material was produced. As with the first kiln, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximate three-month optimisation period, during which operating parameters will be progressively refined to achieve consistent output with consistent quality and reliability. This optimisation phase is standard practice in the industry.\nKiln 2 incorporates the operational learnings from the ramp-up of Kiln 1, with targeted improvements to the burner system, airflow management, heat distribution and monitoring protocols, supporting a faster and more predictable path to steady-state production.\nEach additional kiln brought into stable operation materially strengthens operating leverage, cash generation potential and the overall resilience of the Project. In this context, the successful hot commissioning of Kiln 2 represents a further step in strengthening Firering's strategic and financing optionality as production capacity continues to increase.\nLimeco Sales and Customer Engagement\nCommercial momentum continues to build, with growing interest in Limeco's product range and encouraging developments across local and regional markets. Following a stringent validation process involving laboratory testing, bulk sampling, site inspections and trial orders, Limeco secured a 600t order from a major international mining group operating in Zambia. This order is currently being fulfilled, alongside a similar-sized order for material destined for clients in Zimbabwe. Engagements with additional prospective customers are ongoing, and Limeco is now well positioned to compete in tenders for longer-term supply contracts.\nLimeco Option Agreement\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (the \"Option\") (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has completed the exercise of the third tranche of the Option to acquire a further 5.5% interest in Limeco, taking its shareholding in Limeco to 36.2%.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an Africa-focused producer and developer of industrial and critical minerals. The Company's near-term focus is the ramp-up of production at the Limeco lime project in Zambia, where Firering holds a 36.2% interest with an option to increase this to 45%. Once fully optimised, Limeco is expected to be among the largest lime operations in the region, supplying major copper producers in the Central African Copperbelt and gold producers in Zimbabwe. Firering's portfolio also includes the highly prospective Atex Lithium-Tantalum Project in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

And here we are, 1 Kiln that could run at 40t a day, taken offline and optimised, now doing 45t a day. The rest of the kilns?. Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

They've mentioned the bank loan a few times but then resorted to raises.

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",

Well we know in September they were waiting for parts from India, for kiln 2, the rest? And this set up is new and fandangelled, and will increase production. So February was a sales pitch to get money in. The reality is one kiln works grossing $9-10k gross, the time and money spent on modernisation has never been clear, but now looks happless. How are they going to fund the final 2 tranches? We know the next one is taken care of, but then? Because they sure aren\u2019t making any money. The bank loan, $4m. How much revenue does it make to make at what margin makes this affordable? The $80k a year logistics profit, the net on the 34.5% share of revenue $3k a day gross. Or are they going to have to come back cap in hand for more? It\u2019s going to take a lot more than 1 kiln and a good sales pitch. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a change in leadership.",

The possibility of a placing to pay the January 2026 Limeco option has been dragging the share price down for some time. Now the finance for that is sorted, it means we have almost 6 months until the next Limeco option payment at the end of April. With kiln 1 operating at 55% and kiln 2 coming on line in December, then come the new year we'll be operating at a profit and generating a significant income stream ($5M per annum?) The original plan was a loan from a Zambian bank to cover the Limeco options ($2M outstanding) Surely this should now be approved given the consistent revenue being generated? I'm looking forward to an update on the kiln 2 progress, and then the activation of kilns 3 and 4 in the new year, at which point we could be generating around $10M per annum. Then the remaining 4 kilns can be activated and the concrete facility constructed.",

The final price depends on quantity, brand, and application. Processing cost: Hydrated lime is quicklime with water added, a processing step that adds to its cost. Density: Quicklime is more dense than hydrated lime. This means for the same volume, quicklime has a higher weight. For large purchases, this can make quicklime cheaper per tonne because there are lower transportation and storage costs. Application: The overall cost comparison also depends on the specific application. For example, hydrated lime is often sold in smaller bags for specific uses, while quicklime might be purchased in bulk for industrial purposes. Product availability: Quicklime is the raw material, while hydrated lime is a finished product that has been chemically altered, which also contributes to a higher per-unit price.",

Warrants look like a drop in the ocean. \"So a 2/5 dilution in the next 6 months. In effect the baseline price is 0.75.\" As far as I'm concerned, nothing will matter unless they get these kilns working nearer to their target values (80-100 tonnes/day). With the kilns operating and limeco able to start repaying the shareholders loan (~$45m assuming the last tranche goes through) the Mcap of \u00a34.4m is quite undervalued, dispite the potential for dilution. Your numbers seem to suggest that nothing is going to change apart from dilution. I'm all for hearing everyones opinions but I'd rather know how you came to them, that's where the meat is.",
