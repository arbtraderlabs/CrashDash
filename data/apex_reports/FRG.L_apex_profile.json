Applying the learnings from Kiln 1 enables us to have a more predictable, repeatable ramp-up as we scale to a multi-kiln operation. Notably, each additional kiln brought into stable production, materially strengthens the business and expands its strategic optionality.\"\nDETAILS\nLimeco Operations\nLimeco has completed the hot commissioning of Kiln 2, during which saleable material was produced. As with the first kiln, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximate three-month optimisation period, during which operating parameters will be progressively refined to achieve consistent output with consistent quality and reliability. This optimisation phase is standard practice in the industry.\nKiln 2 incorporates the operational learnings from the ramp-up of Kiln 1, with targeted improvements to the burner system, airflow management, heat distribution and monitoring protocols, supporting a faster and more predictable path to steady-state production.\nEach additional kiln brought into stable operation materially strengthens operating leverage, cash generation potential and the overall resilience of the Project. In this context, the successful hot commissioning of Kiln 2 represents a further step in strengthening Firering's strategic and financing optionality as production capacity continues to increase.\nLimeco Sales and Customer Engagement\nCommercial momentum continues to build, with growing interest in Limeco's product range and encouraging developments across local and regional markets. Following a stringent validation process involving laboratory testing, bulk sampling, site inspections and trial orders, Limeco secured a 600t order from a major international mining group operating in Zambia. This order is currently being fulfilled, alongside a similar-sized order for material destined for clients in Zimbabwe. Engagements with additional prospective customers are ongoing, and Limeco is now well positioned to compete in tenders for longer-term supply contracts.\nLimeco Option Agreement\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (the \"Option\") (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has completed the exercise of the third tranche of the Option to acquire a further 5.5% interest in Limeco, taking its shareholding in Limeco to 36.2%.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an Africa-focused producer and developer of industrial and critical minerals. The Company's near-term focus is the ramp-up of production at the Limeco lime project in Zambia, where Firering holds a 36.2% interest with an option to increase this to 45%. Once fully optimised, Limeco is expected to be among the largest lime operations in the region, supplying major copper producers in the Central African Copperbelt and gold producers in Zimbabwe. Firering's portfolio also includes the highly prospective Atex Lithium-Tantalum Project in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

With Yuval now focused entirely on leading Limeco on the ground, we are well positioned to optimise output, enhance operational performance and unlock meaningful shareholder value. I would like to thank Yuval for his significant time, commitment and contribution to the Board, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him as he drives Limeco forward.\"\nDETAILS\nOperations Update\nLimeco has commenced hot commissioning of Kiln 2 anticipated to take 10-14 days. Once commissioning is complete, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp up over an approximately three-month optimisation period. This represents an important milestone in increasing Limeco's production capacity and advancing the business toward steady-state production. Further updates will be provided as commissioning of Kiln 2 progresses and the optimisation phase advances.\nLimeco Option\nIn line with the Limeco Option Agreement (see RNS dated\n28 May\n2024)\n, Firering has notified the relevant parties of its intention to exercise the next tranche of the Option, which will increase its shareholding from 30.7 percent to 36.2 percent. The cash consideration to be paid amounts to US$981,667. This decision reflects the Board's continued confidence in Limeco as production ramps up.\nLimeco\nIn its most recent published accounts (financial year ended 31 December 2024), Limeco posted a loss before tax of ZMW 222,443,499 (US$8,496,696\u2020) on turnover of ZMW 26,296,833 (US$1,004,463\u2020). As at 31 December 2024, Limeco had net liabilities of ZMW 2,867,291,084 (US$102,844,013\u2021). Liabilities included ZMW 2,914,751,858 (US$104,546,336\u2021) due to shareholders (\"Shareholders Loan\"). Following the exercise of the third tranche of the Option, Firering increases its right to 36.2% (cUS$28.1m\u2021) of the Shareholders Loan.\nNotes\n* the Option was described as the \"New Option\" in the Company's notification of 28 May 2024 which sets out detail of the Share Purchase Agreement and Option arrangements\n\u2020 at the exchange rate of Zambian Kwacha (ZMW) 26.18 : $1\n\u2021 at the exchange rate of ZMW 27.88 : $1\nDirectorship Change\nAs Limeco continues to represent the Company's primary value driver, Mr Yuval Cohen has stepped down with immediate effect from his roles as CEO and Director of Firering to focus exclusively on his position as CEO of Limeco. Yuval has been closely involved in Limeco's development to date, and his full-time focus is expected to strengthen operational execution and accelerate the business's commercial progress. Youval Rasin, Firering's Chairman, has been appointed as Interim CEO of Firering whilst a permanent replacement in sought.\nENDS\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals.

At Limeco, the cold commissioning of our second kiln marks an important step towards scaling production, while growing customer engagement, and the acceleration of new potential revenue streams underline the strength of demand for our lime products. In parallel, improving lithium market dynamics are drawing renewed third-party interest in Atex and Alliance, highlighting the strategic value embedded in our wider portfolio.\"\nLimeco Operations\nLimeco continues to make good operational progress as it advances towards higher output from its integrated limestone mining and processing operation.\nFollowing on from connecting Kiln 2 to the feed system and gasifier, cold commissioning has commenced, with hot commissioning and optimisation to follow. Once commissioned, production from Kiln 2 is expected to ramp during a three month optimisation period. The final container with equipment for Kilns 3 and 4 is now on site, allowing the Company to move quickly into modifying these kilns once Kiln 2 is optimised and operating.\nKiln 1 remains operational, and over recent months Limeco has built up an inventory of approximately 5,000 tonnes of finished product, providing near-term supply flexibility as production scales.\nIn addition, Limeco is fast-tracking the installation of a high-purity calcium carbonate milling circuit (exceeding 95 percent CaCO\u2083). This will create a new revenue stream with applications across construction materials, industrial products and environmental uses. Commissioning of the milling circuit is currently expected in Q3 2026.\nLimeco Sales and Customer Engagement\nCommercial momentum continues to build, with a growing pipeline of sales discussions progressing through the typical three-month qualification process, including laboratory testing, bulk sampling, site inspections and trial orders.\nNotably, Limeco recently hosted a site visit from a major international mining group operating in Zambia, the country's largest copper and cobalt producer. Discussions focused on Limeco's production capabilities and the potential supply of hydrated lime, reflecting increasing demand from large-scale mining operators for reliable, high-performance lime products critical to their operations.\nAtex and Alliance Portfolio Assets\nFollowing the announcement of 19 August 2025 and subsequent confirmation of full and final settlement (as detailed in the announcements of 12 November 2025, 19 November 2025 and 24 December 2025), Firering now holds a 90 percent interest in Atex and a 51 percent interest in Alliance, both lithium-tantalum projects located in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. These assets are fully unencumbered.\nThe Board continues to monitor improving lithium market conditions, which it believes are increasingly highlighting the compelling value fundamentals of both projects. In this context, Firering has received third-party interest in Atex and Alliance, reinforcing their underlying value within the Company's portfolio.\n*** ENDS ***\nFor further information visit www.fireringplc.com or contact:\nFirering Strategic Minerals\nVassilios Carellas\nE: info@firering-holdings.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\nT: +44 20 3368 3550\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Erik Woolgar\nT: +44 20 7186 9950\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis / Susie Geliher / Seb Weller\nE:\u00a0firering@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nFirering Strategic Minerals plc (AIM: FRG) is an emerging producer of quicklime and explorer of critical minerals. The Company is currently focused on ramping up production at the Limeco lime project in Zambia, in which it holds a 30.7% interest with an option to increase this to 45%. Targeting daily output of 600-800 tonnes, Limeco is well positioned to supply copper producers operating within the Central African Copperbelt and gold producers operating in Zimbabwe. Additionally, Firering is progressing the Atex Lithium-Tantalum Project in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a highly prospective asset with significant lithium and tantalum-niobium potential, supporting the global shift to clean energy technologies.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
