This marks a significant milestone for the Company, following processing US$4.8 million in December 2025. As announced on 5 January 2026, the growth of Vortex has been largely driven by the onboarding of new API clients, reflecting strong adoption of SatoshiPay's payment infrastructure. Vortex has now processed approximately US$20 million in total cumulative transactions.\nVortex continues to expand its geographical reach and is planning on expanding into the United States through a multi-currency partnership with Alfredpay which\nis intended to serve as a cornerstone for the North American operations of Vortex\n.\nThe technical integration phase of this partnership is\ncurrently in the development and sandbox testing stage. Once finalized, the partnership aims to leverage Alfredpay's infrastructure to enable broader access to stablecoin-powered payment solutions, significantly enhancing Vortex's geographical reach and cross-border capabilities.\nThe Vortex platform continues to expand its reach within the stablecoin sector, which recorded over US$8 trillion in transfer volumes on Ethereum in Q4 2025. To capitalise on this trend, Vortex has recently listed over 250 new crypto tokens, transforming its platform into a robust lead generation and fiat access gateway for global Web3 communities.\nIn addition, Vortex has been inducted into the Circle Alliance Partner Programme, aligning SatoshiPay with Circle, the issuer of USDC. This collaboration reinforces SatoshiPay's commitment to transparency, compliance, and liquidity, positioning Vortex within a global network of DeFi operators.\nPendulum Update\nDuring January 2026, PEN, the native token of Pendulum, a decentralized organization co-founded by SatoshiPay, achieved key milestones across both centralised and decentralised markets. As of 26 January 2026, the PEN token transitioned to the Innovation Zone on MEXC, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, following a rigorous platform evaluation and demonstrating compliance with liquidity and order book depth requirements.\nIn the decentralised ecosystem, PEN has secured the top ranking in the Isolated Pool section on Hydration, Polkadot's leading decentralised exchange. Furthermore, PEN has now become the official access token for the Vortex platform, with a portion of platform fees processed in PEN. As a result, every transaction on Vortex generates demand for the token, linking platform growth with token utility. SatoshiPay currently owns approximately 12 per cent of the total supply of PEN tokens.\nSatoshiPay Update\nAdditionally, the Company notes that SatoshiPay has made available on its website a presentation that outlines SatoshiPay's recent growth and its management's expectations regarding future prospect. The presentation can be found at\nhttps://www.satoshipay.io/\n.\nThe Company notes that the presentation includes a valuation analysis completed by SatoshiPay. The figures in the presentation are derived from internal company research, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties, and have not undergone an independent valuation.\nOutlook\nThe Board is encouraged by SatoshiPay's operational progress and the momentum achieved across its key growth initiatives. With the continued integration of API partners and the expansion into the United States underway, SatoshiPay is well positioned to deliver further growth in H1 2026.\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

Valuations have been prepared using spot crypto prices as of 30 December 2025, with inputs of BTC EUR74,583.38, ETH EUR2,528.49 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.17732, as per the table below:\nDigital Asset\nCode\nPrincipal Quantity\nSpot Price\n(EUR)\nTotal Value\n(EUR)\nPerformance since inception\n(27/08/25)\nBitcoin\nBTC\n9.27\n74,583.38\n691,188.03\n-24.74%\nEthereum\nETH\n72.03\n2,528.49\n182,135.62\n-20.69%\nGross Total\n873,323.65\nAggregate\nPerformance\n-23.93%\nYield and Fees\nDespite the reduction in the portfolio's spot valuation driven by movements in BTC and ETH prices, the Treasury has generated positive yield over the period. This yield includes returns generated from decentralised finance liquidity provisioning, including activity associated with Vortex. Since inception, the Treasury has had an unrealised yield of USD11,275 and a realised and withdrawn yield of USD75,297, equating to an average annualised APR of 18.01% calculated on a simple basis from realised yield since 27 August 2025.\nT\nhe gross portfolio value of the Treasury is EUR882,934.04 and excluding accrued unrealised yield is EUR873,323.65.\nThe Company is encouraged by the Treasury's yield generation to date. SatoshiPay remains focused on monitoring both portfolio valuation and yield generation and views the Treasury management as an important part of its strategy to optimise returns from digital assets.\nAPR figures are calculated on a simple annualised basis from realised yield over the period since inception.\nThe Company intends to announce the performance of SatoshiPay's Treasury on a quarterly basis, with the next period ending 30 March 2026.\nVortex Update\nFurther to the announcement on 11 November 2025, Vortex, SatoshiPay's fiat-to-crypto infrastructure platform processed over US$4.8 million in transaction volumes for the month of December 2025, representing a month on month increase of over 52%. Since its launch, Vortex has now processed over US$9.9 million in cumulative transaction volumes.\nThe Board of the Company is encouraged by Vortex's performance since its inception, including its recent API partner onboarding, and will continue to update the market with further developments.\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nDirector Remuneration and Grant of Warrants\nAdditionally, the Company announces that, in order to preserve cash for deployment within the business, it has agreed to pay the Directors a reduced salary and has granted the Directors warrants over ordinary shares in the Company (\"\nWarrants\n\") as partial remuneration in lieu of salary. The Directors have not received any salary in respect of their roles since January 2024 in order to maximise available cash for the Company's portfolio of investments.\nThe Warrants have been granted as follows:\nWarrant Holder\nNumber of Warrants Granted\nExercise Price (\u00a3)\nWarrants granted as a percentage of issued share capital\nAnthony Fabrizi\n700,000\n0.11\n1.47%\nMeinhard Benn\n350,000\n0.11\n0.74%\nSean King\n175,000\n0.11\n0.37%\nThe Warrants have an exercise period of 2 years and the exercise price of \u00a30.11, representing a premium to the closing mid-market price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on 31 December 2025 of approximately 22 per cent.

Conversion of the SAFE funding into equity will only occur in the event of satisfying its predefined conditions, including but not limited to; a future funding round,\na change of control, or an IPO, as outlined in the SAFE agreement.\nThe SAFE funding was completed at a post money valuation cap of EUR3.5 million, which sets the maximum price at which the SAFE funding converts.\nT\nhe true valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the conversion will depend on the terms of any future equity funding round.\nThe SAFE fundraise will provide SatoshiPay with sufficient working capital ahead of a further anticipated Series A fundraising for SatoshiPay in first half of 2026.\nSatoshiPay will use the funds to accelerate its South American market expansion and broaden blockchain integrations across key networks including Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, strengthening its multi-chain and interoperability capabilities.\nExisting clients, already transacting substantial volumes through Vortex, requested an API to automate their flows and increase frequency. SatoshiPay has now launched this API and an automated pool-rebalancing system, enabling these partners to scale activity significantly.\nIn parallel, Vortex is in\nadvanced discussions regarding\nintegrating with a leading global crypto\n-\nfiat gateway aggregator\n,\nconnecting to over 50 wallets and exchanges, including MetaMask, Phantom and Paybis\n, which may\nopen access to a broad, high-margin customer base and further expand Vortex's commercial reach.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course.\nSubject to the SAFE being fully converted at the point of a future funding round Blue Star's shareholding will change but the extent of this change will be dependent on the amount raised and the valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the SAFE conversion.\nUntil such a conversion takes place, Blue Star's current shareholding of approximately 50 per cent. remains unchanged.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman said\n\"\nWe are pleased with ongoing progress at SatoshiPay and keen to support their growth plans with our latest funding support through the SAFE structure.

Valuations have been prepared using spot crypto prices as of 30 December 2025, with inputs of BTC EUR74,583.38, ETH EUR2,528.49 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.17732, as per the table below:\nDigital Asset\nCode\nPrincipal Quantity\nSpot Price\n(EUR)\nTotal Value\n(EUR)\nPerformance since inception\n(27/08/25)\nBitcoin\nBTC\n9.27\n74,583.38\n691,188.03\n-24.74%\nEthereum\nETH\n72.03\n2,528.49\n182,135.62\n-20.69%\nGross Total\n873,323.65\nAggregate\nPerformance\n-23.93%\nYield and Fees\nDespite the reduction in the portfolio's spot valuation driven by movements in BTC and ETH prices, the Treasury has generated positive yield over the period. This yield includes returns generated from decentralised finance liquidity provisioning, including activity associated with Vortex. Since inception, the Treasury has had an unrealised yield of USD11,275 and a realised and withdrawn yield of USD75,297, equating to an average annualised APR of 18.01% calculated on a simple basis from realised yield since 27 August 2025.\nT\nhe gross portfolio value of the Treasury is EUR882,934.04 and excluding accrued unrealised yield is EUR873,323.65.\nThe Company is encouraged by the Treasury's yield generation to date. SatoshiPay remains focused on monitoring both portfolio valuation and yield generation and views the Treasury management as an important part of its strategy to optimise returns from digital assets.\nAPR figures are calculated on a simple annualised basis from realised yield over the period since inception.\nThe Company intends to announce the performance of SatoshiPay's Treasury on a quarterly basis, with the next period ending 30 March 2026.\nVortex Update\nFurther to the announcement on 11 November 2025, Vortex, SatoshiPay's fiat-to-crypto infrastructure platform processed over US$4.8 million in transaction volumes for the month of December 2025, representing a month on month increase of over 52%. Since its launch, Vortex has now processed over US$9.9 million in cumulative transaction volumes.\nThe Board of the Company is encouraged by Vortex's performance since its inception, including its recent API partner onboarding, and will continue to update the market with further developments.\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nDirector Remuneration and Grant of Warrants\nAdditionally, the Company announces that, in order to preserve cash for deployment within the business, it has agreed to pay the Directors a reduced salary and has granted the Directors warrants over ordinary shares in the Company (\"\nWarrants\n\") as partial remuneration in lieu of salary. The Directors have not received any salary in respect of their roles since January 2024 in order to maximise available cash for the Company's portfolio of investments.\nThe Warrants have been granted as follows:\nWarrant Holder\nNumber of Warrants Granted\nExercise Price (\u00a3)\nWarrants granted as a percentage of issued share capital\nAnthony Fabrizi\n700,000\n0.11\n1.47%\nMeinhard Benn\n350,000\n0.11\n0.74%\nSean King\n175,000\n0.11\n0.37%\nThe Warrants have an exercise period of 2 years and the exercise price of \u00a30.11, representing a premium to the closing mid-market price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on 31 December 2025 of approximately 22 per cent. The Warrants are not subject to any other performance criteria.\nThe current issued share capital of the Company comprises 47,553,234 Ordinary Shares.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

Conversion of the SAFE funding into equity will only occur in the event of satisfying its predefined conditions, including but not limited to; a future funding round,\na change of control, or an IPO, as outlined in the SAFE agreement.\nThe SAFE funding was completed at a post money valuation cap of EUR3.5 million, which sets the maximum price at which the SAFE funding converts.\nT\nhe true valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the conversion will depend on the terms of any future equity funding round.\nThe SAFE fundraise will provide SatoshiPay with sufficient working capital ahead of a further anticipated Series A fundraising for SatoshiPay in first half of 2026.\nSatoshiPay will use the funds to accelerate its South American market expansion and broaden blockchain integrations across key networks including Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, strengthening its multi-chain and interoperability capabilities.\nExisting clients, already transacting substantial volumes through Vortex, requested an API to automate their flows and increase frequency. SatoshiPay has now launched this API and an automated pool-rebalancing system, enabling these partners to scale activity significantly.\nIn parallel, Vortex is in\nadvanced discussions regarding\nintegrating with a leading global crypto\n-\nfiat gateway aggregator\n,\nconnecting to over 50 wallets and exchanges, including MetaMask, Phantom and Paybis\n, which may\nopen access to a broad, high-margin customer base and further expand Vortex's commercial reach.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course.\nSubject to the SAFE being fully converted at the point of a future funding round Blue Star's shareholding will change but the extent of this change will be dependent on the amount raised and the valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the SAFE conversion.\nUntil such a conversion takes place, Blue Star's current shareholding of approximately 50 per cent. remains unchanged.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman said\n\"\nWe are pleased with ongoing progress at SatoshiPay and keen to support their growth plans with our latest funding support through the SAFE structure. The recent improvements in the Vortex platform lays the foundations for significant future growth and we look forward to updating the market with their progress during the remainder of the year.\n\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.

The updates include partitioning the platform services into quote and widget pages, enhanced focus on the widget interactions for business clients, and defining a clear on- and off-ramp service.\nThe new version of the Vortex widget additionally provides users with a new chain-agnostic token selection dialogue, utilises a state machine in the front\nend to create a robust platform UX, and allows complete compatibility with the upcoming Version 2 API interface launched by Avenia, Vortex's partner in Brazil. As a result of the upgrade, the Vortex platform and its services have been halted in Brazil, ahead of the anticipated launch which is expected to be within the next week. Vortex will continue to support partners and clients through this upgrade and will provide updates in due course.\nSatoshiPay is continually seeking complementary commercial partnerships to its Vortex project and is in talks with several payment service providers (PSPs), wallet developers, and on/off ramp aggregators, which would assist in routing retail flow from frontend platforms to Vortex automatically, without requiring separate integrations. Further details on these partnerships will be announced in due course.\nAdditional SatoshiPay Project Updates\nFurther to the announcement of 2 July 2025, noting the expansion of SatoshiPay's Digital Asset Treasury Policy, the Company announces that on 17 September 2025, SatoshiPay successfully deployed an initial liquidity of US$20,000 to Vortex DEX on Pendulum, a project incubated by SatoshiPay that provides decentralised blockchain technology for modernising traditional financial infrastructure.\nFurther to the above, SatoshiPay has received over US$20,000 from an initial DeFi yield, via the deployment of its treasury in DeFi protocols, including Nabla.fi (\"\nNabla\n\"), a project incubated by SatoshiPay focused on providing a next-generation decentralised exchange designed to optimise swap rates and liquidity provisioning.\nNabla announced on 15 September 2025 that it secured a strategic investment from German Heliad Crypto Partners and Blue Star Capital director, Meinhard Benn's personal investment fund, Solarpunk. Nabla has processed over US$100 million in volume through its DeFi protocol to date. Proceeds of the token sale will be used to fund the protocol's multi-blockchain expansion.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman of Blue Star said,\n\"\nToday's announcement demonstrates the ongoing progress being made by SatoshiPay and its portfolio businesses. In particular, the improved platform and infrastructure should allow Vortex to deliver strong growth over the remainder of 2025\n\".\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nSatoshiPay currently owns 1.9 million Nabla tokens, and owns a further 50 million locked tokens, that vest from 9 November 2026, until 9 November 2028. The current price of Nabla tokens is US$0.003255 per $nabla token.\nThe Directors of the Company take responsibility for this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.

Wrapped assets, like cbBTC, are transferable tokens that are redeemable for the underlying asset. Coinbase customers can unwrap cbBTC and redeem a corresponding amount of the underlying BTC simply by depositing the cbBTC into their Coinbase accounts. cbBTC is built to be seamlessly compatible with decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, giving customers the option to tap into DeFi and unlock financial utility.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman of Blue Star said \"\nAs previously announced the treasury operations of SatoshiPay are intended to provide a dual benefit of holding digital assets and also providing a framework for SatoshiPay to build additional liquidity behind Vortex through DeFi applications.

Blue Star will retain the full benefit of any increase in value of the portfolio and by providing the Loan, as the largest shareholder, Blue Star will benefit from the growth of SatoshiPay whilst maintaining security over the funds lent via a lien granted against any crypto assets purchased.\nThe Company will provide further information to the market once these funds have been fully invested by SatoshiPay.\nSecond Web3 Grant Milestone Achieved\nFurther to the above, Vortex, a decentralised exchange platform incubated by SatoshiPay designed to streamline global payments by bridging stablecoins with local fiat currencies, has now met the second set of milestones set out under the grant structure with Web3, a foundation developed to promote emerging decentralized web software protocols, technologies, and applications. These milestones included:\n\u25cf\nLaunching Vortex in key markets, such as Brazil; and\n\u25cf\nEstablishing a Polkadot offramp via Pendulum's Spacewalk bridge to enable USDC-to-fiat swaps.\nAs a result, SatoshiPay expects to receive the next tranche of non-dilutive grant funding of approximately US$130,000 in the near future.\nFollowing Vortex achieving the second set of milestones within its anticipated timeline\n, SatoshiPay remains well positioned to advance its product roadmap and continue scaling Vortex into target markets.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman of Blue Star said,\n\"\nWe are delighted that SatoshiPay and Blue Star have completed all necessary legal and corporate structural arrangements to allow SatoshiPay to drawdown the Loan and expand its digital asset treasury operations.\n\"These funds together with those provided via the recent Web3 grant put SatoshiPay in an excellent position to build Vortex so it can gain increased market traction.\"\nThe Company currently has a 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

This capital raise was undertaken by the Company's corporate broker Axis Capital Markets Limited.\nBackground to the Fundraise and Use of Proceeds\nIn the announcement on 26 June 2025, the Company reiterated its confidence in SatoshiPay's technology and announced that it had increased its shareholding in SatoshiPay Ltd (\"\nSatoshiPay\n\"), via an acquisition of existing shares, making it the largest shareholder with an interest of approximately 50.0%. Further, Blue Star advised that it would seek ways to provide additional liquidity to Vortex, SatoshiPay's subsidiary, by helping it expand,\ninter alia\n, its digital asset treasury function.\nAccordingly, a minimum of \u00a31,000,000 of the Fundraise will be used to invest into SatoshiPay by way of a secured loan (the \"\nLoan\n\") for SatoshiPay to increase its existing digital asset treasury function including Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Although Blue Star will not directly hold any crypto assets, in consideration for the Loan, upon repayment, Blue Star will receive payment of the equivalent value of any capital increase in the value of the portfolio. In addition to the benefits of the Loan to Vortex's business summarised below, SatoshiPay will additionally benefit from any yield generated from the portfolio of assets.\nThe board of SatoshiPay advises that the enlarged treasury function will strengthen Vortex's core offering through aspects such as supporting stable swap pricing through deepening liquidity and deploying assets in secured DeFi protocols, which can also be used in pools on Pendulum, the DeFi blockchain that serves as Vortex's foreign exchange backend. It is expected that this will allow Vortex to accelerate its market expansion as new pools can be activated, allowing Vortex to enter new markets as liquidity can be put in place. Further, the additional liquidity supports increased yield generation activities at the fund level as fees and farming rewards can be generated through the provision of liquidity.\nBefore any funds are lent to SatoshiPay, Blue Star and SatoshiPay will enter into a loan agreement whereby the Loan will be secured against the value of the treasury assets and Blue Star will retain of the full benefit of any increase in value of the portfolio. By providing the Loan, as the largest shareholder, Blue Star will also benefit from the growth of SatoshiPay whilst maintaining security over the funds lent with lien granted against the crypto assets purchased.\nThe Company may use the some of the proceeds to support existing companies in the Blue Star's portfolio of investments and for general working capital purposes.\nBroker Option\nFurther to the Fundraise, the Company and Axis Capital Market Limited (\"\nAxis\n\") have agreed to launch a broker option to raise up to a further \u00a3100,000 for the Company through the issue of up to 555,556 new ordinary shares (\"\nBroker Option Shares\n\") at the Issue Price (\"\nBroker Option\n\") in order to provide eligible existing shareholders the ability to participate in the Fundraise, in the event they have not had the opportunity to do so.\nThe Broker Option is only available to existing shareholders on the register as at the close of business on 1 July 2025 (\"\nExisting Shareholders\n\") and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be made available to the public or in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful to do so. Existing Shareholders wishing to subscribe for Broker Option Shares will need to prove that they are shareholders at the time of the instruction from their existing broker to Axis.\nExpressions of interest to participate in the Broker Option must be received no later than 4.30 p.m. on 2 July 2025 (\"\nClosing Date\n\") with funds being made available shortly after. In the event any Existing Shareholders subscribe for additional new ordinary shares pursuant to the Broker Option, a further announcement will be made following the Closing Date with details of further subscription. In the event that the Broker Option Shares are not fully subscribed for, Axis will have the right to place the balance of the shares. In the event the Broker Option is oversubscribed, the Company and its broker may scale down any subscriptions received and may accept offers for subscription in the order in which they are received. Application for admission to trading on AIM for the Broker Option Shares will only occur following receipt of subscription proceeds. In the event proceeds for the Broker Option shares are not received by 8 Ju",

As a result, the Company has increased its holding in SatoshiPay to approximately 50.0%.\nDetails of the Acquisition\nAs previously announced, the Board of Blue Star maintains its confidence in SatoshiPay's technology, which connects the fiat financial system to the DeFi ecosystem. Additionally, the Company announced its intention to explore investments into areas such as the establishment of a digital asset treasury function. This form of treasury management is an integral part in the development and promotion of Vortex's business model. The Company will continue to explore ways to provide additional liquidity to Vortex through SatoshiPay expanding its existing digital asset treasury function.\nPursuant to the terms of the Acquisition, the Company has agreed to acquire, in aggregate, approximately 4,500 shares in SatoshiPay, representing approximately 22.0% of SatoshiPay's issued share capital in consideration for the issue of 4,412,096 new Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.001 each in the Company (\"\nAcquisition Shares\n\") at a price of 20 pence per new Ordinary Share (\"\nIssue Price\n\") (the \"\nAgreements\n\"). As a result of the Acquisition, the Company will become the largest shareholder in SatoshiPay. Following completion of the Acquisition, Meinhard Benn will hold approximately 25.0% of SatoshiPay and will hold 5,946,846 shares in the Company representing approximately 15.0% of the Company's enlarged issued share capital following admission of the Acquisition Shares.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nIn order for the share transfers to be effected, application has been made for the Acquisition Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on or around 9 July 2025.\nOn Admission, the Enlarged Issued Share Capital of the Company will be 40,498,688 ordinary shares, with no shares held in Treasury. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company following Admission will be 40,498,688 and this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe acquisition of shares in SatoshiPay from Meinhard Benn via the issue of Ordinary Shares in the Company constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules, as a consequence of Meinhard Benn being a director of the Company and of SatoshiPay. The Directors of the Company independent of the related party transaction, being Anthony Fabrizi and Sean King, consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Cairn Financial Advisers LLP, that the terms of the related party transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as its Shareholders are concerned.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

Following that process, the Company raised \u00a3150,000 which allowed it to invest \u20ac75,000 into SatoshiPay's \u20ac400,000 SAFE fund raise which completed in February 2025.\n\u00b7\nPost period end, Meinhard Benn, founder of SatoshiPay joined the Board as a non-executive director in May 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Company also successfully raised \u00a3250,000 in June 2025 to provide it with additional working capital and sufficient funds to support the next funding round, anticipated by SatoshiPay in the third quarter of 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\nAnthony Fabrizi\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nNominated Adviser\nJo Turner / Liam Murray\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nSole Broker\nLewis Jones\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\nAbout Blue Start Capital\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies. Blue Star's investments include SatoshiPay Limited, an experienced blockchain company with a strong track record in innovative payment solutions; Dynasty Media & Gaming, whose B2B white label platform is a full-stack gaming ecosystem; Paidia, a female focused gaming platform; and Sthaler Limited, an identity and payments technology business which enables a consumer to identify themselves and pay using just their finger.\nChairman's Statement\nI am pleased to report that the Company has made encouraging progress since the start of 2025. At the end of 2024 the Company carried out a capital reorganisation, via a 200:1 consolidation of the shares of the Company. The capital reorganisation was necessary as the Company's share price was trading below its nominal value, which prohibited the Company from raising new money by issuing shares for cash. Contemporaneously with the reorganisation, the Company raised \u00a3150,000 via a subscription, in January 2025, in order to provide necessary working capital and to allow Blue Star to participate in SatoshiPay's SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) fundraise in February 2025 which raised EUR400,000, of which BLU invested \u20ac75,000. In addition, as part of the reorganisation proposals the Board agreed to waive any right to cash fees until 31 December 2025 in exchange for warrants in the Company and as a result of this decision and other cost savings, the Company's annualised cash running costs have now been reduced to around \u00a3100,000 per annum. As covered in more detail below, Vortex, which is being incubated by SatoshiPay, is showing significant potential. Furthermore, sentiment towards blockchain and crypto investments is growing strongly, in particular, crypto treasury functions are attracting significant investor interest. The Board believes its relationship with SatoshiPay places it in an interesting position to examine such opportunities.\nIn terms of the Company's results for the first half of the year, these show little change from the year end position with all valuations of the Company's investments remaining unaltered, apart from exchange rate movements. As announced yesterday, the Company successfully closed a fundraise of \u00a3250,000 before expenses which places it in a much stronger financial position moving forward.\nBelow we provide the following portfolio company highlights for the six-month period ended 31 March 2025 and events in the period to 20 June 2025.\nSatoshiPay\nSatoshiPay's strategy is to build a network of projects across the\u00a0decentralised finance space\u00a0with the ultimate goal of advancing foreign exchange (\"\nForex\n\") trading into the blockchain space. SatoshiPay's is currently primarily focused on building out its Vortex platform which is showing strong growth.\nVortex is a decentralised exchange platform, designed to enhance global payments by bridging stablecoins with local fiat currencies. The Vortex platform enables users to seamlessly swap stablecoins for local fiat currencies at significantly lower costs than current market rates. This presents a substantial opportunity in a rapidly growing market, with cross-border stablecoin payments valued at US$27 billion in 2023 and projected to reach US$137 billion by 2028. This growth highlights a US$14 billion volume in the on/off-ramp market opportunity over the next four years.\nVortex's business model is built around enabling easy to complete cur",

The full Circular, together with supporting documents, will be available from the Company's website,\nhttps://bluestarcapital.co.uk/\nlater today.\nCapitalised terms in this announcement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Definitions section of the Circular.\nBackground to and reasons for the Conditional Fundraise\nThe Company has been involved in investments in and around the blockchain payments industry for almost a decade. The Company's principal investment is in SatoshiPay Ltd, in which it holds an interest of 27.9 per cent. The Board maintains its confidence in SatoshiPay's technology which connects the fiat financial system to the DeFi ecosystem. Importantly, the Company is encouraged to see the surge in demand and applications for digital currency and for companies holding or using more established cryptocurrencies such and Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nIn January 2025, the Company announced that it had completed a capital reorganisation and a fundraise of \u00a3150,000 via a subscription for 7,500,000 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 each. In a circular posted to shareholders, the Company set out that the proceeds of the fundraise would be used to participate in a follow-on funding round for SatoshiPay in addition to providing the Company with funds for working capital. In February 2025, the Company invested EUR75,000 into SatoshiPay's EUR400,000 SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) fundraise. The Company continues to carefully manage its cash resources and working capital position and has been cautious in light of its ongoing operational requirements and the broader market environment for small cap companies. The intention of the Company was to raise smaller amounts, with lower dilution, with the view to raising further funding later at higher share prices.\nMore recently, SatoshiPay announced that Vortex, a wholly owned decentralised exchange platform incubated by SatoshiPay, had achieved $1 million in transaction volumes since launching in Europe and Brazil with $507,000 of the total achieved in May 2025. Meinhard Benn, founder of SatoshiPay, recently joined the Board as a non-executive director bringing with him considerable direct experience and knowledge of the blockchain, crypto, payments and defi sectors.\nFollowing recent announcements related to the progress made at Vortex, the Board wishes to strengthen the Company's financial position to provide it with capital reserves to,\ninter alia\n, enable it to further support and invest into SatoshiPay's growth. As such, the Company is proposing to undertake the Fundraise to raise \u00a3250,000. This capital injection will provide the Company with investments funds to further support SatoshiPay's growth and better m",

The main factor behind this year's significant loss was the write down in value of the Company's investment in SatoshiPay from \u00a34,653,099 to \u00a3581,068. Blue Star currently has a 27.9% interest in SatoshiPay's share capital. This shareholding has historically been valued in accordance with the Company's long-standing accounting policy, which is to use the last external fund raise. This last took place in 2019 and on this basis the shareholding was valued in last year's accounts at \u00a34,653,099.\nSince the middle of 2024, SatoshiPay has focused its attention on a newly incubated project called Vortex. The Vortex platform will enable users to seamlessly swap stablecoins for local fiat currencies at significantly lower costs than current market rates. This presents a substantial opportunity in a rapidly growing market.\nIn order to exploit the opportunity presented by Vortex, SatoshiPay completed a \u20ac400,000 fundraise on 25 February 2025, through a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) funding round marketed to existing investors in SatoshiPay. Blue Star subscribed for \u20ac75,000 in the SAFE funding round.\nWhile not an equity raise in the traditional sense, the SAFE terms did put a cap on the value at which the SAFE funds could be converted of \u20ac2.5 million. While the SAFE fundraise does not directly establish a new valuation for SatoshiPay, the Board believed that the most prudent accounting approach was to use the valuation cap as a reference point for financial reporting purposes. This approach is conservative. The true valuation of SatoshiPay will only be determined at the time of a future equity round. It was for this reason that Blue Star felt it important to participate in the round contributing 18.75% of the SAFE raise, ensuring only modest future dilution from our current percentage which remains unchanged at current shareholding of 27.9%.\nThe Company's esports investments made strong commercial progress during the last year with both expected to become cashflow positive during 2025.\nThe operating expenses of the Company continue to be reduced and declined by 24% last year.\nThe cash position of the Company at 30 September 2024 was \u00a35,828 compared with \u00a363,158 in the previous period. Post year end, the Company raised gross proceeds of \u00a3150,000 from the issue of new ordinary shares to provide additional working capital and to enable it to participate in the SAFE fund raise undertaken by SatoshiPay.\nThe Annual Report and notice of Annual General Meeting (\"\nAGM\n\") will be posted to shareholders shortly and will be available to view on the Company's website\nhttp://www.bluestarcapital.co.uk\nThe AGM will be held at the offices of Cairn Financial Advisers LLP, 80 Cheapside, 3rd Floor, EC2V 6EE on Wednesday 25 April 2025 at 10:00 a.m. Shareholders wishing to vote on any matters of business at the AGM are encouraged to do so through completion of a proxy form which can be completed and submitted to the Company. Proxies should be completed and returned in accordance with the instructions on the form of proxy by no later than 10:00 a.m. on 23 April 2025.\nTony Fabrizi Executive Chairman of Blue Star Capital plc, commented:\n\"\nBlue Star's future remains closely aligned with performance of SatoshiPay and its Vortex project, which it owns 100%. Vortex's recent launch in Brazil should provide invaluable feedback on the attractiveness of the product offering and SatoshiPay's ability to attract ongoing investment. While we await future developments with SatoshiPay, we will continue to support our other investee business wherever possible, and to carefully manage the limited cash resources of the Company.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.

          "full_content": "25 Feb 2025 14:00\nRNS Number : 4161Y\nBlue Star Capital plc\n25 February 2025\n25 February 2025\nBlue Star Capital plc\n(\"Blue Star\" or the \"Company\")\nSatoshiPay Update\nBlue Star Capital plc (AIM: BLU), the investing company with a focus on blockchain, esports and payments, announces that its investee company, SatoshiPay Ltd (\"\nSatoshiPay\n\"), has completed a EUR400,000 fundraise, through a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) funding round marketed to existing investors in SatoshiPay. Blue Star subscribed for EUR75,000 in the SAFE funding round, in line with its intentions announced on 17 December 2024.\nA SAFE funding round does not immediately issue equity or change the shareholding structure of SatoshiPay. Conversion of the SAFE funding into equity will only occur in the event of satisfying its predefined conditions, including but not limited to; a future funding round,\na change of control, or an IPO, as outlined in the SAFE agreement.\nThe SAFE funding was completed at a valuation cap of EUR2.5 million, which sets the maximum price at which the SAFE funding converts, representing a significant discount compared to SatoshiPay's last equity funding round in February 2019\n. The true valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the conversion will depend on the terms of any future equity funding round.\nIn addition to Blue Star, the other key investors that participated in the SAFE funding were Meinhard Benn, founder and Chairman of SatoshiPay and Daniel Masters, Non-Executive Director of SatoshiPay and Chairman of CoinShares Limited, both investing in a personal capacity. The SAFE fundraise, in conjunction with the grant awarded by the Web3 Foundation for approximately US$460,000 announced 18 February 2025, will provide SatoshiPay with sufficient working capital ahead of a further anticipated Series A fundraising for SatoshiPay in 2025.\nThe Company recognises that the SAFE fundraise is a positive step for SatoshiPay and will support the development of its ongoing DeFi initiatives, in particular Vortex, a decentralised exchange platform incubated by SatoshiPay, designed to enhance global payments by bridging stablecoins with local fiat currencies. Vortex is built on Pendulum, an open, decentralised blockchain optimised for connecting DeFi with real-world forex markets and powered by the PEN token.\nSatoshiPay intends to deploy the funds raised to assist market roll outs in Europe and South America and expand blockchain integrations, which includes deployments on networks such as Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot, fostering interoperability across major ecosystems.\nSubject to the SAFE being fully converted at the point of a future funding round, Blue Star's shareholding in SatoshiPay is expected to decrease. However, the extent of this change in shareholding is dependent on the amount raised and the valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the SAFE conversion. Until such a conversion takes place, Blue Star's current shareholding of 27.9 per cent remains unchanged\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman of Blue Star said: \"\nThis financing confirms SatoshiPay's strategic transition from developing a Layer 1 blockchain to focusing on its flagship project, Vortex Finance. This pivot also aligns with the company's streamlined operational needs and the current development stage of Vortex Finance, which requires a more targeted funding approach. This structured funding marks a new era for SatoshiPay with its intention to deliver value in the decentralised finance ecosystem.\n\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.

By leveraging Polkadot's multi-chain architecture, Vortex aligns with Web3's mission to foster decentralized technologies that enhance global financial inclusion.\nThe grant will help accelerate the development of key Vortex milestones, such as:\n\u00b7\nA Polkadot offramp which will allow Polkadot users to swap stablecoins like USDC to local fiat currencies such as EUR via Pendulum's Spacewalk bridge;\n\u00b7\nExpanding stablecoin access across Polkadot parachains via Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM);\n\u00b7\nAssist further launches in key markets, such as Brazil and Argentina, where the need for affordable cross-border payments is most critical; and\n\u00b7\nUpgrade Pendulum's Stellar-Polkadot bridge Spacewalk, eliminating the need for liquidity-locking vault operators and increasing efficiency.\nAs part of its commitment to scaling this groundbreaking project, SatoshiPay shareholders have decided to match the Web3 Foundation's grant and are preparing to close a seed financing equity round in the upcoming weeks.\n\"\nThis grant from Web3 Foundation is a testament to the transformative potential of Vortex\n,\" said Alexander Wilke, CEO of SatoshiPay.\n\"Our shareholders' decision to match this support with an equity round highlights the confidence we have in Vortex to revolutionize cross-border payments and drive real-world impact.\n\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.

The New Ordinary Shares created upon implementation of the Capital Reorganisation will have the same rights as the Existing Ordinary Shares including voting, dividend and other rights.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication has been made for the New Ordinary Shares and the Subscription Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\").

Vortex's business model is built around enabling easy to complete currency conversions and bank transfers with ultra-low costs and no hidden fees. Vortex achieves this with a stablecoin-optimised decentralized exchange together with local-currency on and offramp partners.\u00a0By leveraging chain abstraction, Vortex offers a fluid user experience across different blockchain ecosystems. Vortex builds on top of Nabla technology and uses Pendulum infrastructure for\u00a0providing its service to users of various blockchains, e.g. Polygon.\nThe Board's belief is that a successful launch and fund raise for Vortex should significantly improve the perception and value of SatoshiPay and its portfolio of connected de-fi businesses. As a result, the sales process for SatoshiPay has been suspended until Vortex is launched and the value to SatoshiPay can be more clearly demonstrated to, and better understood by, investors. Vortex is already operational and SatoshiPay is currently in the process of sourcing funding for Vortex. Current interest in Vortex appears strong but there is no guarantee that Vortex will secure the additional funding needed to fully launch and exploit its market opportunity.\nThe Company holds a 27.9 per cent. stake in SatoshiPay, and SatoshiPay has an interest of 5.5 per cent. of Pendulum's PEN tokens and a 5.1 per cent position in future Nabla tokens. In the event that SatoshiPay raises further funds by way of issuing equity, the Company's percentage shareholding will likely be reduced and revalued.\nDynasty Gaming & Media Pte Ltd (\"Dynasty\")\nOn 16 July 2024 the Company provided an update on Dynasty and its 100% acquisition of Lets Play Live (\"LPL\"). LPL is the largest gaming tournament operator and broadcaster in Oceania, and the fastest growing in Southeast Asia.\nFollowing the acquisition, Dynasty will consolidate its three platforms, LPL, Googly, and Lightning Dragon into one single platform brand, letsplaylive, and will rename the company to Letsplaylive Media Pte Ltd, following the company's pivot from a B2B to a B2C model.\nAligning to a recognised platform brand in the industry will assist the company with its regional and global reach, prospective partnerships and gaming community recognition. The company anticipates this change to take effect during October 2024, coinciding with significant marketing activity and on-platform events.\nRecent operational highlights include:\nSpark Game Arena Live (\"SGAL\")\nVia Dynasty's LPL brand, it has created and delivered New Zealand's largest ever gaming event, SGAL. This was a 10-week project that culminated in a live physical event on 7 September 2024 at Spark Arena, the country's largest indoor stadium, with a total prize pool of NZ$240,000. Sponsors of the event included LG, Logitech, Visa, Red Bull, Xbox, PlayStation, McClaren and many more. Almost all the major global games publishers were represented at SGAL. Dynasty is currently finalising agreements to produce two further events in both New Zealand and Australia, during 2025.\nPublisher Partnerships\nDynasty is in the final stages of contract negotiations for multi-year regional agreements with several large/recognisable publishers in the gaming industry and anticipate the contract details will be signed and finalised in the near future\n.\nBlue Star has a shareholding of approximately 2 per cent. of Dynasty.\nPaidia Esports Inc (\"Paidia\")\nPaidia, an all-women's esports business, has seen a significant interest in its e-gaming tournament hosting software Paidia Bot, which assists in creating channels, roles and a tournament web page. Paidia Bot is currently installed on 2,000 Discord servers as a beta program, reaching over 60,000 active users. Downloads of the application have increased significantly in recent months demonstrating strong organic market demand with minimal marketing spend or campaigns executed by the company. Paidia anticipates becoming cash flow positive by February 2025.\nThe Company's shareholding in Paidia is currently valued at approximately \u00a3105,000.\nSthaler Limited (\"Sthaler\")\nSthaler continues to work with a number of\ninternational partners on identified customer projects alongside UK domestic strategic opportunities.

Blue Star's investments comprise SatoshiPay Limited, an incubator and service provider to de-fi businesses using blockchain technology; Dynasty Gaming & Media Pte. Ltd., whose B2B white label platform is a full-stack gaming ecosystem; Paidia, a female focussed gaming platform; and Sthaler Limited, an identity and payments technology business which enables a consumer to identify themselves and pay using just their finger\n.\nChairman's Statement\nThe results for the first half of the year show little change from the year end position with all valuations of the Company's investments remaining unaltered, apart from exchange rate movements. The Board has minimized the expenses of running the company wherever possible and has not taken any salaries in cash since 1 February 2024. The sales process for SatoshiPay, which is still ongoing, started later than hoped and has also been slower than expected. There is no guarantee this will process will lead to an acceptable offer and no obligation on the Board or SatoshiPay to accept any offer, but the Board continues to believe this is the only viable way of independently valuing its stake in SatoshiPay.\nBelow we provide the following portfolio company highlights, inclusive of updates, for the six-month period ended 31 March 2024.\nSatoshiPay\nSatoshiPay's mission is to connect the world through instant payments. To achieve this ambition, SatoshiPay is building a portfolio of\nbusinesses around blockchain technology and decentralised finance\n. The first project incubated by SatoshiPay was the Pendulum Network Project (\"Pendulum\") which was established in June 2021.\nPendulum, a smart-blockchain infrastructure technology company, aims to decentralise forex and traditional finance, by providing the missing link between fiat currency and De-Fi ecosystems through a sophisticated smart contract network.In the period under review, Pendulum has achieved a number of key operational milestones, most notably its blockchain bridge connecting the Stellar and Polkadot networks, 'Spacewalk', went live on the Pendulum network in March 2024. Pendulum describes Spacewalk as a trust-minimised decentralised bridge between the Polkadot and Stellar ecosystems, enabling efficient transfers of fiat-backed stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, and serves as a critical link that allows the Pendulum chain to leverage the vast array of fiat-backed stable tokens available on the Stellar blockchain, paving the way for the development of a fiat-based decentralised finance ecosystem.\nThe second project incubated by SatoshiPay was Nabla.fi.\nNabla is a next-generation decentralised exchange designed to optimise swap rates and consequently provide attractive FX rates on-chain. Nabla, which is about to be launched on Pendulum, features oracle-guided pricing and single-sided liquidity provision to achieve this capital efficiency.\nSatoshiPay is also incubating a third project designed to complement Pendulum and Nabla. This innovative platform will enable users to seamlessly swap stablecoins for local fiat currencies at significantly lower costs than current market rates. This presents a substantial opportunity in a rapidly growing market, with cross-border stablecoin payments valued at $27 billion in 2023 and projected to reach $137 billion by 2028. This growth highlights a $14 billion volume in the on/off-ramp market opportunity over the next four years.\nSatoshiPay's strategy is to build a network of projects across the\ndecentralised finance space\nwith the ultimate goal of advancing foreign exchange (\"Forex\") trading into the blockchain space and to integrate a tranche of the US$6.6 trillion traded daily in Forex markets.\nDynasty Gaming an",

US$0.80 per user.\nDynasty has recently finalised agreements with Razorpay as its payment gateway partner and expects to have its payment gateway live and operational within the coming month. This will enable Dynasty to start monetising its Beta users while simultaneously commencing customer acquisition activities at scale.\nLet's Play Live Acquisition\n(Oceania)\nDynasty has agreed to acquire Let's Play Live (\"LPL\") in an all-share transaction approximately for 15 per cent. of Dynasty's issued shares.

The NAB Gateway will provide a comprehensive payments solution for our customers, including Visa, Master, Apple and Googly Pay, BNPL, recurring payments etc.\nLightning Dragon\n(Philippines)\nDynasty's Lighting Dragon platform has been in an extended Beta phase while it introduced payment gateway partners and content providers.

Its in-country partner, the Vera Media Group, has committed to a considerable marketing and promotional spend that the Dynasty board expects to drive significant platform growth.\nProduct Update\nDuring the recent quarter, Dynasty launched User Generated Tournaments (\"UGT\"), which empowers users to create their own tournaments and use micro-transactions to enhance their experience. This provides the creators of UGTs the ability to earn fees from Dynasty's platform, effectively becoming paid tournament organisers themselves.\nIn the second half of the year, Dynasty will launch its new Premium Subscriptions product and seek to expand its subscriber base by making subscriptions more accessible and appealing to a diverse range of users.\nStrategy\nDynasty advises that its focus for the next few quarters will be on using its unique content and significant publisher marketing support to maximise traffic and monetisation across all platforms. with the objective of significantly growing the number of registered users and paying subscribers.

In addition to Stellar's native token, XLM, the following stablecoins are now bridgeable through Spacewalk; EURC; AUDD; NGNC; TZS; and BRL.\nPEN, the native token of Pendulum, will serve as the transaction fee currency within the network.\nPendulum has implemented a cap on the volume of assets that can be bridged, as a part of the company's security protocol during the initial stages of the phased launch. Following the successful completion of subsequent phases, the cap will be steadily raised to permit a greater asset volume transfer.\nBlue Star holds a 27.9 per cent. stake in SatoshiPay, and\nSatoshiPay has an interest of 5.5 per cent. of Pendulum's future PEN tokens\n.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman\nReach is a non-regulatory news service.

The Company has a 27.9% interest in SatoshiPay which is valued on the basis of the last external fund raise in 2019 at approximately \u00a34.65 million.\n-\nThe Company's Net Asset value per share is 0.11p\n-\nPost year end a decision was taken by the management of Dynasty to merge with Googly. To help support Dynasty through this transitioning phase, Blue Star invested US$75,000 in a US$3 million fundraise undertaken by Dynasty in November 2023. The Convertible Loan Note has a two-year expiry period, is non-interest bearing and convertible at a discount of 50 per cent to Dynasty's next funding round.\nThe Annual Report and notice of Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") will be posted to shareholders shortly and will be available to view on the Company's website\nhttp://www.bluestarcapital.co.uk\nThe AGM will be held at the offices of Cairn Financial Advisers LLP, 80 Cheapside, 3rd Floor, EC2V 6EE on 17 April 2024 at 10.30 a.m. Shareholders wishing to vote on any matters of business at the AGM are encouraged to do so through completion of a proxy form which can be completed and submitted to the Company. Proxies should be completed and returned in accordance with the instructions on the form of proxy by no later than 10.30 a.m. on 15 April 2024.\nTony Fabrizi Executive Chairman of Blue Star Capital plc, commented:\n\"\nThe last year was one of considerable disappointment for all those connected with Blue Star. The material and unexpected write down in value in our investment in Dynasty has had a significantly detrimental impact on the Company's net asset value and this has obviously impacted sentiment towards the Company. Our focus is on securing an attractive offer for our shareholding in SatoshiPay later this year at which point the Board will consult with shareholders over the Company's future\n.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray\nChairman's Statement\nBlue Star Capital plc (\"the Company\" or \"Blue Star\") provides investors with exposure to a portfolio of geographically diverse companies in high-growth, disruptive technology sectors.\nDuring the period, the Company's Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") decreased by 53% to \u00a35,329,347 (2022: \u00a311,414,507) with the Company incurring a pre-tax loss of \u00a36,328,408 (2022: loss \u00a31,301,008). The signi?cant decline in NAV and loss for the year principally re?ect the write down of our investments in Dynasty Media & Gaming and Sthaler plus the losses incurred on the realisation of the Company's quoted investments. The Company ended the year with cash of \u00a363,158 (2022: \u00a386,575).\nIn September 2022, the Board set out its strategy for the next two years. The key components were to refrain from making any new investments while it sought offers for its shareholdings in SatoshiPay and Dynasty. The Board also advised that, if possible, it would endeavour to manage the business without any further equity raises.\nWe provide the following portfolio company overviews for the year ended 30 September 2023.\nBlockchain and decentralised ?nance\nSatoshiPay's mission is to connect the world through instant payments. To achieve this ambition, SatoshiPay is initially focusing on building the Pendulum Network Project (\"Pendulum\").\nPendulum, a smart-blockchain infrastructure technology company, aims to decentralize forex and traditional ?nance, by providing the missing link between ?at currency and De-Fi ecosystems through a sophisticated smart contract network. Pendulum is committed to advancing foreign exchange (\"Forex\") trading into the blockchain space to integrate a tranche of the US$6.6 trillion traded daily in Forex markets.\nIn the period under review, Pendulum has achieved ",

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

For the Company to regularly RNS progress and developments would be quite costly , I assume that is the reason for using X to keep shareholders updated on progress in a cost effective maner . Unfortunately this is likely to have limited effect on visibility in the overall market which is probably why there is this huge disparity between valuation and reality . Until there is either the necessity to RNS information or some major event we will probably drift along as the wider market remains oblivious to the real potential here . Just imagine the effect a tie up with Visa or Mastercard would do to our valuation ...........Masterstroke ~~~ VIVA Visa  ! VGLA .",

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

I suspect , like many investors here , I am frustrated by the paltry valuation and lack of market recognition for this business. Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

For the Company to regularly RNS progress and developments would be quite costly , I assume that is the reason for using X to keep shareholders updated on progress in a cost effective maner . Unfortunately this is likely to have limited effect on visibility in the overall market which is probably why there is this huge disparity between valuation and reality . Until there is either the necessity to RNS information or some major event we will probably drift along as the wider market remains oblivious to the real potential here . Just imagine the effect a tie up with Visa or Mastercard would do to our valuation ...........Masterstroke ~~~ VIVA Visa  ! VGLA .",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

Because the number of followers for Vortex and SatoshiPay (on X for example) are so small as to be irrelevant. The lack of RNS or any other meaningful update on the SatoshiPay website (or indeed the Vortex Telegram channel, if you want to include that) suggests to me that there is little (or no) progress. What I would like to see are: 1. Clear evidence that Vortex is working, as evidenced by actual numbers 2. Director buying - Tony Fabrizzi needs to show us he's got skin in the game by buying some shares. He can argue as much as he likes about working unpaid for the past few years, but since he was the one who stated publicly - two years ago - that the fair value of the business was more than 24p, he needs to take responsibility as a director. And neither do I think his \"warrants\" are justified. 3. An update from the Board about the other businesses in which BLU has a shareholding. What's happened to Dynasty, for example? or Paidia, or Sthaler (as shown under \"Portfolio\" on the BLU website) This is fast becoming a joke",

Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

However , I am a very enthusiastic supporter of the concept , now proven , the Management and the huge potential future value generation for the Company . I suspect , like many investors here , I am frustrated by the paltry valuation and lack of market recognition for this business. Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

Especially , in my considered opinion , when the net amount of sells is hardly greater than the buys . There are some explicable reasons for the decline (eg lack of tangible development . perhaps  financial pressures  ) but in my opinion the share price would seem to have been very deliberately `Managed ` . The question is WHY ? Again , entirely speculation on my part I am wondering if the reason behind this is the determination to complete the integration of Satoshipay in some arrangement that excludes a cash element for which Blu , at this point in time , is unable to provide . As I recall the BoD stated that BLU would acquire the remaining 50% of Satoshipay this quarter . I am very curious as to how that might be achieved ! Assuming a satisfactory conclusion to this integration I think the BLU Anyway ~ just my thoughts on what is proving now to be a slow burn development . I have a reasonable holding here and even though disappointed at the slow state of progress I have no intention of selling . In fact I would be happy to double my stake as soon as the mist rises and I can see a clear way forward . GL ~Investors !",

Because the number of followers for Vortex and SatoshiPay (on X for example) are so small as to be irrelevant. The lack of RNS or any other meaningful update on the SatoshiPay website (or indeed the Vortex Telegram channel, if you want to include that) suggests to me that there is little (or no) progress. What I would like to see are: 1. Clear evidence that Vortex is working, as evidenced by actual numbers 2. Director buying - Tony Fabrizzi needs to show us he's got skin in the game by buying some shares. He can argue as much as he likes about working unpaid for the past few years, but since he was the one who stated publicly - two years ago - that the fair value of the business was more than 24p, he needs to take responsibility as a director. And neither do I think his \"warrants\" are justified. 3. An update from the Board about the other businesses in which BLU has a shareholding. What's happened to Dynasty, for example? or Paidia, or Sthaler (as shown under \"Portfolio\" on the BLU website) This is fast becoming a joke",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

I said I had read the document a few months ago and acknowledged it was higher risk. After that I could just buy over the phone. Phone buying fees were waved. If needed you can just say you read someone could buy Blue shares 2nd January. Good luck!",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

          "full_content": "2 Feb 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 2779R\nBlue Star Capital plc\n02 February 2026\n2 February 2026\nBlue Star Capital plc\n(\"Blue Star\"\nor the\n\"Company\")\nSatoshiPay Update\nBlue Star Capital plc (AIM: BLU), the investing company with a focus on blockchain, payments and esports, provides the following updates related to its investee company SatoshiPay Ltd (\"\nSatoshiPay\n\").\nVortex Update\nIn January 2026, Vortex, SatoshiPay's fiat-to-crypto infrastructure platform, processed over US$10 million in total monthly transaction volumes. This marks a significant milestone for the Company, following processing US$4.8 million in December 2025. As announced on 5 January 2026, the growth of Vortex has been largely driven by the onboarding of new API clients, reflecting strong adoption of SatoshiPay's payment infrastructure. Vortex has now processed approximately US$20 million in total cumulative transactions.\nVortex continues to expand its geographical reach and is planning on expanding into the United States through a multi-currency partnership with Alfredpay which\nis intended to serve as a cornerstone for the North American operations of Vortex\n.\nThe technical integration phase of this partnership is\ncurrently in the development and sandbox testing stage. Once finalized, the partnership aims to leverage Alfredpay's infrastructure to enable broader access to stablecoin-powered payment solutions, significantly enhancing Vortex's geographical reach and cross-border capabilities.\nThe Vortex platform continues to expand its reach within the stablecoin sector, which recorded over US$8 trillion in transfer volumes on Ethereum in Q4 2025. To capitalise on this trend, Vortex has recently listed over 250 new crypto tokens, transforming its platform into a robust lead generation and fiat access gateway for global Web3 communities.\nIn addition, Vortex has been inducted into the Circle Alliance Partner Programme, aligning SatoshiPay with Circle, the issuer of USDC. This collaboration reinforces SatoshiPay's commitment to transparency, compliance, and liquidity, positioning Vortex within a global network of DeFi operators.\nPendulum Update\nDuring January 2026, PEN, the native token of Pendulum, a decentralized organization co-founded by SatoshiPay, achieved key milestones across both centralised and decentralised markets. As of 26 January 2026, the PEN token transitioned to the Innovation Zone on MEXC, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, following a rigorous platform evaluation and demonstrating compliance with liquidity and order book depth requirements.\nIn the decentralised ecosystem, PEN has secured the top ranking in the Isolated Pool section on Hydration, Polkadot's leading decentralised exchange. Furthermore, PEN has now become the official access token for the Vortex platform, with a portion of platform fees processed in PEN. As a result, every transaction on Vortex generates demand for the token, linking platform growth with token utility. SatoshiPay currently owns approximately 12 per cent of the total supply of PEN tokens.\nSatoshiPay Update\nAdditionally, the Company notes that SatoshiPay has made available on its website a presentation that outlines SatoshiPay's recent growth and its management's expectations regarding future prospect. The presentation can be found at\nhttps://www.satoshipay.io/\n.\nThe Company notes that the presentation includes a valuation analysis completed by SatoshiPay. The figures in the presentation are derived from internal company research, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties, and have not undergone an independent valuation.\nOutlook\nThe Board is encouraged by SatoshiPay's operational progress and the momentum achieved across its key growth initiatives. With the continued integration of API partners and the expansion into the United States underway, SatoshiPay is well positioned to deliver further growth in H1 2026.\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation. The Directors of the Company take responsibility for this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.

So lets say they make $120m in transactions this year, thats $3m USD (on a 10x multiple $30m USD / $15m USD to BLU which is double the current market cap at 12p) If that grows to $20m a month then we are looking at a much higher valuation ~$60m which is 4x the current market cap, but that would also be pricing in no growth again in 2027 So if they can hit these figures / maintain, then an IPO in 2027 becomes a very smart idea, and you could be looking at a valuation anywhere between $90m to $180m USD, if not more (and I am being conservative, as the presentation suggests way more in 2028/2029 But I wont get ahead of myself, we need consistent figures, they have had an incredible month and the growth looks off the charts, can it be sustained? If so then 4x in the next few months is on the cards, and a 10-20x in the next few years.",

Because the number of followers for Vortex and SatoshiPay (on X for example) are so small as to be irrelevant. The lack of RNS or any other meaningful update on the SatoshiPay website (or indeed the Vortex Telegram channel, if you want to include that) suggests to me that there is little (or no) progress. What I would like to see are: 1. Clear evidence that Vortex is working, as evidenced by actual numbers 2. Director buying - Tony Fabrizzi needs to show us he's got skin in the game by buying some shares. He can argue as much as he likes about working unpaid for the past few years, but since he was the one who stated publicly - two years ago - that the fair value of the business was more than 24p, he needs to take responsibility as a director. And neither do I think his \"warrants\" are justified. 3. An update from the Board about the other businesses in which BLU has a shareholding. What's happened to Dynasty, for example? or Paidia, or Sthaler (as shown under \"Portfolio\" on the BLU website) This is fast becoming a joke",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

          "content": "At $10m a month its excellent I posted about this back in November when it was $2m a month and said I would buy if it could prove it could growth to over $10m USD, didn't expect it so quickly. Its basically 0.025% per transaction, so 2.5p per \u00a31 or 2.5 cents per $ to be more precise So at the moment they are at $10m PCM Which is $250,000 in fees 50% ownership (so $125,000 net to BLU, but keep it under Satoshipay as thats the valuation uplift we need) So with NO growth, at current run rate, its $250K per month or $3m USD per annum In the vortex presentation, they list companies that trade between 10-20x revenues, but lets not get ahead of ourselves and say its worth $30-60m USD right now after one month of EXCELLENT figures, plus they forecast $15m USD for February which would be a valuation of around $45-90m USD Thats with a full year of no growth, they are expanding rapidly, this is genuinely exciting. So lets say they make $120m in transactions this year, thats $3m USD (on a 10x multiple $30m USD / $15m USD to BLU which is double the current market cap at 12p) If that grows to $20m a month then we are looking at a much higher valuation ~$60m which is 4x the current market cap, but that would also be pricing in no growth again in 2027 So if they can hit these figures / maintain, then an IPO in 2027 becomes a very smart idea, and you could be looking at a valuation anywhere between $90m to $180m USD, if not more (and I am being conservative, as the presentation suggests way more in 2028/2029 But I wont get ahead of myself, we need consistent figures, they have had an incredible month and the growth looks off the charts, can it be sustained? If so then 4x in the next few months is on the cards, and a 10-20x in the next few years.",

Because the number of followers for Vortex and SatoshiPay (on X for example) are so small as to be irrelevant. The lack of RNS or any other meaningful update on the SatoshiPay website (or indeed the Vortex Telegram channel, if you want to include that) suggests to me that there is little (or no) progress. What I would like to see are: 1. Clear evidence that Vortex is working, as evidenced by actual numbers 2. Director buying - Tony Fabrizzi needs to show us he's got skin in the game by buying some shares. He can argue as much as he likes about working unpaid for the past few years, but since he was the one who stated publicly - two years ago - that the fair value of the business was more than 24p, he needs to take responsibility as a director. And neither do I think his \"warrants\" are justified. 3. An update from the Board about the other businesses in which BLU has a shareholding. What's happened to Dynasty, for example? or Paidia, or Sthaler (as shown under \"Portfolio\" on the BLU website) This is fast becoming a joke",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely !

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

Here about 6 months ago we had 2-3 days of solid blue trades and the price didn't move. One sell on the day after dropped the share 10%. Very frustrating and annoying to see. The regulation need to be so much tighter, but no doubt the one's behind the rules are the one's that benefit.",

As I recall that 100k `Unknown` trade was deliberately delayed , the price paid clearly indicated it could only have been a buy but it was placed among a string of tiny BOT sells to eliminate its impact . Yes these markets are rotten to the core and It seems as if the MM`s are behind the price manipulation using ridiculous margins and probably other tactics (Bots / late reporting ) presumably the objective simply to generate volume and trade margin irrespective of the buy / sell direction . As another poster mentioned ~ a great buying price . True , but this sort of devious activity is not supportive of business and is reputation damaging . Only the MM is a beneficiary . I remain committed to the Company but this ongoing manipulation is VERY frustrating ~ and dishonest  . imo .",

Its basically 0.025% per transaction, so 2.5p per \u00a31 or 2.5 cents per $ to be more precise So at the moment they are at $10m PCM Which is $250,000 in fees 50% ownership (so $125,000 net to BLU, but keep it under Satoshipay as thats the valuation uplift we need) So with NO growth, at current run rate, its $250K per month or $3m USD per annum In the vortex presentation, they list companies that trade between 10-20x revenues, but lets not get ahead of ourselves and say its worth $30-60m USD right now after one month of EXCELLENT figures, plus they forecast $15m USD for February which would be a valuation of around $45-90m USD Thats with a full year of no growth, they are expanding rapidly, this is genuinely exciting. So lets say they make $120m in transactions this year, thats $3m USD (on a 10x multiple $30m USD / $15m USD to BLU which is double the current market cap at 12p) If that grows to $20m a month then we are looking at a much higher valuation ~$60m which is 4x the current market cap, but that would also be pricing in no growth again in 2027 So if they can hit these figures / maintain, then an IPO in 2027 becomes a very smart idea, and you could be looking at a valuation anywhere between $90m to $180m USD, if not more (and I am being conservative, as the presentation suggests way more in 2028/2029 But I wont get ahead of myself, we need consistent figures, they have had an incredible month and the growth looks off the charts, can it be sustained?

Because the number of followers for Vortex and SatoshiPay (on X for example) are so small as to be irrelevant. The lack of RNS or any other meaningful update on the SatoshiPay website (or indeed the Vortex Telegram channel, if you want to include that) suggests to me that there is little (or no) progress. What I would like to see are: 1. Clear evidence that Vortex is working, as evidenced by actual numbers 2. Director buying - Tony Fabrizzi needs to show us he's got skin in the game by buying some shares. He can argue as much as he likes about working unpaid for the past few years, but since he was the one who stated publicly - two years ago - that the fair value of the business was more than 24p, he needs to take responsibility as a director. And neither do I think his \"warrants\" are justified. 3. An update from the Board about the other businesses in which BLU has a shareholding. What's happened to Dynasty, for example? or Paidia, or Sthaler (as shown under \"Portfolio\" on the BLU website) This is fast becoming a joke",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

If needed you can just say you read someone could buy Blue shares 2nd January. Good luck!",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",

As I recall that 100k `Unknown` trade was deliberately delayed , the price paid clearly indicated it could only have been a buy but it was placed among a string of tiny BOT sells to eliminate its impact . Yes these markets are rotten to the core and It seems as if the MM`s are behind the price manipulation using ridiculous margins and probably other tactics (Bots / late reporting ) presumably the objective simply to generate volume and trade margin irrespective of the buy / sell direction . As another poster mentioned ~ a great buying price . True , but this sort of devious activity is not supportive of business and is reputation damaging . Only the MM is a beneficiary . I remain committed to the Company but this ongoing manipulation is VERY frustrating ~ and dishonest  . imo .",

As I recall that 100k `Unknown` trade was deliberately delayed , the price paid clearly indicated it could only have been a buy but it was placed among a string of tiny BOT sells to eliminate its impact . Yes these markets are rotten to the core and It seems as if the MM`s are behind the price manipulation using ridiculous margins and probably other tactics (Bots / late reporting ) presumably the objective simply to generate volume and trade margin irrespective of the buy / sell direction . As another poster mentioned ~ a great buying price . True , but this sort of devious activity is not supportive of business and is reputation damaging . Only the MM is a beneficiary . I remain committed to the Company but this ongoing manipulation is VERY frustrating ~ and dishonest  . imo .",

Key details regarding Alfred Pay's fees and, in some cases, other entities named \"Alfred\": Remittance/Transaction Fees: Alfred Pay charges 3% for its core cross-border services, which utilize USDC stablecoins to move money, often settling in 4 to 6 seconds. Business Services (API/Platform): Alfred offers lower fees than traditional FX for businesses converting fiat to stablecoins and vice versa. It supports onramps (bank-to-crypto) and offramps (crypto-to-bank). Coverage & Payment Methods: Fees apply to instant PIX transfers (Brazil), local bank transfers (SPEI in Mexico, ACH in Colombia), and, in some cases, retail cash transactions. No Hidden Fees: The platform claims to have transparent pricing, with no registration fees. Note on \"Alfred\" vs \"Alfred Pay\": Alfred Pay (alfredpay.io): Crypto-based remittances in LATAM (3% fee). Alfred (alfredtheapp.com): A property management app with a $1 in-app fee for transactions over $5. Meet Alfred (meetalfred.com): LinkedIn automation software with monthly subscription fees.",

Its basically 0.025% per transaction, so 2.5p per \u00a31 or 2.5 cents per $ to be more precise So at the moment they are at $10m PCM Which is $250,000 in fees 50% ownership (so $125,000 net to BLU, but keep it under Satoshipay as thats the valuation uplift we need) So with NO growth, at current run rate, its $250K per month or $3m USD per annum In the vortex presentation, they list companies that trade between 10-20x revenues, but lets not get ahead of ourselves and say its worth $30-60m USD right now after one month of EXCELLENT figures, plus they forecast $15m USD for February which would be a valuation of around $45-90m USD Thats with a full year of no growth, they are expanding rapidly, this is genuinely exciting. So lets say they make $120m in transactions this year, thats $3m USD (on a 10x multiple $30m USD / $15m USD to BLU which is double the current market cap at 12p) If that grows to $20m a month then we are looking at a much higher valuation ~$60m which is 4x the current market cap, but that would also be pricing in no growth again in 2027 So if they can hit these figures / maintain, then an IPO in 2027 becomes a very smart idea, and you could be looking at a valuation anywhere between $90m to $180m USD, if not more (and I am being conservative, as the presentation suggests way more in 2028/2029 But I wont get ahead of myself, we need consistent figures, they have had an incredible month and the growth looks off the charts, can it be sustained? If so then 4x in the next few months is on the cards, and a 10-20x in the next few years.",

Because the number of followers for Vortex and SatoshiPay (on X for example) are so small as to be irrelevant. The lack of RNS or any other meaningful update on the SatoshiPay website (or indeed the Vortex Telegram channel, if you want to include that) suggests to me that there is little (or no) progress. What I would like to see are: 1. Clear evidence that Vortex is working, as evidenced by actual numbers 2. Director buying - Tony Fabrizzi needs to show us he's got skin in the game by buying some shares. He can argue as much as he likes about working unpaid for the past few years, but since he was the one who stated publicly - two years ago - that the fair value of the business was more than 24p, he needs to take responsibility as a director. And neither do I think his \"warrants\" are justified. 3. An update from the Board about the other businesses in which BLU has a shareholding. What's happened to Dynasty, for example? or Paidia, or Sthaler (as shown under \"Portfolio\" on the BLU website) This is fast becoming a joke",

I also feel that BLU could be snapped up , but I`m more concerned at the possibility of someone getting first prize for next to nothing . I think I mentioned this sometime ago ; I am very suspicious about the trading pattern in the stock eg ; Many trades catagorised as unknown , transactions of shares in single digits suggesting computer driven price control , value driven down to an unrealistic c.4.5 M ...etc.......  could a potential predator already be acquiring and maintaining an interest just below the declaration level ? Take them out now , use them later ? It would be an absolute tragedy should someone take BLU out a knock down firesale price . Do you think it likely that BLU would use funds in treasury to address their commitment to acquire a further share of Satoshipay ?",

Satoshipay use Bitcoin as a liquidity model. Bitcoin has no transactional fees between FIAT currencies. E.G bitcoin is worth the same in Uganda as it is in London or New York. So when a transaction occurs on FIAT there are no fees. Hence, we're in a better position to offer lower rates than our competitors (VISA / MASTERCARD) / many others who use actual, at the time transaction costs based on local costs. The Satoshipay model is something to admire, because it is way ahead of the game and we're growing day by day and there is only a matter of time before one of the big boys snaps us up at a HUGE premium in order to shut us down.",

Thinking about this issue I list a number of issues that `May` be some of reasons behind this anomaly: * Company visibility ,  Investor ignorance , * A lack of understanding of this operation and its complex financial facets . * Perception of countries where Vortex transactions are predominant . * Concerns over cash requirement to further operational growth . * Clarity regarding further Satoshipay integration and costs . * Progress re Visa and Mastercard . * Delays in signing API`s . * Volatilty of Bitcoin impacting BTC and ETH treasury . * MM sp manipulation ~ exploiting above . Despite the above I am adding again at these silly prices but not very good at my timing . I bought another tranche on Friday thinking the brakes were coming off , should have waited until today :( Frustrated ~ Yes .  Committed Absolutely ! Just a matter of time before all the above are addressed and this results in a very dramatic rerate , ~~~ IMO .",

          "content": "2025 was the year AIM showed its resilience, rising nearly 10pc after enduring years of higher interest rates in the wake of the pandemic and continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It\u2019s been the market\u2019s best year for fundraising since the boom year of 2021: by the end of August AIM-listed companies had raised \u00a32.1bn from IPOs and secondary fundraisings (shares sold by current shareholders rather than issued by the company itself), more than double the \u00a3889m raised in the previous 12 months. AIM has continued to dominate Europe\u2019s growth markets, accounting for 53pc of all capital raised across European small cap indices over the past five years: more money than its five nearest European rivals combined. IPOs on London\u2019s junior market rebounded through the 2024/25 financial year, 16 companies listing so far against just nine last year. The average amount of new money raised per IPO was \u00a39.9m, up from the low of \u00a36.8m recorded in 2022/23. And there are good grounds for believing the revival will gather pace in 2026. The brutal shakeout over the last few years has left a core of higher quality, better capitalised companies better able to inspire investor confidence. As a junior market AIM is particularly well positioned to benefit from the prospect of lower interest rates that will ease the debt burden of smaller companies. And it is a particular focus of ongoing efforts by policy makers (across all major parties) and regulators to improve the competitiveness of London\u2019s markets and direct more investment into UK assets. In his annual review of the small cap sector Investors\u2019 Chronicle associate editor Simon Thompson notes that UK equities continue to be undervalued relative to US shares, particularly AIM-listed tech. Plenty of opportunities exist for canny stockpickers amid the many small caps with low earnings multiples. The prospect of lower interest rates and \u2013 in due course \u2013 market reform augur well for AIM\u2019s continued recovery in 2026. And though investors rightly look to the junior market for short-term gains they should not lose sight of one of the most well observed market patterns, frequently highlighted by TMS: the tendency of small caps to outperform their larger counterparts over time. The pattern has asserted itself in recent history, small and mid-sized companies generating a return premium over their larger peers of 6pc between 2009 and 2021. AIM was designed precisely to provide a framework for small cap growth over extended periods. For investors willing to do their homework, manage risk, spread their money over different sectors, and hold on to promising shares through tough times, AIM offers as many opportunities as it ever has. Here, we look at 10 Companies from a variety of sectors that have performed in 2025 or which may be positioned for a better year ahead. Also look out for our roundup of new year selections for Oil & Gas plus mining stocks. Enjoy. https://total-marke",

I have no idea who is responsible or what their objective might be , could be anyone from a MM to some third party trying to manage the sp . I simply dont like it because it is obscure and `May` be deceptive . The toothless FCA are supposed to monitor and approve such activity , but I have as much confidence in that lot as the value of an ash tray on a motorbike . I could guess at several reasons behind this activity , but that would only be an unhelpful guess without knowledge or proof . I suppose on the plus side , I think this indicates that we are and will remain at or around this price point until transformational news is released . By that I believe there are some obvious triggers : *  Additional APIs * Visa / Mastercard signing . * Completion of Satoshipay integration . * A N Other arrangement . I also believe that transformational news could arrive at any time and that a very large spike in value and sp would be inevitable . (A possible reason for pegging the current sp .) In that context it must be far too risky to be out rather than in . If you believe in this Company , it`s Management and its Potential then c. 12p represents a LCTB at this silly c. 4M valuation . The privisor being that you must be patient and wait for one of those triggers , which , IMO , will arrive this year . Just my thoughts ~ good luck ~ Investors. .",
