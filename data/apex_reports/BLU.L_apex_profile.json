This marks a significant milestone for the Company, following processing US$4.8 million in December 2025. As announced on 5 January 2026, the growth of Vortex has been largely driven by the onboarding of new API clients, reflecting strong adoption of SatoshiPay's payment infrastructure. Vortex has now processed approximately US$20 million in total cumulative transactions.\nVortex continues to expand its geographical reach and is planning on expanding into the United States through a multi-currency partnership with Alfredpay which\nis intended to serve as a cornerstone for the North American operations of Vortex\n.\nThe technical integration phase of this partnership is\ncurrently in the development and sandbox testing stage. Once finalized, the partnership aims to leverage Alfredpay's infrastructure to enable broader access to stablecoin-powered payment solutions, significantly enhancing Vortex's geographical reach and cross-border capabilities.\nThe Vortex platform continues to expand its reach within the stablecoin sector, which recorded over US$8 trillion in transfer volumes on Ethereum in Q4 2025. To capitalise on this trend, Vortex has recently listed over 250 new crypto tokens, transforming its platform into a robust lead generation and fiat access gateway for global Web3 communities.\nIn addition, Vortex has been inducted into the Circle Alliance Partner Programme, aligning SatoshiPay with Circle, the issuer of USDC. This collaboration reinforces SatoshiPay's commitment to transparency, compliance, and liquidity, positioning Vortex within a global network of DeFi operators.\nPendulum Update\nDuring January 2026, PEN, the native token of Pendulum, a decentralized organization co-founded by SatoshiPay, achieved key milestones across both centralised and decentralised markets. As of 26 January 2026, the PEN token transitioned to the Innovation Zone on MEXC, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, following a rigorous platform evaluation and demonstrating compliance with liquidity and order book depth requirements.\nIn the decentralised ecosystem, PEN has secured the top ranking in the Isolated Pool section on Hydration, Polkadot's leading decentralised exchange. Furthermore, PEN has now become the official access token for the Vortex platform, with a portion of platform fees processed in PEN. As a result, every transaction on Vortex generates demand for the token, linking platform growth with token utility. SatoshiPay currently owns approximately 12 per cent of the total supply of PEN tokens.\nSatoshiPay Update\nAdditionally, the Company notes that SatoshiPay has made available on its website a presentation that outlines SatoshiPay's recent growth and its management's expectations regarding future prospect. The presentation can be found at\nhttps://www.satoshipay.io/\n.\nThe Company notes that the presentation includes a valuation analysis completed by SatoshiPay. The figures in the presentation are derived from internal company research, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties, and have not undergone an independent valuation.\nOutlook\nThe Board is encouraged by SatoshiPay's operational progress and the momentum achieved across its key growth initiatives. With the continued integration of API partners and the expansion into the United States underway, SatoshiPay is well positioned to deliver further growth in H1 2026.\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

Valuations have been prepared using spot crypto prices as of 30 December 2025, with inputs of BTC EUR74,583.38, ETH EUR2,528.49 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.17732, as per the table below:\nDigital Asset\nCode\nPrincipal Quantity\nSpot Price\n(EUR)\nTotal Value\n(EUR)\nPerformance since inception\n(27/08/25)\nBitcoin\nBTC\n9.27\n74,583.38\n691,188.03\n-24.74%\nEthereum\nETH\n72.03\n2,528.49\n182,135.62\n-20.69%\nGross Total\n873,323.65\nAggregate\nPerformance\n-23.93%\nYield and Fees\nDespite the reduction in the portfolio's spot valuation driven by movements in BTC and ETH prices, the Treasury has generated positive yield over the period. This yield includes returns generated from decentralised finance liquidity provisioning, including activity associated with Vortex. Since inception, the Treasury has had an unrealised yield of USD11,275 and a realised and withdrawn yield of USD75,297, equating to an average annualised APR of 18.01% calculated on a simple basis from realised yield since 27 August 2025.\nT\nhe gross portfolio value of the Treasury is EUR882,934.04 and excluding accrued unrealised yield is EUR873,323.65.\nThe Company is encouraged by the Treasury's yield generation to date. SatoshiPay remains focused on monitoring both portfolio valuation and yield generation and views the Treasury management as an important part of its strategy to optimise returns from digital assets.\nAPR figures are calculated on a simple annualised basis from realised yield over the period since inception.\nThe Company intends to announce the performance of SatoshiPay's Treasury on a quarterly basis, with the next period ending 30 March 2026.\nVortex Update\nFurther to the announcement on 11 November 2025, Vortex, SatoshiPay's fiat-to-crypto infrastructure platform processed over US$4.8 million in transaction volumes for the month of December 2025, representing a month on month increase of over 52%. Since its launch, Vortex has now processed over US$9.9 million in cumulative transaction volumes.\nThe Board of the Company is encouraged by Vortex's performance since its inception, including its recent API partner onboarding, and will continue to update the market with further developments.\nThe Company currently has an approximate 50 per cent. shareholding in SatoshiPay.\nDirector Remuneration and Grant of Warrants\nAdditionally, the Company announces that, in order to preserve cash for deployment within the business, it has agreed to pay the Directors a reduced salary and has granted the Directors warrants over ordinary shares in the Company (\"\nWarrants\n\") as partial remuneration in lieu of salary. The Directors have not received any salary in respect of their roles since January 2024 in order to maximise available cash for the Company's portfolio of investments.\nThe Warrants have been granted as follows:\nWarrant Holder\nNumber of Warrants Granted\nExercise Price (\u00a3)\nWarrants granted as a percentage of issued share capital\nAnthony Fabrizi\n700,000\n0.11\n1.47%\nMeinhard Benn\n350,000\n0.11\n0.74%\nSean King\n175,000\n0.11\n0.37%\nThe Warrants have an exercise period of 2 years and the exercise price of \u00a30.11, representing a premium to the closing mid-market price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on 31 December 2025 of approximately 22 per cent.

Conversion of the SAFE funding into equity will only occur in the event of satisfying its predefined conditions, including but not limited to; a future funding round,\na change of control, or an IPO, as outlined in the SAFE agreement.\nThe SAFE funding was completed at a post money valuation cap of EUR3.5 million, which sets the maximum price at which the SAFE funding converts.\nT\nhe true valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the conversion will depend on the terms of any future equity funding round.\nThe SAFE fundraise will provide SatoshiPay with sufficient working capital ahead of a further anticipated Series A fundraising for SatoshiPay in first half of 2026.\nSatoshiPay will use the funds to accelerate its South American market expansion and broaden blockchain integrations across key networks including Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, strengthening its multi-chain and interoperability capabilities.\nExisting clients, already transacting substantial volumes through Vortex, requested an API to automate their flows and increase frequency. SatoshiPay has now launched this API and an automated pool-rebalancing system, enabling these partners to scale activity significantly.\nIn parallel, Vortex is in\nadvanced discussions regarding\nintegrating with a leading global crypto\n-\nfiat gateway aggregator\n,\nconnecting to over 50 wallets and exchanges, including MetaMask, Phantom and Paybis\n, which may\nopen access to a broad, high-margin customer base and further expand Vortex's commercial reach.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course.\nSubject to the SAFE being fully converted at the point of a future funding round Blue Star's shareholding will change but the extent of this change will be dependent on the amount raised and the valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the SAFE conversion.\nUntil such a conversion takes place, Blue Star's current shareholding of approximately 50 per cent. remains unchanged.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman said\n\"\nWe are pleased with ongoing progress at SatoshiPay and keen to support their growth plans with our latest funding support through the SAFE structure. The recent improvements in the Vortex platform lays the foundations for significant future growth and we look forward to updating the market with their progress during the remainder of the year.\n\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.
