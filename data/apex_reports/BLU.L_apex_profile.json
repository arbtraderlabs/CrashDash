Conversion of the SAFE funding into equity will only occur in the event of satisfying its predefined conditions, including but not limited to; a future funding round,\na change of control, or an IPO, as outlined in the SAFE agreement.\nThe SAFE funding was completed at a post money valuation cap of EUR3.5 million, which sets the maximum price at which the SAFE funding converts.\nT\nhe true valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the conversion will depend on the terms of any future equity funding round.\nThe SAFE fundraise will provide SatoshiPay with sufficient working capital ahead of a further anticipated Series A fundraising for SatoshiPay in first half of 2026.\nSatoshiPay will use the funds to accelerate its South American market expansion and broaden blockchain integrations across key networks including Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, strengthening its multi-chain and interoperability capabilities.\nExisting clients, already transacting substantial volumes through Vortex, requested an API to automate their flows and increase frequency. SatoshiPay has now launched this API and an automated pool-rebalancing system, enabling these partners to scale activity significantly.\nIn parallel, Vortex is in\nadvanced discussions regarding\nintegrating with a leading global crypto\n-\nfiat gateway aggregator\n,\nconnecting to over 50 wallets and exchanges, including MetaMask, Phantom and Paybis\n, which may\nopen access to a broad, high-margin customer base and further expand Vortex's commercial reach.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course.\nSubject to the SAFE being fully converted at the point of a future funding round Blue Star's shareholding will change but the extent of this change will be dependent on the amount raised and the valuation of SatoshiPay at the time of the SAFE conversion.\nUntil such a conversion takes place, Blue Star's current shareholding of approximately 50 per cent. remains unchanged.\nTony Fabrizi, Executive Chairman said\n\"\nWe are pleased with ongoing progress at SatoshiPay and keen to support their growth plans with our latest funding support through the SAFE structure. The recent improvements in the Vortex platform lays the foundations for significant future growth and we look forward to updating the market with their progress during the remainder of the year.\n\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor more information please contact:\nBlue Star Capital plc\n+44 (0) 777 178 2434\nTony Fabrizi\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0) 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner / Liam Murray / Ed Downes\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3026 0449\n(Sole Broker)\nLewis Jones\nAbout Blue Star\nBlue Star is an investing company with a focus on new technologies.
