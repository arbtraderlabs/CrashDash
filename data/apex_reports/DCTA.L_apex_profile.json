Production enhancements to develop interlocked and blended graphene materials have broadened the portfolio, further enabling the Group to address high-growth applications including PFAS-related fields, defence and highly regulated industrial sectors. These important development come at the time when interest in the graphene market is growing exponentially as market participants look to incorporate graphene into existing products and products road maps.\nSetcar review and contract win\nManagement continues to focus on restructuring initiatives across Setcar, which has generated significant headcount reductions, operational efficiencies and margin improvements for at least \u20ac0.7m of annualised cost savings in FY25. Setcar is now better positioned to pursue opportunities within the strategically important Environmental Remediation market, underpinned by its technical expertise and extensive regulatory approvals.\nIn December 2025, Setcar won a competitive tender for a \u20ac1.5m Total Waste Management contract with Ford for a further 15 months. The company is now in the process of finalising the formal contract.\nWork to deliver further efficiencies at Setcar is progressing and the\u00a0Board will continue to evaluate the best options, improving overall capital allocation and how best to maximise shareholder value.\nSeparately, a process has commenced to realise the potential sale of non-strategic land held by Setcar, with an estimated value of at least \u20ac0.5m.\n2026 Outlook\nThe Board is laser focused on capturing high-growth graphene-based opportunities, monetising Directa's core IP, which remains protected by a substantial patent portfolio.\nThe Board continues to evaluate its options to realise value from this portfolio, including partnerships, joint ventures and licensing, and to assess its optimum options to secure the requisite funding which will be needed in FY26 to support future growth.\nThe Group closed FY25 with gross cash balances of \u20ac1.5m (FY24: \u20ac4.98m), providing a solid financial base going forward. Entering FY26, Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products.\nBoard changes\nRichard Hickinbotham, Non-Executive Chairman, who would have shortly completed his nine-year tenure with the Group, has informed the Board of his intention to take up a full-time executive role and will step down from the Board on 31 January 2026. Giulio Cesareo will assume the role of Interim plc Chairman with effect from that date.\nThe CEO succession process, as previously announced, is being progressed and a further update will be provided in due course.\nGiulio Cesareo, Chief Executive Officer at Directa Plus,\nsaid:\n\"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in EBITDA performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the Group. These actions have positioned us to better address high-growth, highly regulated markets where our graphene-based solutions have demonstrated clear added value. With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\n\"\nI would like to thank Richard Hickinbotham for his leadership over the past nine years and for the wise counsel and steadfast support he has provided throughout his tenure, particularly as we navigated a number of challenges. His contribution as Chairman has been invaluable, and we wish him every success in his new role.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson / Phil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nAbout\u00a0Directa Plus\nDirecta Plus\u00a0(\nwww.directa-plus.com\n) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

Cash discipline remains a key priority, with management carefully balancing investment in growth with financial sustainability.\n* Contribution margin is a managerial metric calculated as (Revenue - Direct variable costs) / Revenue.\n**EBITDA loss represents results from operating activities before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation.\nOperational performance\n\u00b7\nProduction system upgrade nearing completion\n: the revamping of the Group's production line, due to be fully commissioned in Q4 2025, will deliver a fully automated and scalable facility capable of processing multiple precursors. It will also enable the production of nanographite-based materials, significantly reducing direct production costs, while enhanced automation and the switch from argon to nitrogen gas for the plasma process are expected to further lower production costs, improve sustainability and complete the process certification that will allow us to program licencing actions.\n\u00b7\nTalent and innovation\n: new hires in production and R&D are improving operational flexibility and accelerating innovation. This includes the development of new applications in elastomers, plastics, coatings and batteries, reinforcing the Group's ability to deliver scalable and customer-oriented solutions.\nEnvironmental remediation: 82% of period revenue (H1 2024: 81%)\n\u00b7\nSetcar restructuring has already translated into solid results in H1 2025, confirming the success of the turnaround plan launched in 2024.\n\u00b7\nNew project wins include a contract with Midia International SA (up to $1.5m) for offshore tank cleaning in the Black Sea and a \u20ac1.59m contract extension with OMV Petrom until 2026, albeit with the MIDIA project timetable revised to commence in Q1 2026, rather than Q4 2025, reflecting logistical complexities in relocating the offshore platform.\n\u00b7\nSeveral strategic contract renewals were secured, including Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem.\n\u00b7\nRenewal of the key Ford Otosan contract for Q4 2025 and 2026 remains pending, following an unexpectedly competitive process likely to lead to a lower contract value. Cost-optimisation measures are being implemented to mitigate the impact on margin in the event the contract is renewed.\nTextiles: 18% of period revenue (H1 2024: 19%)\n\u00b7\nEuropean textile market shows early signs of stabilisation, with further improvement expected in H2.\n\u00b7\nDirecta Plus continues to strengthen its position through collaborations in workwear, defence and luxury applications.\n\u00b7\nSignificant contract renewals were secured, including with Grassi and MC Armor. Post period, secured the first sole source contract by a primary governmental defence department.\n\u00b7\nThe distinctive properties of G+\u00ae - such as thermal conductivity, antistatic properties and antimicrobial effectiveness- remain highly valued by customers, with additional R&D work underway in niche applications such as electronic devices and air filtration.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nTrading in H2 started well, with commercial momentum built in H1 continuing into the second half.\n\u00b7\nThe upgraded production line will allow Directa Plus to target both high-value applications and cost-sensitive industrial sectors, opening entirely new market scenarios.\n\u00b7\nWhile Environmental Remediation and Textiles remain the pillars of the business today, the Board sees significant future value in the new verticals under development, supported by the Group's broad IP portfolio and accumulated graphene know-how.\n\u00b7\nThe Board remains confident that FY25 EBITDA will show a material year-on-year improvement, supported by the restructuring and efficiency measures already implemented and by solid commercial momentum. However, the scale of the 2025 progress is expected to be moderated by the revised timing of the MIDIA International project and by the pricing dynamics of the Ford renewal - subject to contract award - which will have an impact on the Group's FY25 forecasts\n.\nGiulio Cesareo, Founder & CEO of Directa Plus, said:\n\"The Group delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, underpinned by operational upgrades, the successful ongoing restructuring of Setcar, and continued commercial momentum. With the commissioning of our new production line in H2, enabling the launch of nanographite-based products alongside our premium G+\u00ae materials, we are well positioned to broaden our market reach and capture new growth opportunities. Supported by a strong pipeline in Environmental Remediation, a stabilising Textile division, and targeted R&D initiatives, the Board remains confident that FY25 will deliver a material year-on-year EBITDA improvement, laying the foundations for sustainable long-term growth.\"\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.directa-plus.com/\nor contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR and Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\nHannah Campbell\nRose Docherty\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nAbout Directa Plus\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets. The Company's graphene manufacturing capability uses proprietary patented technology based on a plasma super expansion process. Starting from natural graphite, each step of Directa Plus' production process - expansion, exfoliation and drying - creates graphene-based materials and hybrid graphene materials ready for a variety of uses and available in various forms such as powder, liquid and paste.\nThis proprietary production process uses a physical process, rather than a chemical process, to process graphite into pristine graphene nanoplatelets, which enables Directa Plus to offer a sustainable, non-toxic product, without unwanted by-products. Directa Plus' products are made of hybrid graphene materials and graphene nano-platelets. The products (marketed as G+\u00ae) have multiple applications due to its properties. These G+\u00ae products can be categorised into various families, with different products being suitable for specific practical applications.\nDirecta Plus was established in 2005 and is based in Lomazzo (Como, Italy) and has been listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange since May 2016.\u00a0The Company holds the Green Economy Mark from London Stock Exchange which recognises companies that contribute to the global green economy.\nChief Executive Officer's Statement\nOverview\nThe Group has delivered a solid performance in the first half, in line with management expectations, reflecting a focus on high-value contracts, strong cost control and operational efficiencies. This is largely due to the successful ongoing restructuring of the Group's Italian team and operations, and its environmental subsidiary, Setcar, which is progressing to plan.\nWe are laying the foundations for scalable growth through our investment in a next-generation production platform and the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio, which now includes 116 granted patents and 39 applications pending across 22 patent families. These advances reinforce our competitive positioning and ensure the Group is well placed to capture emerging market opportunities. In particular, the new production line will enable the introduction of nanographite-based materials and other product grades designed for both high-value and cost-sensitive applications, broadening our market reach and opening entirely new commercial scenarios for the Group.\nFinancial performance\nThe stronger H1 FY25 performance, marked by 15% revenue growth to \u20ac3.90m (H1 FY24: \u20ac3.39m) and a significant LBITDA improvement of 38% to \u20ac1.13m (H1 FY24: \u20ac1.81m), demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategic focus and disciplined cost management.\nManagement is actively prioritising higher-margin contracts, driving reductions in direct production costs, and maintaining close oversight of overheads while safeguarding the investments required to support long-term business growth. Cash monitoring remains critical, with management continually balancing the trade-off between funding growth initiatives and ensuring the overall sustainability of the business.\nReview of operations\nImportant upgrades to the Group's production system and capabilities are nearing completion, with full commissioning expected in Q4 2025. The revamped facility is now fully automated, capable of handling multiple precursors, and designed for scalability and replicability. These upgrades will enhance the Group's ability to deliver highly tailored materials at competitive cost, including for the first time nano-graphite and additives, to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nEntering the high-volume nano-graphite market will enable the Group to expand our addressable market volume by at least 10x and\nreinforce our service offering across strategic sectors that include elastomers, batteries, composites, paints, and cement, alongside strengthening established key customer relationships in the Environmental and Textile verticals. This flexibility will enable the Group to capture demand across a broader range of customer segments and market contexts.\nEnhanced levels of process automation and control,\nassociated with the investment programme, will also improve operational reliability, consistency and production capacity. As previously announced, the new system includes the replacement of argon gas with nitrogen gas as the main production energy source, delivering greater energy efficiency and cost savings, expected to cut direct production costs while improving sustainability.\nThe major reorganisation of Setcar's operations is progressing to plan. The restructuring has strengthened governance, streamlined operations, and created a more resilient and financially disciplined business. These improvements are reflected in a half-year performance that highlights a notable advance over the prior year with Setcar now better aligned with the Group's strategy and culture. Key steps included a governance restructuring with a new General Manager, workforce optimisation to eliminate inefficiencies, and the termination of low-margin contracts - allowing Setcar to focus on high-value projects and the commercial rollout of Grafysorber\u00ae. This alignment also ensures that Setcar can support the Group's broader objectives, including innovation, market expansion, and the delivery of high-value contracts across key strategic sectors.\nEnvironmental remediation\n(82% of revenue)\nThe positive impact of Setcar's restructuring is already visible, with the Romanian subsidiary delivering solid results in the first six months of 2025, both in terms of revenues and margins.\nThe Group secured\nseveral important contract renewals across its Environmental division, including those with Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem. Further contracts renewals are currently being discussed.\nAt the end of August 2025, Setcar was invited by Ford Otosan to submit an offer for services covering Q4 2025 and the whole of 2026. The renewal process has evolved into a highly competitive auction, requiring Setcar to revise its pricing downward to remain competitive. Setcar has submitted its offer and, as of the date of this announcement, no final decision has been communicated by Ford. The Company is closely monitoring developments and has prepared contingency plans for all potential outcomes, while already implementing measures identified to partially recover margins should the contract be renewed under the revised terms.\nIn the period, Setcar secured initial agreements with Midia International SA, worth up to $1.5 million, to provide tank cleaning and waste disposal services as part of an offshore drilling campaign in the Black Sea, specifically the Trident EX30 block. The project will involve the use of Directa Plus's proprietary Grafysorber\u00ae technology to treat the contaminated water. The operations are most likely now expected to commence in Q1 2026, compared with the original plan to start and complete in Q4 2025. The delay is due to logistical complexities related to relocating the offshore platform in the Black Sea from the Middle East. The contract remains fully valid and unchanged in scope and value, but the revised timetable will shift the related revenue and profit contribution to next year.\nThe Group also secured a \u20ac1.59 million contract extension with OMV Petrom to treat oil sludges, emulsions, and contaminated water, starting in H2 FY25. This contract extends the original framework agreement, which commenced in 2021 and has generated over \u20ac1.0 million in revenues to date, to 31 December 2026, ensuring the continuity of services without interruption.\nDuring H1, a distribution agreement was also signed\nwith a US based agent to enter the substantial environmental decontamination market in the United States. In Italy, commercial traction is also accelerating, with the main port authority for oil-based operations in the Port of Genoa endorsing Grafysorber\u00ae through increasing orders.\nThrough Setcar's restructuring, we are actively positioning ourselves to unlock additional opportunities, leveraging our proprietary environmental remediation technology and tapping into the substantial market potential ahead.\nTextiles (\n18\n% of revenue)\nThe European textiles market has faced challenges in recent years with weaker consumer spending causing a slow-down in the Group's revenues. We have gradually seen signs of improvement, with further stabilisation expected in H2. Additionally, the growing focus on sustainability and circular economy regulations presents opportunities for companies investing in innovation and responsible production. Against this backdrop, we remain committed to optimising our operations and leveraging market trends to strengthen our commercial position.\nWithin the textiles vertical, the Group's strategic positioning has strengthened, with advanced collaborations to take advantage of the growing pipeline in workwear, defence, and luxury applications. In H2, the Company secured significant contract renewals, including those with Grassi and MC Armor.\nPost period, Directa Plus has been awarded a contract by a sole source contract from a primary governmental defence department. The contract follows over two years of technical engagement and development activities in the defence sector, during which Directa Plus introduced and demonstrated as proof of concept the potential of several of its newly developed technologies. This award represents an initial phase of work, designed to validate the application of Directa Plus's graphene-based solutions. This milestone contract marks the first formal success of Directa Plus in this vertical and supports the Company's long-term strategy to expand its presence in the defence sector. The Company expects that, subject to the outcome of this initial phase, this project could lead to further commercial opportunities and revenue generation from its growing defence-focused technology platform.\nThe textile segment continues to show strong potential in applications where the distinctive properties of G+, such as thermal conductivity, antistatic and antimicrobial effectiveness, are highly valued by the market, particularly in workwear and defence. We are continuing to grow organically with both long-standing and new customers in these areas. At the same time, we are deepening our collaborations with leading luxury brands that recognise G+ as an innovative material for membranes across multiple uses, from outerwear to footwear. In parallel, R&D efforts are progressing on niche applications, including electronic devices and advanced air filtration.\nR&D and new applications\nIn parallel with the continued growth of our two core verticals - Environmental Remediation and Textiles - the Group is advancing several targeted R&D projects aimed at expanding the addressable market for our G+\u00ae technologies. These include, among the others:\n-\nPFAS remediation, where laboratory tests have shown up to 90% removal efficiency, with pilot-scale trials under discussion with industrial partners;\n-\nElastomers and plastics, with new G+\u00ae masterbatches and compounds developed for applications in tires, outsoles and advanced 3D printing;\n-\nOptical lenses, through collaborations to enhance infrared absorption and mechanical resistance;\n-\nAir filtration, with R&D work underway on advanced membranes capable of improving particle capture efficiency for industrial and consumer applications;\n-\nCoatings and cements, where the Group continues to monitor market developments and explore opportunities to apply G+\u00ae's functional properties.\n-\nEnergy, where we have an ongoing collaboration with Nant G+ Power focused on graphene-enhanced dispersions for next-generation battery electrodes.\nDirecta Plus is also adopting a consultancy-driven approach for valuable requests in verticals where the Company does not hold IP or has chosen not to invest. This strategy enables Directa Plus to capitalise on development opportunities by offering services and building customer loyalty for future production orders.\nTogether, these initiatives represent a strong pipeline of opportunities which, alongside our established verticals, are expected to create new revenue streams from 2026 onwards and reinforce the Group's long-term growth trajectory.\nPeople\nDirecta Plus continues to invest in talent, with new hires in production initiating a remodelling of the production line to increase productivity and ensure greater operational flexibility at lower direct production cost. In R&D, the Group has expanded its team and strengthened its capabilities to better align with evolving market needs and to drive innovation. These initiatives are designed to enhance the benefits of Directa Plus' technology and production process to deliver more effective, scalable and customer-oriented solutions.\nThe Board continues to monitor longer-term succession planning at Group level to ensure continuity of leadership and strategic direction.\nIP portfolio\nThe Group's broad intellectual property portfolio represents a significant hidden asset of the business, acting as a barrier to entry for potential competitors and providing strategic protection for our technologies. Together with the extensive know-how accumulated over years of research and industrial development in graphene, our IP portfolio is a cornerstone of future growth.\nWe are currently prioritising patents with the highest commercial potential, recognising that the breadth of our portfolio offers opportunities in multiple applications. Looking ahead, the Group expects to unlock further value from its IP base, including through potential licensing opportunities.\nOutlook\nThe Group delivered good commercial momentum in the first half of the year, with this positive trajectory continuing in H2. The international development in Environmental Remediation is progressing well, supported by a strong and growing pipeline of opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, and the US.\nThe upcoming production system upgrade will broaden the Group's product portfolio with advanced materials, opening access to new, high-value markets, drive efficiency and enable Directa Pls to launch a new generation of nanographite-based materials.\nAt the same time, R&D projects are progressing at pace beyond our two established verticals, targeting commercialisation in new markets.\nWhile Environmental Remediation and Textiles remain the pillars of our business today, the Board sees significant future value in the new verticals being developed through our R&D pipeline, which are expected to begin contributing meaningfully from 2026.\nNotwithstanding the temporary delays and uncertainties described above, the Board remains confident that the Group will close 2025 with a material improvement in EBITDA compared with 2024, reflecting the benefits of the restructuring and efficiency measures already implemented and the solid commercial momentum achieved during the year.\nGiulio Cesareo\nChief Executive Officer\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nIn

STATEMENTS\nFor the 6 months ended 30 June 2025\n1. Basis of preparation\n(a) Statement of compliance\nThe financial information contained in this announcement does not constitute statutory financial statements within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is unaudited. In the opinion of the Directors, the financial information for the period fairly represents the financial position of the Group. Results of operations and cash flows for the period are in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies, estimates and judgements applied are consistent with those disclosed in the Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the full annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nAll financial information is presented in Euro, unless otherwise disclosed.\nThe Directors of the Company approved the financial information included\nin these Interim condensed consolidated financial statements\non 23 September 2025.\n(b) Basis of measurement\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis unless otherwise stated.\n(c) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Euro ('\u20ac') and is considered by the Directors to be the most appropriate presentation currency to assist the users of the financial statements. The functional currency of the Company and Italian operating subsidiary is Euro ('\u20ac'). The functional currency of the Romanian subsidiary is RON.\n(d) Going concern\nThe Group meets its working capital requirements through the receipt of revenues from the provision of its services and sale of products mainly in Europe, the management of capital and operating expenditure, the working capital and other borrowing facilities available to it and from the issue of equity capital.\nThe conflict in Ukraine and Middle East, high inflation, increased tariffs in international trades and increased interest rates by the Central Banks have been an additional cause of uncertainty over the macro-economic outlook, affecting both the political and business environments. These events have had a significant impact on global economies and markets, and on the operations and operational funding of companies experiencing widespread inflationary cost pressures and supply chain disruption. In particular, certain sectors such as textiles and environmental services have been directly affected - the former by increased raw material and energy costs, and the latter by rising operational expenses and delays in public and private sector contracting - adding further pressure on businesses operating in these industries.\nThe Directors believe that the Group has the systems and protocols in place to address the challenges, however at the date of release of these interim results it is not clear how long the current circumstances are likely to last and what the long-term impact will be.\nAs of 30 June 2025, the Group had net assets of \u20ac5.46m (31 December 2024: \u20ac7.15m) and cash and cash equivalent of \u20ac2.97m (31 December 2024: \u20ac4.98m).\nThe Directors prepared a cash flow forecast for the Group and the Parent Company for the period to December 2026 to assess if there is sufficient liquidity in place to support the plan and strategy for the future development of the Group. This forecast showed that the Group and the Parent Company will have sufficient financial headroom for the next twelve months provided that certain growth objectives - which the Directors believe to be achievable - are delivered.\nIn addition, the Directors, in formulating the plan and strategy for the future development of the business, considered reasonably plausible downside scenarios including reductions in forecast revenues and gross margin. Under those stressed scenarios, the Group could exhaust its cash resources before December 2026 and therefore be required to raise additional funding which is not guaranteed.\nThese events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as going concern and therefore, the Group and the Parent Company may be unable to realise their assets or discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business. The Directors review regularly updates to the scenario planning such that it can put in place mitigating actions and maintain the viability of the company and will keep stakeholders informed as necessary.\nThe Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.\n2. Earnings Per Share\nThe earnings per share have been calculated using the weighted average of ordinary shares. The Company was loss making for all periods presented. Therefore, the dilutive effect of share options has not been taken account of in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, since this would decrease the loss per share for each of the period reported\n.\nChange in number of ordinary shares\nTotal number of ordinary shares\nDays\nWeighted number of ordinary shares\n-At 31 December 2021\n4,857,539\n66,032,126\n365\n61,380,599\n-At 31 December 2022\n25,523\n66,057,649\n365\n66,053,593\n-At 31 December 2023\n-\n66,057,648\n365\n66,057,649\n-At 31 December 2024\n38,361,106\n104,418,755\n365\n85,465,587\nAt 30 June 2025\n-\n104,418,755\n181\n104,418,755\n30 Jun 2025\n30 Jun 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nLoss for the period\n(1,651,981)\n(2,473,897)\n(3,140,237)\nWeighted average number of shares:\n- Basic\n104,418,755\n66,304,144\n85,465,588\n- Diluted\n105,446,938\n67,332,327\n86,493,771\nLoss per share:\n- Basic\n(0.02)\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n- Diluted\n(0.02)\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n-ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
