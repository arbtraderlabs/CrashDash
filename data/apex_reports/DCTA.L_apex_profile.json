Production enhancements to develop interlocked and blended graphene materials have broadened the portfolio, further enabling the Group to address high-growth applications including PFAS-related fields, defence and highly regulated industrial sectors. These important development come at the time when interest in the graphene market is growing exponentially as market participants look to incorporate graphene into existing products and products road maps.\nSetcar review and contract win\nManagement continues to focus on restructuring initiatives across Setcar, which has generated significant headcount reductions, operational efficiencies and margin improvements for at least \u20ac0.7m of annualised cost savings in FY25. Setcar is now better positioned to pursue opportunities within the strategically important Environmental Remediation market, underpinned by its technical expertise and extensive regulatory approvals.\nIn December 2025, Setcar won a competitive tender for a \u20ac1.5m Total Waste Management contract with Ford for a further 15 months. The company is now in the process of finalising the formal contract.\nWork to deliver further efficiencies at Setcar is progressing and the\u00a0Board will continue to evaluate the best options, improving overall capital allocation and how best to maximise shareholder value.\nSeparately, a process has commenced to realise the potential sale of non-strategic land held by Setcar, with an estimated value of at least \u20ac0.5m.\n2026 Outlook\nThe Board is laser focused on capturing high-growth graphene-based opportunities, monetising Directa's core IP, which remains protected by a substantial patent portfolio.\nThe Board continues to evaluate its options to realise value from this portfolio, including partnerships, joint ventures and licensing, and to assess its optimum options to secure the requisite funding which will be needed in FY26 to support future growth.\nThe Group closed FY25 with gross cash balances of \u20ac1.5m (FY24: \u20ac4.98m), providing a solid financial base going forward. Entering FY26, Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products.\nBoard changes\nRichard Hickinbotham, Non-Executive Chairman, who would have shortly completed his nine-year tenure with the Group, has informed the Board of his intention to take up a full-time executive role and will step down from the Board on 31 January 2026. Giulio Cesareo will assume the role of Interim plc Chairman with effect from that date.\nThe CEO succession process, as previously announced, is being progressed and a further update will be provided in due course.\nGiulio Cesareo, Chief Executive Officer at Directa Plus,\nsaid:\n\"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in EBITDA performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the Group. These actions have positioned us to better address high-growth, highly regulated markets where our graphene-based solutions have demonstrated clear added value. With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\n\"\nI would like to thank Richard Hickinbotham for his leadership over the past nine years and for the wise counsel and steadfast support he has provided throughout his tenure, particularly as we navigated a number of challenges. His contribution as Chairman has been invaluable, and we wish him every success in his new role.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson / Phil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nAbout\u00a0Directa Plus\nDirecta Plus\u00a0(\nwww.directa-plus.com\n) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

Cash discipline remains a key priority, with management carefully balancing investment in growth with financial sustainability.\n* Contribution margin is a managerial metric calculated as (Revenue - Direct variable costs) / Revenue.\n**EBITDA loss represents results from operating activities before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation.\nOperational performance\n\u00b7\nProduction system upgrade nearing completion\n: the revamping of the Group's production line, due to be fully commissioned in Q4 2025, will deliver a fully automated and scalable facility capable of processing multiple precursors. It will also enable the production of nanographite-based materials, significantly reducing direct production costs, while enhanced automation and the switch from argon to nitrogen gas for the plasma process are expected to further lower production costs, improve sustainability and complete the process certification that will allow us to program licencing actions.\n\u00b7\nTalent and innovation\n: new hires in production and R&D are improving operational flexibility and accelerating innovation. This includes the development of new applications in elastomers, plastics, coatings and batteries, reinforcing the Group's ability to deliver scalable and customer-oriented solutions.\nEnvironmental remediation: 82% of period revenue (H1 2024: 81%)\n\u00b7\nSetcar restructuring has already translated into solid results in H1 2025, confirming the success of the turnaround plan launched in 2024.\n\u00b7\nNew project wins include a contract with Midia International SA (up to $1.5m) for offshore tank cleaning in the Black Sea and a \u20ac1.59m contract extension with OMV Petrom until 2026, albeit with the MIDIA project timetable revised to commence in Q1 2026, rather than Q4 2025, reflecting logistical complexities in relocating the offshore platform.\n\u00b7\nSeveral strategic contract renewals were secured, including Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem.\n\u00b7\nRenewal of the key Ford Otosan contract for Q4 2025 and 2026 remains pending, following an unexpectedly competitive process likely to lead to a lower contract value. Cost-optimisation measures are being implemented to mitigate the impact on margin in the event the contract is renewed.\nTextiles: 18% of period revenue (H1 2024: 19%)\n\u00b7\nEuropean textile market shows early signs of stabilisation, with further improvement expected in H2.\n\u00b7\nDirecta Plus continues to strengthen its position through collaborations in workwear, defence and luxury applications.\n\u00b7\nSignificant contract renewals were secured, including with Grassi and MC Armor. Post period, secured the first sole source contract by a primary governmental defence department.\n\u00b7\nThe distinctive properties of G+\u00ae - such as thermal conductivity, antistatic properties and antimicrobial effectiveness- remain highly valued by customers, with additional R&D work underway in niche applications such as electronic devices and air filtration.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nTrading in H2 started well, with commercial momentum built in H1 continuing into the second half.\n\u00b7\nThe upgraded production line will allow Directa Plus to target both high-value applications and cost-sensitive industrial sectors, opening entirely new market scenarios.\n\u00b7\nWhile Environmental Remediation and Textiles remain the pillars of the business today, the Board sees significant future value in the new verticals under development, supported by the Group's broad IP portfolio and accumulated graphene know-how.\n\u00b7\nThe Board remains confident that FY25 EBITDA will show a material year-on-year improvement, supported by the restructuring and efficiency measures already implemented and by solid commercial momentum. However, the scale of the 2025 progress is expected to be moderated by the revised timing of the MIDIA International project and by the pricing dynamics of the Ford renewal - subject to contract award - which will have an impact on the Group's FY25 forecasts\n.\nGiulio Cesareo, Founder & CEO of Directa Plus, said:\n\"The Group delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, underpinned by operational upgrades, the successful ongoing restructuring of Setcar, and continued commercial momentum. With the commissioning of our new production line in H2, enabling the launch of nanographite-based products alongside our premium G+\u00ae materials, we are well positioned to broaden our market reach and capture new growth opportunities. Supported by a strong pipeline in Environmental Remediation, a stabilising Textile division, and targeted R&D initiatives, the Board remains confident that FY25 will deliver a material year-on-year EBITDA improvement, laying the foundations for sustainable long-term growth.\"\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.directa-plus.com/\nor contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR and Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\nHannah Campbell\nRose Docherty\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nAbout Directa Plus\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets. The Company's graphene manufacturing capability uses proprietary patented technology based on a plasma super expansion process. Starting from natural graphite, each step of Directa Plus' production process - expansion, exfoliation and drying - creates graphene-based materials and hybrid graphene materials ready for a variety of uses and available in various forms such as powder, liquid and paste.\nThis proprietary production process uses a physical process, rather than a chemical process, to process graphite into pristine graphene nanoplatelets, which enables Directa Plus to offer a sustainable, non-toxic product, without unwanted by-products. Directa Plus' products are made of hybrid graphene materials and graphene nano-platelets. The products (marketed as G+\u00ae) have multiple applications due to its properties. These G+\u00ae products can be categorised into various families, with different products being suitable for specific practical applications.\nDirecta Plus was established in 2005 and is based in Lomazzo (Como, Italy) and has been listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange since May 2016.\u00a0The Company holds the Green Economy Mark from London Stock Exchange which recognises companies that contribute to the global green economy.\nChief Executive Officer's Statement\nOverview\nThe Group has delivered a solid performance in the first half, in line with management expectations, reflecting a focus on high-value contracts, strong cost control and operational efficiencies. This is largely due to the successful ongoing restructuring of the Group's Italian team and operations, and its environmental subsidiary, Setcar, which is progressing to plan.\nWe are laying the foundations for scalable growth through our investment in a next-generation production platform and the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio, which now includes 116 granted patents and 39 applications pending across 22 patent families. These advances reinforce our competitive positioning and ensure the Group is well placed to capture emerging market opportunities. In particular, the new production line will enable the introduction of nanographite-based materials and other product grades designed for both high-value and cost-sensitive applications, broadening our market reach and opening entirely new commercial scenarios for the Group.\nFinancial performance\nThe stronger H1 FY25 performance, marked by 15% revenue growth to \u20ac3.90m (H1 FY24: \u20ac3.39m) and a significant LBITDA improvement of 38% to \u20ac1.13m (H1 FY24: \u20ac1.81m), demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategic focus and disciplined cost management.\nManagement is actively prioritising higher-margin contracts, driving reductions in direct production costs, and maintaining close oversight of overheads while safeguarding the investments required to support long-term business growth. Cash monitoring remains critical, with management continually balancing the trade-off between funding growth initiatives and ensuring the overall sustainability of the business.\nReview of operations\nImportant upgrades to the Group's production system and capabilities are nearing completion, with full commissioning expected in Q4 2025. The revamped facility is now fully automated, capable of handling multiple precursors, and designed for scalability and replicability. These upgrades will enhance the Group's ability to deliver highly tailored materials at competitive cost, including for the first time nano-graphite and additives, to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nEntering the high-volume nano-graphite market will enable the Group to expand our addressable market volume by at least 10x and\nreinforce our service offering across strategic sectors that include elastomers, batteries, composites, paints, and cement, alongside strengthening established key customer relationships in the Environmental and Textile verticals. This flexibility will enable the Group to capture demand across a broader range of customer segments and market contexts.\nEnhanced levels of process automation and control,\nassociated with the investment programme, will also improve operational reliability, consistency and production capacity. As previously announced, the new system includes the replacement of argon gas with nitrogen gas as the main production energy source, delivering greater energy efficiency and cost savings, expected to cut direct production costs while improving sustainability.\nThe major reorganisation of Setcar's operations is progressing to plan. The restructuring has strengthened governance, streamlined operations, and created a more resilient and financially disciplined business. These improvements are reflected in a half-year performance that highlights a notable advance over the prior year with Setcar now better aligned with the Group's strategy and culture. Key steps included a governance restructuring with a new General Manager, workforce optimisation to eliminate inefficiencies, and the termination of low-margin contracts - allowing Setcar to focus on high-value projects and the commercial rollout of Grafysorber\u00ae. This alignment also ensures that Setcar can support the Group's broader objectives, including innovation, market expansion, and the delivery of high-value contracts across key strategic sectors.\nEnvironmental remediation\n(82% of revenue)\nThe positive impact of Setcar's restructuring is already visible, with the Romanian subsidiary delivering solid results in the first six months of 2025, both in terms of revenues and margins.\nThe Group secured\nseveral important contract renewals across its Environmental division, including those with Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem. Further contracts renewals are currently being discussed.\nAt the end of August 2025, Setcar was invited by Ford Otosan to submit an offer for services covering Q4 2025 and the whole of 2026. The renewal process has evolved into a highly competitive auction, requiring Setcar to revise its pricing downward to remain competitive. Setcar has submitted its offer and, as of the date of this announcement, no final decision has been communicated by Ford. The Company is closely monitoring developments and has prepared contingency plans for all potential outcomes, while already implementing measures identified to partially recover margins should the contract be renewed under the revised terms.\nIn the period, Setcar secured initial agreements with Midia International SA, worth up to $1.5 million, to provide tank cleaning and waste disposal services as part of an offshore drilling campaign in the Black Sea, specifically the Trident EX30 block. The project will involve the use of Directa Plus's proprietary Grafysorber\u00ae technology to treat the contaminated water. The operations are most likely now expected to commence in Q1 2026, compared with the original plan to start and complete in Q4 2025. The delay is due to logistical complexities related to relocating the offshore platform in the Black Sea from the Middle East. The contract remains fully valid and unchanged in scope and value, but the revised timetable will shift the related revenue and profit contribution to next year.\nThe Group also secured a \u20ac1.59 million contract extension with OMV Petrom to treat oil sludges, emulsions, and contaminated water, starting in H2 FY25. This contract extends the original framework agreement, which commenced in 2021 and has generated over \u20ac1.0 million in revenues to date, to 31 December 2026, ensuring the continuity of services without interruption.\nDuring H1, a distribution agreement was also signed\nwith a US based agent to enter the substantial environmental decontamination market in the United States. In Italy, commercial traction is also accelerating, with the main port authority for oil-based operations in the Port of Genoa endorsing Grafysorber\u00ae through increasing orders.\nThrough Setcar's restructuring, we are actively positioning ourselves to unlock additional opportunities, leveraging our proprietary environmental remediation technology and tapping into the substantial market potential ahead.\nTextiles (\n18\n% of revenue)\nThe European textiles market has faced challenges in recent years with weaker consumer spending causing a slow-down in the Group's revenues. We have gradually seen signs of improvement, with further stabilisation expected in H2. Additionally, the growing focus on sustainability and circular economy regulations presents opportunities for companies investing in innovation and responsible production. Against this backdrop, we remain committed to optimising our operations and leveraging market trends to strengthen our commercial position.\nWithin the textiles vertical, the Group's strategic positioning has strengthened, with advanced collaborations to take advantage of the growing pipeline in workwear, defence, and luxury applications. In H2, the Company secured significant contract renewals, including those with Grassi and MC Armor.\nPost period, Directa Plus has been awarded a contract by a sole source contract from a primary governmental defence department. The contract follows over two years of technical engagement and development activities in the defence sector, during which Directa Plus introduced and demonstrated as proof of concept the potential of several of its newly developed technologies. This award represents an initial phase of work, designed to validate the application of Directa Plus's graphene-based solutions. This milestone contract marks the first formal success of Directa Plus in this vertical and supports the Company's long-term strategy to expand its presence in the defence sector. The Company expects that, subject to the outcome of this initial phase, this project could lead to further commercial opportunities and revenue generation from its growing defence-focused technology platform.\nThe textile segment continues to show strong potential in applications where the distinctive properties of G+, such as thermal conductivity, antistatic and antimicrobial effectiveness, are highly valued by the market, particularly in workwear and defence. We are continuing to grow organically with both long-standing and new customers in these areas. At the same time, we are deepening our collaborations with leading luxury brands that recognise G+ as an innovative material for membranes across multiple uses, from outerwear to footwear. In parallel, R&D efforts are progressing on niche applications, including electronic devices and advanced air filtration.\nR&D and new applications\nIn parallel with the continued growth of our two core verticals - Environmental Remediation and Textiles - the Group is advancing several targeted R&D projects aimed at expanding the addressable market for our G+\u00ae technologies. These include, among the others:\n-\nPFAS remediation, where laboratory tests have shown up to 90% removal efficiency, with pilot-scale trials under discussion with industrial partners;\n-\nElastomers and plastics, with new G+\u00ae masterbatches and compounds developed for applications in tires, outsoles and advanced 3D printing;\n-\nOptical lenses, through collaborations to enhance infrared absorption and mechanical resistance;\n-\nAir filtration, with R&D work underway on advanced membranes capable of improving particle capture efficiency for industrial and consumer applications;\n-\nCoatings and cements, where the Group continues to monitor market developments and explore opportunities to apply G+\u00ae's functional properties.\n-\nEnergy, where we have an ongoing collaboration with Nant G+ Power focused on graphene-enhanced dispersions for next-generation battery electrodes.\nDirecta Plus is also adopting a consultancy-driven approach for valuable requests in verticals where the Company does not hold IP or has chosen not to invest. This strategy enables Directa Plus to capitalise on development opportunities by offering services and building customer loyalty for future production orders.\nTogether, these initiatives represent a strong pipeline of opportunities which, alongside our established verticals, are expected to create new revenue streams from 2026 onwards and reinforce the Group's long-term growth trajectory.\nPeople\nDirecta Plus continues to invest in talent, with new hires in production initiating a remodelling of the production line to increase productivity and ensure greater operational flexibility at lower direct production cost. In R&D, the Group has expanded its team and strengthened its capabilities to better align with evolving market needs and to drive innovation. These initiatives are designed to enhance the benefits of Directa Plus' technology and production process to deliver more effective, scalable and customer-oriented solutions.\nThe Board continues to monitor longer-term succession planning at Group level to ensure continuity of leadership and strategic direction.\nIP portfolio\nThe Group's broad intellectual property portfolio represents a significant hidden asset of the business, acting as a barrier to entry for potential competitors and providing strategic protection for our technologies. Together with the extensive know-how accumulated over years of research and industrial development in graphene, our IP portfolio is a cornerstone of future growth.\nWe are currently prioritising patents with the highest commercial potential, recognising that the breadth of our portfolio offers opportunities in multiple applications. Looking ahead, the Group expects to unlock further value from its IP base, including through potential licensing opportunities.\nOutlook\nThe Group delivered good commercial momentum in the first half of the year, with this positive trajectory continuing in H2. The international development in Environmental Remediation is progressing well, supported by a strong and growing pipeline of opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, and the US.\nThe upcoming production system upgrade will broaden the Group's product portfolio with advanced materials, opening access to new, high-value markets, drive efficiency and enable Directa Pls to launch a new generation of nanographite-based materials.\nAt the same time, R&D projects are progressing at pace beyond our two established verticals, targeting commercialisation in new markets.\nWhile Environmental Remediation and Textiles remain the pillars of our business today, the Board sees significant future value in the new verticals being developed through our R&D pipeline, which are expected to begin contributing meaningfully from 2026.\nNotwithstanding the temporary delays and uncertainties described above, the Board remains confident that the Group will close 2025 with a material improvement in EBITDA compared with 2024, reflecting the benefits of the restructuring and efficiency measures already implemented and the solid commercial momentum achieved during the year.\nGiulio Cesareo\nChief Executive Officer\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nIn

STATEMENTS\nFor the 6 months ended 30 June 2025\n1. Basis of preparation\n(a) Statement of compliance\nThe financial information contained in this announcement does not constitute statutory financial statements within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is unaudited. In the opinion of the Directors, the financial information for the period fairly represents the financial position of the Group. Results of operations and cash flows for the period are in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies, estimates and judgements applied are consistent with those disclosed in the Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the full annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nAll financial information is presented in Euro, unless otherwise disclosed.\nThe Directors of the Company approved the financial information included\nin these Interim condensed consolidated financial statements\non 23 September 2025.\n(b) Basis of measurement\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis unless otherwise stated.\n(c) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Euro ('\u20ac') and is considered by the Directors to be the most appropriate presentation currency to assist the users of the financial statements. The functional currency of the Company and Italian operating subsidiary is Euro ('\u20ac'). The functional currency of the Romanian subsidiary is RON.\n(d) Going concern\nThe Group meets its working capital requirements through the receipt of revenues from the provision of its services and sale of products mainly in Europe, the management of capital and operating expenditure, the working capital and other borrowing facilities available to it and from the issue of equity capital.\nThe conflict in Ukraine and Middle East, high inflation, increased tariffs in international trades and increased interest rates by the Central Banks have been an additional cause of uncertainty over the macro-economic outlook, affecting both the political and business environments. These events have had a significant impact on global economies and markets, and on the operations and operational funding of companies experiencing widespread inflationary cost pressures and supply chain disruption. In particular, certain sectors such as textiles and environmental services have been directly affected - the former by increased raw material and energy costs, and the latter by rising operational expenses and delays in public and private sector contracting - adding further pressure on businesses operating in these industries.\nThe Directors believe that the Group has the systems and protocols in place to address the challenges, however at the date of release of these interim results it is not clear how long the current circumstances are likely to last and what the long-term impact will be.\nAs of 30 June 2025, the Group had net assets of \u20ac5.46m (31 December 2024: \u20ac7.15m) and cash and cash equivalent of \u20ac2.97m (31 December 2024: \u20ac4.98m).\nThe Directors prepared a cash flow forecast for the Group and the Parent Company for the period to December 2026 to assess if there is sufficient liquidity in place to support the plan and strategy for the future development of the Group. This forecast showed that the Group and the Parent Company will have sufficient financial headroom for the next twelve months provided that certain growth objectives - which the Directors believe to be achievable - are delivered.\nIn addition, the Directors, in formulating the plan and strategy for the future development of the business, considered reasonably plausible downside scenarios including reductions in forecast revenues and gross margin. Under those stressed scenarios, the Group could exhaust its cash resources before December 2026 and therefore be required to raise additional funding which is not guaranteed.\nThese events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as going concern and therefore, the Group and the Parent Company may be unable to realise their assets or discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business. The Directors review regularly updates to the scenario planning such that it can put in place mitigating actions and maintain the viability of the company and will keep stakeholders informed as necessary.\nThe Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.\n2. Earnings Per Share\nThe earnings per share have been calculated using the weighted average of ordinary shares. The Company was loss making for all periods presented. Therefore, the dilutive effect of share options has not been taken account of in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, since this would decrease the loss per share for each of the period reported\n.\nChange in number of ordinary shares\nTotal number of ordinary shares\nDays\nWeighted number of ordinary shares\n-At 31 December 2021\n4,857,539\n66,032,126\n365\n61,380,599\n-At 31 December 2022\n25,523\n66,057,649\n365\n66,053,593\n-At 31 December 2023\n-\n66,057,648\n365\n66,057,649\n-At 31 December 2024\n38,361,106\n104,418,755\n365\n85,465,587\nAt 30 June 2025\n-\n104,418,755\n181\n104,418,755\n30 Jun 2025\n30 Jun 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nLoss for the period\n(1,651,981)\n(2,473,897)\n(3,140,237)\nWeighted average number of shares:\n- Basic\n104,418,755\n66,304,144\n85,465,588\n- Diluted\n105,446,938\n67,332,327\n86,493,771\nLoss per share:\n- Basic\n(0.02)\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n- Diluted\n(0.02)\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n-ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Production enhancements to develop interlocked and blended graphene materials have broadened the portfolio, further enabling the Group to address high-growth applications including PFAS-related fields, defence and highly regulated industrial sectors. These important development come at the time when interest in the graphene market is growing exponentially as market participants look to incorporate graphene into existing products and products road maps.\nSetcar review and contract win\nManagement continues to focus on restructuring initiatives across Setcar, which has generated significant headcount reductions, operational efficiencies and margin improvements for at least \u20ac0.7m of annualised cost savings in FY25. Setcar is now better positioned to pursue opportunities within the strategically important Environmental Remediation market, underpinned by its technical expertise and extensive regulatory approvals.\nIn December 2025, Setcar won a competitive tender for a \u20ac1.5m Total Waste Management contract with Ford for a further 15 months. The company is now in the process of finalising the formal contract.\nWork to deliver further efficiencies at Setcar is progressing and the\u00a0Board will continue to evaluate the best options, improving overall capital allocation and how best to maximise shareholder value.\nSeparately, a process has commenced to realise the potential sale of non-strategic land held by Setcar, with an estimated value of at least \u20ac0.5m.\n2026 Outlook\nThe Board is laser focused on capturing high-growth graphene-based opportunities, monetising Directa's core IP, which remains protected by a substantial patent portfolio.\nThe Board continues to evaluate its options to realise value from this portfolio, including partnerships, joint ventures and licensing, and to assess its optimum options to secure the requisite funding which will be needed in FY26 to support future growth.\nThe Group closed FY25 with gross cash balances of \u20ac1.5m (FY24: \u20ac4.98m), providing a solid financial base going forward. Entering FY26, Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products.\nBoard changes\nRichard Hickinbotham, Non-Executive Chairman, who would have shortly completed his nine-year tenure with the Group, has informed the Board of his intention to take up a full-time executive role and will step down from the Board on 31 January 2026. Giulio Cesareo will assume the role of Interim plc Chairman with effect from that date.\nThe CEO succession process, as previously announced, is being progressed and a further update will be provided in due course.\nGiulio Cesareo, Chief Executive Officer at Directa Plus,\nsaid:\n\"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in EBITDA performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the Group. These actions have positioned us to better address high-growth, highly regulated markets where our graphene-based solutions have demonstrated clear added value. With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\n\"\nI would like to thank Richard Hickinbotham for his leadership over the past nine years and for the wise counsel and steadfast support he has provided throughout his tenure, particularly as we navigated a number of challenges. His contribution as Chairman has been invaluable, and we wish him every success in his new role.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Br",

Cash discipline remains a key priority, with management carefully balancing investment in growth with financial sustainability.\n* Contribution margin is a managerial metric calculated as (Revenue - Direct variable costs) / Revenue.\n**EBITDA loss represents results from operating activities before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation.\nOperational performance\n\u00b7\nProduction system upgrade nearing completion\n: the revamping of the Group's production line, due to be fully commissioned in Q4 2025, will deliver a fully automated and scalable facility capable of processing multiple precursors. It will also enable the production of nanographite-based materials, significantly reducing direct production costs, while enhanced automation and the switch from argon to nitrogen gas for the plasma process are expected to further lower production costs, improve sustainability and complete the process certification that will allow us to program licencing actions.\n\u00b7\nTalent and innovation\n: new hires in production and R&D are improving operational flexibility and accelerating innovation. This includes the development of new applications in elastomers, plastics, coatings and batteries, reinforcing the Group's ability to deliver scalable and customer-oriented solutions.\nEnvironmental remediation: 82% of period revenue (H1 2024: 81%)\n\u00b7\nSetcar restructuring has already translated into solid results in H1 2025, confirming the success of the turnaround plan launched in 2024.\n\u00b7\nNew project wins include a contract with Midia International SA (up to $1.5m) for offshore tank cleaning in the Black Sea and a \u20ac1.59m contract extension with OMV Petrom until 2026, albeit with the MIDIA project timetable revised to commence in Q1 2026, rather than Q4 2025, reflecting logistical complexities in relocating the offshore platform.\n\u00b7\nSeveral strategic contract renewals were secured, including Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem.\n\u00b7\nRenewal of the key Ford Otosan contract for Q4 2025 and 2026 remains pending, following an unexpectedly competitive process likely to lead to a lower contract value. Cost-optimisation measures are being implemented to mitigate the impact on margin in the event the contract is renewed.\nTextiles: 18% of period revenue (H1 2024: 19%)\n\u00b7\nEuropean textile market shows early signs of stabilisation, with further improvement expected in H2.\n\u00b7\nDirecta Plus continues to strengthen its position through collaborations in workwear, defence and luxury applications.\n\u00b7\nSignificant contract renewals were secured, including with Grassi and MC Armor. Post period, secured the first sole source contract by a primary governmental defence department.\n\u00b7\nThe distinctive properties of G+\u00ae - such as thermal conductivity, antistatic properties and antimicrobial effectiveness- remain highly valued by customers, with additional R&D work underway in niche applications such as electronic devices and air filtration.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nTrading in H2 started well, with commercial momentum built in H1 continuing into the second half.\n\u00b7\nThe upgraded production line will allow Directa Plus to target both high-value applications and cost-sensitive industrial sectors, opening entirely new market scenarios.\n\u00b7\nWhile Environmental Remediation and Textiles remain the pillars of the business today, the Board sees significant future value in the new verticals under development, supported by the Group's broad IP portfolio and accumulated graphene know-how.\n\u00b7\nThe Board remains confident that FY25 EBITDA will show a material year-on-year improvement, supported by the restructuring and efficiency measures already implemented and by solid commercial momentum. However, the scale of the 2025 progress is expected to be moderated by the revised timing of the MIDIA International project and by the pricing dynamics of the Ford renewal - subject to contract award - which will have an impact on the Group's FY25 forecasts\n.\nGiulio Cesareo, Founder & CEO of Directa Plus, said:\n\"The Group delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, underpinned by operational upgrades, ",

The major reorganisation of Setcar's operations is progressing to plan, delivering a more resilient and financially disciplined operation and a half-year performance that is a significant improvement on the prior year.\nThe first half has seen the Group secure\nseveral important contract renewals across its Environmental and Textiles divisions, including those with Grassi, MC Armor, Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem. Setcar also secured initial agreements with Midia International SA, worth up to $1.5m, and a \u20ac1.59m contract extension with OMV Petrom, for the use of the Group's patented Grafysorber\u00ae technology to treat oil sludges, emulsions, and contaminated water, starting in H2 FY25.\nDuring the second quarter a distribution agreement was also signed\nwith a US based agent to enter the substantial environmental decontamination market in the United States.\nImportant upgrades to the Group's production system and capabilities are set to be fully operational in September 2025. These upgrades will enhance the Group's ability to deliver highly tailored materials at competitive cost, including for the first time nano-graphite and additives, to customers that can meet their broader and growing commercial needs.\nAccessing the high-volume nano-graphite market will enable the Group to expand its addressable market volume by at least 10x and\nreinforce its service offering across strategic sectors that include elastomers, batteries, composites, paints, and cement, alongside strengthening key customer relationships in the Environmental and Textile verticals.\nEnhanced levels of process automation and control,\nassociated with the investment programme, will also improve operational reliability, consistency and production capacity. As previously announced, the new system includes the replacement of argon gas with nitrogen gas as the main production energy source, delivering greater energy efficiency and cost benefit.\nOverall, the Group is pleased to report that momentum is rebuilding with higher\nenquiry levels, new contract wins and renewals, supported by a clear focus on reducing the Group's cost structure and broadening its addressable markets. The Board remains confident of meeting market expectations for Adjusted LBITDA in FY25\u00b9.\nGiulio Cesareo, Chief Executive Officer at Directa Plus,\nsaid:\n\"Our stronger H1 FY25 performance, marked by revenue growth and a significant LBITDA improvement, demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategic focus and disciplined cost management. Building on continued contract wins across our key markets, operational efficiencies, and targeted capital investment, we\nanticipate stronger growth in the second half of the year, as has consistently been the case, and we are seeing significant and promising pipeline of opportunities.\n\"\nNotice of results\nThe Company expects to announce its unaudited half year results for the six months to 30 June 2025 on 24 September 2025.\n1.Directa understands that as at the date of this announcement, market expectations for the year ended\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0are an Adjusted LBITDA of\u00a0(E1.7m).\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nHannah Campbell\nKinvara Verdon\nAbout\u00a0Directa Plus\nDirecta Plus\u00a0(\nwww.directa-plus.com\n) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

This improvement has been primarily driven by several contract renewals across the Environmental and Textiles divisions, including with Grassi, Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem. The Group's current order book stands at approximately \u20ac7 million for FY2025, supported further by a good pipeline of opportunities. As part of this positive momentum, Setcar announced an initial agreement with Midia International SA, worth up to $1.5 million in February 2025, to provide tank cleaning and waste disposal services for an offshore drilling campaign in the Black Sea. Group cash is approximately \u20ac4 million at the end of March 2025.\nThe Group expects to announce its audited results for FY2024 in mid-May 2025 and to report, subject to audit, an adjusted LBITDA of c. \u20ac3.6 million, in line with market expectations\u00b9, from revenues of approximately \u20ac6.7m (FY23: \u20ac10.53).\nOperational Update\nThe Board is pleased to report that it has delivered\napproximately \u20ac0.5 million of targeted annualised cost savings through the identification of\nseveral operational improvements and efficiencies across the Group, which will be reflected in FY2025. As a result of this process,\nfurther potential savings are also now being targeted.\nAs part of the new strategic focus at Setcar, following the acquisition of full majority control in FY2024, the Board has implemented a headcount reduction and appointed a new General Manager to bring improved focus and leadership. Additionally, in line with this reorganisation, there is a process for further senior appointments in place, including a new Sales Director, to strengthen Setcar's commercial capabilities and support future growth.\nAt the Lomazzo plant, management have enhanced the production team, which is currently working on a remodelling of the production line aimed at both increasing productivity and ensuring greater operational flexibility at significantly lower direct production costs. In parallel, specific investments to further improve the production line have been undertaken, including the substitution of argon gas with nitrogen as the main energy source which has already reduced production costs with additional benefits in terms of sustainability.\nThe Group has also strengthened the R&D team to better align with evolving market needs and to drive innovation both in the short term and across medium-to-long-term strategic verticals.\nOutlook\nThe Group has made a positive start to FY2025\nand continues to see new tangible opportunities in environmental remediation, textiles and in further verticals, such as asphalts, tyres, batteries and paints. It has also launched a joint R&D activity with Nant G Power to explore new battery materials, which, if successful, could lead to a broader collaboration agreement.\nGiulio Cesareo, Founder & CEO of Directa Plus, said:\n\"We are working with determination to recover the ground lost in 2024 and to bring the Group back to its expected growth path. At the same time, we are moving decisively on two key fronts. First, the significant reorganisation of Setcar, including the appointment of a new General Manager, a new Sales Director, and the addition of new executives within the Group, will allow us to capture new business opportunities and eliminate inefficiencies. Second, we are redesigning the layout of the Lomazzo plant to enhance production flexibility and achieve significant cost reductions. This lays the foundation for the Group to build momentum which is already evident from the new wins and renewals in the first quarter of FY2025, providing confidence in the success of our strategy.\"\n1.\u00a0Directa Plus understands that as at the date of this announcement, market expectations for the year ended\u00a031 December 2024\u00a0are an adjusted LBITDA of\n\u20ac\n3.4m.

This innovative approach effectively removes oil contaminants, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and contributing to sustainable practices in offshore operations.\nContract renewal with Ford Otosan\nSetcar renewed its contract with its long-standing client, Ford Otosan, an automotive business in Romania owned by Ford Motor Company, for the sixth time, for c. \u20ac1.1 million. Setcar will continue to deliver Total Waste Management services, including waste disposal, transportation, treatment, recycling, equipment, and personnel.\nGiulio Cesareo, Founder & CEO of Directa Plus, said:\n\"We are seeing traction build in Environmental contracts, with both new and long-standing clients. These contract wins are testament to the value delivered by Setcar's innovative solutions and the Group's growing pipeline of opportunities.

The products (marketed as G+(R)) have multiple applications due to its properties. These G+(R) products can be categorised into various families, with different products being suitable for specific practical applications.\nDirecta Plus was established in 2005 and is based in Lomazzo (Como, Italy) and has been listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange since May 2016. Directa Plus holds the Green Economy Mark from London Stock Exchange which recognises companies that contribute to the global green economy.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

There is no certainty that other funding would be available on suitable terms or at all. Accordingly, in light of the Group's cash position, it would be likely that the Company would have to severely restrict its costs, potentially impacting its ability to progress its growth strategy and generate value for the Group.\nThe Company has been notified that certain existing shareholders, with a combined shareholding of approximately 19.82 per cent. of the Company, intend to vote against the Resolutions. The Board believes this action jeopardises the future viability of the business and will have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, prospects, capital resources, cash flows, share price, liquidity, results and/or future operations. Accordingly, the Board will have no alternative but to seek other, emergency, forms of funding (which, if available, may be on terms significantly less favourable to the Company and its Shareholders) or to take steps to preserve and maximise value for its creditors.\nAccordingly, the Board reiterates its unanimous recommendation that all Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions.\nThe General Meeting to approve the Resolutions is expected to be held at the offices of Vistra, 7th Floor, 50 Broadway, London SW1H 0DB at 2.30 p.m. (BST) on 27 June 2024.\nShareholders are required to vote in favour of the resolutions for the Fundraise to proceed and have until 2.30 p.m. on 25 June 2024 to submit valid Forms of Proxy.\nTo be valid, a Proxy Vote must be received by the shareholder portal at\nwww.signalshares.com\n, via the LinkVote+ app, in the case of shares held through CREST, via the CREST system or, if you are an institutional investor you may also be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform. If you wish to receive a hard copy form of proxy, you may request one directly from the Registrars, Link Group, using the contact details provided in Note 5 to the Notice of the General Meeting.\nPlease Note: Nominees and Brokers may have earlier internal deadlines, therefore it is recommended that all Shareholders lodge their instructions as early as possible in order to assure their vote is placed on time.\nCapitalised terms not otherwise defined in the text of this Announcement have the meanings given in the Circular published on 11 June 2024.\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 131 220 6939\nNeil McDonald\nAdam Rae\nSinger Capital Markets Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nHannah Campbell\nKinvara Verdon\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this Announcement on behalf of the Company is Giorgio Bonfanti, Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nNotes to Editors\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

As the Company is currently in a close period under MAR until the publication of its full year results for the period ended 31 December 2023 (\"\nResults\n\"), the Directors are not permitted to enter into any arrangement until after publication of the Results (and subject to each not being in possession of any other unpublished price sensitive information at such time).

Should the Directors' Intended Participation be confirmed upon publication of Results the gross proceeds of the Fundraising will be approximately \u00a36.9 million.\nThe New Ordinary Shares (including the Directors' Intended Participation) will represent in aggregate 36.7 per cent. of the Company's Enlarged Issued Share Capital following Admission (assuming the Directors' Intended Participation proceeds).\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited and Singer Capital Markets Securities Limited acted as joint brokers in connection with the Bookbuild.\nThe Placing and the issue of the New Ordinary Shares are conditional upon, amongst other things:\n\u00b7\nthe passing of the Resolutions without amendment to be proposed at the General Meeting;\n\u00b7\nthe Placing Agreement having become unconditional (save for Admission) and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to Admission;\n\u00b7\nthe allotment of the EIS/VCT Placing Shares in advance of the allotment of the Non-EIS/VCT Placing Shares; and\n\u00b7\nAdmission taking place by no later than 8.00 a.m. on 1 July 2024 (or such later date as the Joint Brokers may agree in writing with the Company, being not later than 8.00 a.m. on 15 July 2024).\nRule 9 Waiver\nFollowing completion of the Fundraising, Nant Capital, LLC will be interested (for the purpose of the City Code) in Ordinary Shares carrying 30 per cent. or more of the Company's voting share capital, which would ordinarily result in Nant Capital, LLC having to make a mandatory offer under Rule 9 of the City Code.\nHowever, the Panel has agreed to waive the obligation on Nant Capital, LLC (or any person acting in concert with it) to make a mandatory cash offer under Rule 9 of the City Code that woul",

The product uses graphene supplied by Directa Plus alongside hard-to-recycle plastics, such as certain types of toys, fruit crates, and old CD cases that would not normally be recycled. The asphalt containing GiPave\u00ae can itself be entirely recycled, further reducing waste and the need for new materials.\nThe access road paving to the paddocks at Imola, which experiences the highest volume of heavy vehicles and people at race events, has been resurfaced with GiPave\u00ae, guaranteeing higher performance in terms of resistance and durability, extending the pavement's life beyond the best technologies currently available on the market and significantly reducing environmental impacts thanks to lower maintenance requirements.\nThe use of GiPave\u00ae also reduces energy and raw materials consumption. Over the useful life of the pavement, the installation of GiPave\u00ae is expected to result in savings including more than 78,000 kg of bitumen, 1.623 million kg of aggregates (equivalent to the weight of 955 cars), about 115 truck trips for transporting materials, over 1,182,125 kWh of energy (equal to the monthly needs of approximately 5,254 families), and 74,000 kg of CO2eq (equivalent to the absorption capacity of about 3,000 adult trees in a year). In addition, 3,700 kg of selected hard recycled plastics have been recovered and repurposed.\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO of Directa Plus, commented\n:\n\"\nI am thrilled to see that the Imola Circuit is now the first in the world to implement an innovative, green asphalt solution incorporating our Graphene Plus\u00ae, thanks to our partnership with Iterchimica. This project underlines the limitless applications of Gipave-from bridges and motorways to airports and now race tracks. The outstanding properties of Graphene Plus continue to pave the way for more sustainable infrastructure globally.\n\"Iterchimica and Directa Plus are pushing the boundaries of technology and sustainability and we are delighted to be collaborating with the Group with which we with share the same goal to build a greener future.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 131 220 6939\nNeil McDonald\nAdam Rae\nSinger Capital Markets Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nHannah Campbell\nKinvara Verdon\nNotes to Editors\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

(\"Setcar\"), has secured a three-year contract with LIBERTY Galati, the largest integrated steel producer in Romania, to provide a solution for the treatment of oily mills scale produced in the manufacturing of steel. The waste of rolling production is a mill scale (iron oxides) which is formed on the\nrolled product; this occurs when billets, heated to almost 1000C, pass through the rolling mill and come into contact with oxygen, oil and coolant water.\nDuring the complete rolling process, about 2.5% of the metal weight of the workpiece is slagged.\nThis multi-year contract has a total value of \u20ac5.5 million, with the potential for further expansion up to a total value of \u20ac8.0 million depending on rolling mills monthly production volume. Setcar's solution offered to LIBERTY Galati further leverages the use of Directa's patented Grafysorber\u00ae technology.\nThe Group's Grafysorber\u00ae technology provides a unique method for the removal and recovery of oil compounds from the mill sludge and facilitates the recycling of a waste product that is otherwise extremely difficult to treat. Setcar's unique processing system will enable LIBERTY Galati to convert a significant quantity of oily sludge waste into a raw material that can be re-utilised in its steel production process.\nThis contract, which was awarded following a public tender process, will enable Setcar to expand further its waste treatment and disposal services for industrial pollutants and broaden the range of applications for the Group's Grafysorber\u00ae technology.\nGrafysorber\u00ae technology is a hybrid graphene-based solution for treating water sludges and emulsions containing hydrocarbons. It is at least five times more effective than current technologies, absorbing more than 100 times its own weight of oil-based pollutants. In addition, Grafysorber\u00ae is sustainably produced, non-flammable and reusable, with the adsorbed hydrocarbons recoverable.\nCommenting, Giulio Cesareo, Founder and CEO of Directa Plus, said\n:\n\"We are very proud of this achievement. This is the largest single contract signed by the Group to date equivalent to the 2020 yearly company turnover. Securing a multi-year contract with LIBERTY Galati is a very exciting win and demonstrates the building momentum for the Group's products and solutions. We are targeting a new significant application for Grafysorber\n\u00ae\nwith a very large global potential market.\nWe look forward to working with LIBERTY Galati and showcasing the compelling advantages of Grafysorber\n\u00ae\nand Setcar's solution for oily mill scale produced in steel making.\"\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.directa-plus.com/\nor contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nCenkos Securities plc\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 131 220 6939\nNeil McDonald\nAdam Rae\nSinger Capital Markets Securities Limited\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma PR\n(Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\ndirectaplus@almapr.co.uk\nHannah Campbell\nKinvara Verdon\nNotes to Editors\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

This award will enable Directa Plus to continue investing and developing its air filter applications, leveraging the antiviral and antimicrobial properties of its G+ technologies.\nIt is proven that the G+ filter has a bacterial load reduction higher than 99.98% and, when tested in conditions of simulated use, it is three times more efficient than the average alternative products on the market. Moreover, Graphene Plus is free from any hazard identification, being the G+ technology which is non-toxic and safe for both humans and the environment.\nDirecta Plus has been working on the development of G+ air filters since 2020 following the rapid and successful commercialisation of a high performing graphene-based mask, the Co-Mask, to contribute to the fight against Covid-19. This quickly led to exploring industrial filtration applications in the automotive industry and Directa Plus will now use the funding to target Industrial Heating, Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) applications.\nBased on recent research by Fortune Business Insights, the global air filters market size was valued at $14.68 billion in 2022 and it is projected to grow to $25.69 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.3% over those years.\nThe Ricerca & Innova programme aims to support investments in industrial research, experimental development and process innovation by companies based in Lombardy. Directa Plus was selected as part of the programme, among many other participants, due to the innovative capabilities of the Group's G+ technologies and timing of the submission.\nCommenting, Giulio Cesareo, Founder and CEO of Directa Plus, said\n:\n\"We are excited to have been awarded this project tender by the Lombardy local government which recognises our commitment to innovation and developing advanced technologies. It will enable Directa Plus to further invest in and develop an innovative product enhanced by the unique properties of Graphene Plus at a faster rate than previously possible and strengthen our position in fast growing markets.

This is key to the Group's IP strategy as plasma technology sits at the core of Directa Plus' unique production process and is what distinguishes the Company from its competitors. Through its plasma technology, Directa Plus generates super-expanded graphite\n(Grafysorber\u00ae) with unique properties and performances in a chemical-free process.\nThe EP patent is the technical evolution of the patent for 'production of nano-structures', and covers\nall the engineering improvements made to the plasma system to enhance the performance of the technology in terms of yields and the quality of the super expanded graphite obtained.\nThe patent priority date is 19 December 2018.\nET Patent\nCovers the composition for treating textile articles and is a further evolution of the use of G+ in textiles, expanding the Group's patent coverage in textile applications. It covers a 100% natural and environmentally sustainable printing paste enhanced by graphene's antimicrobial, electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The patent also protects textile articles treated with the composition, including manufactured products for personal health protection.\nThe natural make-up of this composition firmly aligns with Directa Plus' focus on sustainability and environmental protection.\nT\nhe patent priority date is the 4 May 2021.\nCommenting, Giulio Cesareo, Founder and CEO of Directa Plus, said\n:\n\"Receiving a further two patents has not only strengthened Directa Plus' IP portfolio but demonstrates the ability of our graphene technology to be used across a range of applications and reinforces our position in fast growing markets. As we look to further our competitive advantage, we will continue to aggressively expand our portfolio, covering both technology and applications.\"\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.directa-plus.com/\nor contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nCenkos Securities plc\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 131 220 6939\nNeil McDonald\nAdam Rae\nSinger Capital Markets Securities Limited\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma PR\n(Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\ndirectaplus@almapr.co.uk\nHannah Campbell\nKinvara Verdon\nNotes to Editors\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

I am surprised it\u2019s taken so long for PSS to increase his holding. DCTA has a basket of tech and patents that will fit with Nant and Nant can accelerate the growth here significantly. Setcar could be sold off to soften the blow and Nant keep the Grafysorber patents/royalties. Anyways that\u2019s all conjecture for now. If PSS crosses 30% then he has to announce his intentions either to bid or not bid. He doesn\u2019t have to bid. But that would rule out a bid for 6 months (page 8) Rather than me hash it all up it\u2019s probably best if one reads page 13 and 14 for the 30% rule. Mardler, post below,  is correct re price. https://www.burges-salmon.com/-/media/files/publications/open-access/guide-to-public-takeovers-in-the-uk.pdf I used to hold a lot of these and did well from 50p ish and took part in one of the rights issues. Guilio always tried to do the right thing by investors. I sold out when Italy got hit with covid. It took ages to offload. My last foray was just a few shares that I had to sell to get a pot in HEX. Even then I had to split the stock up here to sell and there were several days I couldn\u2019t offload any. Today one can sell ok. Having cut my cloth on smallcaps and got away with it! I bought divi stocks and I am reluctant to sell any as I have low averages and achieved my main objectives. However, ever now and then I spot an opportunity so will have a go. I have always had a soft spot for DCTA I really like the company and its ethos. I knew it was the real deal better than VRS and that has proved the case. The price now is absolute madness but that\u2019s the market. I wouldn\u2019t blame PSS for picking this up at the all time lows for what will be pocket money to him.

Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

          "content": "A takeover here has always been on investors minds. I remember when PSS first started buying. DCTA seemed an obvious fit for Nant. I am surprised it\u2019s taken so long for PSS to increase his holding. DCTA has a basket of tech and patents that will fit with Nant and Nant can accelerate the growth here significantly. Setcar could be sold off to soften the blow and Nant keep the Grafysorber patents/royalties. Anyways that\u2019s all conjecture for now. If PSS crosses 30% then he has to announce his intentions either to bid or not bid. He doesn\u2019t have to bid. But that would rule out a bid for 6 months (page 8) Rather than me hash it all up it\u2019s probably best if one reads page 13 and 14 for the 30% rule. Mardler, post below,  is correct re price. https://www.burges-salmon.com/-/media/files/publications/open-access/guide-to-public-takeovers-in-the-uk.pdf I used to hold a lot of these and did well from 50p ish and took part in one of the rights issues. Guilio always tried to do the right thing by investors. I sold out when Italy got hit with covid. It took ages to offload. My last foray was just a few shares that I had to sell to get a pot in HEX. Even then I had to split the stock up here to sell and there were several days I couldn\u2019t offload any. Today one can sell ok. Having cut my cloth on smallcaps and got away with it! I bought divi stocks and I am reluctant to sell any as I have low averages and achieved my main objectives. However, ever now and then I spot an opportunity so will have a go. I have always had a soft spot for DCTA I really like the company and its ethos. I knew it was the real deal better than VRS and that has proved the case. The price now is absolute madness but that\u2019s the market. I wouldn\u2019t blame PSS for picking this up at the all time lows for what will be pocket money to him. Good luck to holders especially those in higher. Hope you get some cash back one way or another! Usual caveats Trek",

The graphene product maker with operations in Lomazzo, Italy expects to report revenue of EUR7.0 million for 2025, up from EUR6.7 million a year ago. It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

They've been waiting since at least their June finals  last year , should imagine the environmental disasters associated with was will give them plenty to tender for. Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

Unlike Versarien which is a 1 trick pony , Directa Plus has multiple bows. There is the pure graphene play but also the water and soil decontamination angle with their Graysorber, that angle have contracts that will ensure that the lights are still on when graphene adoption curve ramps up.  I expect this to start this year and next year, ( personal opinion and not an investment advice). I was hoping to keep adding while the price was still low but I have used up my ISA allowance for this tax year, so was hoping that nothing will happen till 6th April 2026.",

Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

They've been waiting since at least their June finals  last year , should imagine the environmental disasters associated with was will give them plenty to tender for. Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

AIM - LOSERS Directa Plus PLC, down 19% at 10.89p, 12-month range 21.00p-5.50p. The graphene product maker with operations in Lomazzo, Italy expects to report revenue of EUR7.0 million for 2025, up from EUR6.7 million a year ago. It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

They've been waiting since at least their June finals  last year , should imagine the environmental disasters associated with was will give them plenty to tender for. Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

The graphene product maker with operations in Lomazzo, Italy expects to report revenue of EUR7.0 million for 2025, up from EUR6.7 million a year ago. It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

They've been waiting since at least their June finals  last year , should imagine the environmental disasters associated with was will give them plenty to tender for. Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",

Unlike Versarien which is a 1 trick pony , Directa Plus has multiple bows. There is the pure graphene play but also the water and soil decontamination angle with their Graysorber, that angle have contracts that will ensure that the lights are still on when graphene adoption curve ramps up.  I expect this to start this year and next year, ( personal opinion and not an investment advice). I was hoping to keep adding while the price was still low but I have used up my ISA allowance for this tax year, so was hoping that nothing will happen till 6th April 2026.",

They've been waiting since at least their June finals  last year , should imagine the environmental disasters associated with was will give them plenty to tender for. Know its insensitive but hope they make the most of the situation. \"Post-period end, the Group acquired a further 49% stake in Setcar, taking our shareholding to 99.95%. This acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Directa Plus to take further control of the environmental supply chain and capture maximum value from the commercial offering made possible by our Grafysorber technology.  Setcar is located in Braila, a location with high potential as it is just 10 km from the Ukraine border, on the Danube River. Braila has a river port and is a free zone. We believe Braila has potential to be a gateway to the forthcoming reconstruction of Ukraine and that the acquisition will also accelerate our ability to capture a larger share of the significant global environmental market from a highly strategic area. The Group also launched a pilot for a new concept for produced water treatment using Grafysorber\u00ae, through Setcar, and is in line with the Group's strategy to adopt new technologies that can decontaminate and limit the waste of precious elements such as water. Through integration with Setcar, Grafysorber has been developed over the past few years to generate new products and processes to enable the provision of environmental services. This has enabled us to secure larger contracts as evidenced in FY23 and now with multiple market opportunities, we are confident in further international expansion for this division.",

AIM - LOSERS Directa Plus PLC, down 19% at 10.89p, 12-month range 21.00p-5.50p. The graphene product maker with operations in Lomazzo, Italy expects to report revenue of EUR7.0 million for 2025, up from EUR6.7 million a year ago. It expects an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR2.5 million, narrowed from EUR3.6 million a year prior. \"Entering [financial 2026], Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products,\" the firm says. Non-Executive Chair Richard Hickinbotham will step down at the end of January at the end of his nine-year tenure. CEO Giulio Cesareo will take on the chair role on an interim basis. Directa Plus says the CEO succession process is being progressed. \"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in Ebitda performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the group,\" says CEO Cesareo. \"With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\"",
