UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA THE REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE 'RIS', THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nTissue Regenix Group plc\n('Tissue Regenix', the 'Group' or the 'Company')\nProposed Secured Convertible Loan Note to raise up to \u00a317.5 million\nProposed Cancellation of Admission of Ordinary Shares to Trading on AIM\nRe-registration of the Company as a Private Limited Company\nAdoption of New Articles of Association\nApproval of a waiver under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers\nand\nNotice of General Meeting\nFurther to the recent announcements concerning the Company's financial position, Tissue Regenix (AIM: TRX) today announces that it has conditionally raised \u00a317.5 million, before expenses, by way of the issue of Secured Convertible Loan Notes to Harwood Private Equity VI L.P (and associates) (\"Harwood\"), a substantial Shareholder of the Company (\"Fundraising\").\nOf the Secured Convertible Loan Notes (the \"Secured Convertible Loan Notes\" or \"Notes\"), \u00a37.5 million will be issued immediately on the passing of the necessary Resolutions at a general meeting to be held by the Company, and a further \u00a310.0 million will then be available to the Company for drawdown. In addition, as announced the Company on 1 December 2025, MidCap, the Company's existing lender, has advanced a facility of $500,000 to the Company, to meet its short term cash requirements.\nHarwood has confirmed it intends to convert \u00a3800,000 of the initial \u00a37.5 million at the exercise price of 0.1 pence per Note (the \"Exercise Price\"), immediately following the subscription of the Notes. This will result in the issue to Harwood of 800,000,000 New Ordinary Shares, representing 91.8 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company following such conversion.\nIn addition, the Directors have undertaken an extensive review to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages to the Company and its Shareholders in retaining admission of its ordinary shares to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). The Board has concluded that following completion of the Fundraising, continued admission to trading of the Company's Ordinary Shares on AIM is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The material financial costs, significant management time and the legal and regulatory obligations associated with maintaining the Admission are disproportionate to the benefits to the Company, given that the continued Admission is unlikely to provide the Company with significantly wider or more cost-effective access to capital.\nTherefore, alongside the necessary Rule 9 Waiver Resolution which the Fundraising is conditional upon, the Company is also seeking Shareholder approval for the cancellation of Admission (\"Cancellation\"), subject to the Cancellation becoming effective in accordance with the AIM Rules, for the Re-registration Resolution and adoption of the New Articles. A circular and notice of general meeting will today be posted to Shareholders, including further details of the Resolutions (the \"Circular\"). The general meeting, to seek shareholder approval of the Resolutions, will be held at Platform, New Station St, Leeds LS1 4JB at 3:30 p.m. (UK time) on 22 December 2025 (\"General Meeting\"). As further detailed in the Circular, the Company intends to provide a secondary market trading facility through Asset Match for a minimum period of one year following Cancellation, to enable Shareholders to trade in the shares on a periodic basis.\nFurther information on the terms of the proposed Fundraising and Cancellation, including the conversion terms of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes, and the proposed secondary market trading facility to be put in place by the Company with Asset Match, is included within this announcement below and within the Circular sent to shareholders today.\nFor more information, please contact:\nTissue Regenix Group plc\nJay LeCoque, Executive Chairman\nvia Walbrook PR\nCavendish Capital Markets\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash/Edward Whiley/Hamza Munshi\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nHarriet Ward - ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7466 5000\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR and IR)\nAlice Woodings / Paul McManus\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nTissueRegenix@walbrookpr.com\nMob: +44 (0)7407 804 654 / +44 (0)7980 541 893\nAbout\u00a0Tissue Regenix (\nwww.tissueregenix.com\n)\nTissue Regenix\u00a0is a leading medical device company in regenerative medicine.

Of this, \u00a37.5 million will be issued immediately on the passing of the Resolutions and a further \u00a310 million will be available to the Company for drawdown, subject to Harwood approval, for future growth. In addition, MidCap has provided a facility of $500,000 available to support the future growth of the Company, further detail of which is set out in paragraph 2 of Part I of the Circular.\nThe purpose of the Circular is to explain the background to the Fundraising, to set out the reasons why the Board believes that the Fundraising is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders and to seek Shareholder approval of the Resolutions at the forthcoming General Meeting, which will be held at Platform, New Station St, Leeds LS1 4JB at 3.30 p.m (UK time) on 22 December 2025.\nIn addition, following a detailed review, the Directors have concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders to seek a Cancellation of admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM as the costs in retaining the Company's quotation on AIM outweigh the potential benefits. The Company is consequently also seeking Shareholders' approval of the Cancellation Resolution and, subject to the Cancellation becoming effective in accordance with the AIM Rules, of the Re-registration Resolution and adoption of the New Articles. Pursuant to Rule 41 of the AIM Rules, Cavendish has notified AIM of the intention to cancel admission to trading on AIM.\nThe Cancellation Resolution is conditional, pursuant to Rule 41 of the AIM Rules, upon the approval of Shareholders holding not less than 75 per cent. of the votes cast by Shareholders (whether present in person or by proxy) at the General Meeting and accordingly the Cancellation Resolution will be proposed as a Special Resolution (as defined in the Articles). If the Cancellation Resolution is passed at the General Meeting, it is anticipated that the Cancellation will become effective at 7:00 a.m. on 7 January 2026. The Notice of the General Meeting is set out in\nPart III\nof the Circular.\nGiven the urgency of the funding requirement, the circular is being posted at the earliest opportunity.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nThe Company has called the General Meeting in order to put to Shareholders the Resolutions required to approve the Rule 9 Waiver and complete the Fundraising, Cancellation, Re-registration and adoption of the New Articles.\nFollowing such Cancellation, Shareholders would then hold their Ordinary Shares in an unquoted company for which there may be much less liquidity than were they traded on AIM. Shareholders should read and understand paragraph 2 of Part I of the Circular.\nConversion of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes is entirely at Harwood's discretion and can occur at any stage following the entering into of the Secured Convertible Loan Note Instrument and issue of the Notes by the Company.\nAs detailed above, \u00a37.5 million of the Notes will be issued immediately and Harwood has confirmed it intends to convert \u00a3800,000 of the initial \u00a37.5 million at the Exercise Price, immediately following the subscription for the Secured Convertible Loan Notes. This will result in the issue to Harwood of 800,000,000 New Ordinary Shares, representing 91.8 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company following such conversion.\nIF THE RESOLUTIONS ARE NOT APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS AT THE GENERAL MEETING, THE FUNDRAISING WILL NOT PROCEED. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ANTICIPATED NET PROCEEDS OF THE FUNDRAISING WOULD NOT BECOME AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY. THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT OTHER FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON SUITABLE\nTERMS\nOR\nAT\nALL.\nACCORDINGLY,\nIN LIGHT OF THE GROUP'S REDUCING CASH POSITION, IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE DIRECTORS WOULD NEED TO APPOINT ADMINISTRATORS.\nIf you are in any doubt as to what action you should take in respect of the Circular, you should immediately seek your own personal \ufb01nancial advice from your stockbroker, bank manager,\nsolicitor, accountant or other independent professional adviser duly authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) if you are resident in the United Kingdom or, if not, from another appropriately authorised independent \ufb01nancial adviser.\n2.\nBACKGROUND TO, REASONS FOR AND DETAILS OF THE FUNDRAISING\n,\nCANCELLATION, DELISTING AND RE-REGISTRATION AS A PRIVATE LIMITED COMPANY\nBusiness overview of the Company\nFounded in the UK, the Company is a medical device company in regenerative medicine.\nThe Company's patented decellularisation technology (dCELL\u00ae) removes DNA and other cellular material from animal and human soft tissue, leaving tissue scaffolding not rejected by the patient's body that can be used to repair diseased or damaged body structures. Applications for this technology address many crucial clinical needs in sports medicine, foot and ankle injuries and wound care. The Company is a fundamentally sound business with an established and diversified portfolio of best-in-class bone and derma tissue medical device consumables and a broad customer base consisting primarily of hospitals and surgical organisations located in the US.\nThe global regenerative biomaterials market focused on bone and soft-tissue grafting is an expanding, clinically critical field driven by rising orthopaedic, spine, trauma, dental, and chronic wound care needs. Advances in surgical techniques, aging populations, higher rates of musculoskeletal and metabolic disease, and increasing demand for biologic solutions are accelerating adoption across hospital and ambulatory settings worldwide. Bone grafts and substitutes represent a multi-billion-dollar category primarily in spine fusion, trauma repair, and dental reconstruction, while soft-tissue allografts and biologic matrices are gaining momentum in sports medicine, complex reconstruction, and advanced wound management. With growing clinical evidence and adoption the segment is positioned for sustained, mid-single-digit growth and expanding global penetration.\nThe global bone graft and related substitutes market is estimated at $3-4 billion USD with mid-single digit CAGR projected through 2030. North America represents 45-50% of the market with solid reimbursement and high procedure volumes relative to other markets. Europe and APAC account for 18-25% of the market with APAC growing faster than the EU as a result of improving access to healthcare.\nThe global soft tissue and repair market is estimated at $4-7 billion USD depending upon market definition again with mid-single digit CAGR through 2030. Like bone grafts North America represents the largest share of the market opportunity at 40-50% followed by Europe and APAC at 20-25% and 15-25% respectively.\nReasons for the Fundraising\nThe Company announced on 16 October 2025 that its previously published financial results were not accurate. Upon review of the financial inaccuracies in relation to the year-end inventory and cost of sales for FY24, there would be a restatement of FY24 adjusted EBITDA from $1.9 million profit to an EBITDA loss of $1 million. The Company had reported a small profit of $0.2 million in the first half of 2025 and this would also be restated to an EBITDA loss of $2.3 million. In coming to this conclusion, the Board have made certain assumptions on the continued performance of order intake from repeat customers, new customer wins, retaining its ability to convert the Company's new business pipeline, and on maintaining the Company's current level of operations through existing resources such that expected sales in the period are completed in a timely manner. It is further assumed the Company experiences no material unforeseen events which cause disruption to regular operations. The Directors confirm that this outlook remains valid, that it has been properly compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated and that the basis of accounting used is consistent with the Company's accounting policies. The Company also announced that there would be a new senior management team, consisting of a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company announced that the cash position as at 30 June 2025 was $1.1 million, with debt facilities of $16 million of which $10.4 million was drawn down.\nOn 22 October 2025, the Company announced that it had requested the temporary suspension of trading on AIM of the Company's Ordinary Shares and trading was accordingly suspended.\nThis significant downturn in profitability and cash flow that the Company has experienced has been driven by a combination of operational missteps and financial mismanagement.\nThe former management team made poor decisions, including sourcing lower-quality organ donors in an effort to cut costs. The lower quality donors, typically smaller and older, yielded less usable tissue - roughly half as much as usual. That meant that the Company had to spend considerably more on materials and labour cost doubled to get the same results.\nCompounding this issue, the reduced tissue yields were not properly captured or reflected in the Company's accounting records, therefore materially understating the Company's cost of sales. The discrepancy was only recently uncovered through an internal investigation conducted by the new senior management.\nThe Company has also prioritised top-line growth regardless of profitability. Some distributors received commissions as high as 50%, generating negative gross margins. At the same time, product pricing remained below market, despite the Company's best-in-class products.\nThis constant mismanagement and failure to true-up materials purchase price variances to standard costs, resulted in $2 million of inventory overstatement, meaning the Company looked more profitable than it was. In addition, another $385,000 worth of goods were received and not recorded in FY24 and the Company received $1 million worth of organs from a vendor which had been incorrectly posted to cost of goods sold instead of goods received not invoiced. These errors add up to $3.4 million in losses, reducing the Company's reported $1.9 million 2024 EBITDA profit to a $1.5 million EBITDA loss.\nThe Company was losing money and relied increasingly on its $7 million revolving credit facility to fund operations, which is now fully drawn. Approximately $4 million of the Company's $5.9 million in accounts payable to suppliers are 60 or more days overdue. Many vendors remain unpaid, eroding confidence amongst critical suppliers, including donor tissue providers and testing laboratories. As a result, several have halted shipments and test results releases pending payment.\nThe Company has therefore taken the decision to carry out the Fundraising to provide a cash injection into the Company to prevent further deterioration and allow time for the new senior management's recovery plan to take effect.\nWithout this cash injection, the Company will not be able to continue to trade and will need to appoint administrators.\nThe Fundraising and Terms of the Secured Convertible Loan Note\nThe Company has conditionally raised up to \u00a317.5 million, before expenses, by way of the issue of Secured Convertible Loan Notes to Harwood. Discussions with Harwood commenced following the announcement made by the Company on 16 October 2025, regarding the accuracy of the Company's financial results.\nThe Fundraising is conditional on the passing of the Resolutions and the satisfaction of all conditions precedent. In order to meet the short-term cash requirements of the Company prior to the General Meeting and the satisfaction of all conditions precedent, MidCap has provided an Advance Loan of $500,000. Following Shareholder approval of the Resolutions and the satisfaction of all conditions precedent, the Secured Convertible Loan Notes will be issued and \u00a37.5 million will be available for immediate draw down. The proceeds will be used (i) to repay the Advance Loan in full, (ii) to reduce other outstanding MidCap loans from $7 million to $3.5 million, and (iii) to strengthen the Company's working capital position. The outstanding balance of the Secured Convertible Loan Note of \u00a310 million will be available to be drawn down at the request of the Company, subject to Harwood's approval.\nDetails of the terms of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes are set out below.\nSecured Convertible Loan Notes\nThe key terms of the Secured Convertible Loan Note Instrument are as follows:\n1.\nAll outstanding Notes will be repayable on 31 December 2032 subject to earlier repayment on a change of control of the Company or on the occurrence of market standard events of default.\n2.\nInterest will be payable on the Notes at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, interest to be payable in kind. The interest will be added to the principal Notes and convert with the principal.\n3.\nThe Notes will be convertible at any time by written notice to the Company at a price of \u00a30.001 nominal of Notes for one new Ordinary Share, being the nominal value of an Existing Ordinary Share.\n4.\nThe Notes will be secured by security over the US and UK group companies, such security being fully subordinated to the existing security in favour of MidCap.\n5.\nOryx will contribute a total of \u00a31.5 million toward the Secured Convertible Loan Notes. Of this commitment, \u00a31 million will be invested upfront as part of the initial \u00a37.5 million drawdown available following shareholder approval of the Resolutions. The remaining \u00a30.5 million from Oryx will be included within the subsequent \u00a310 million that may be drawn down by the Company, subject to Harwood's approval. The balance of the funds required for the Secured Convertible Loan Notes will be provided by HPE6.\n\u00a37.5 million of the Notes will be issued immediately and Harwood has confirmed it intends to convert \u00a3800,000 of the initial \u00a37.5 million at the Exercise Price, immediately following the subscription for the Secured Convertible Loan Notes. This will result in the issue to Harwood of 800,000,000 New Ordinary Shares, representing 91.8 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company following such conversion.\nFurther details of the terms of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes are set out in paragraph\n8.1\nof\nPart II\nof the Circular.\nReasons for the Cancellation\nGiven the recent challenges that the Company has faced and the consequential decline in the share price, the Board does not believe that the Company's future is best served by the continued admission of its Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM. After careful consideration, the Board has concluded that the Cancellation, following completion of the Fundraising, is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Directors have undertaken a review to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages to the Company and its Shareholders in retaining its Admission. The material financial costs, significant management time and the legal and regulatory obligations associated with maintaining the Admission are disproportionate to the benefits to the Company, given that the continued Admission is unlikely to provide the Company with significantly wider or more cost-effective access to capital.\nProcess for, and principal effects of, the Cancellation\nUnder the AIM Rules, it is a requirement that the Cancellation must be approved by Shareholders holding not less than 75 per cent. of votes cast by Shareholders (whether present in person or by proxy) at the General Meeting. Accordingly, the General Meeting set out in Part III of the Circular contains,\ninter alia\n, a special resolution to approve the Cancellation.\nFurthermore, Rule 41 of the AIM Rules requires any AIM company that wishes the London Stock Exchange to cancel the admission of its shares to trading on AIM to notify Shareholders and to separately inform the London Stock Exchange of its preferred cancellation date at least 20 clear Business Days prior to such date. In accordance with AIM Rule 41, the Directors have notified the London Stock Exchange of the Company's intention, subject to the Cancellation Resolution being passed at the General Meeting, to cancel the Admission on 7 January 2026.\nIt is noted that the Ordinary Shares are currently suspended from trading on AIM. If the Cancellation Resolution is passed at the General Meeting, it is proposed that the Cancellation will take effect at 7:00 a.m. on 7 January 2026. If the Cancellation becomes effective, Cavendish will cease to be nominated adviser of the Company, and the Company will no longer be required to comply with the AIM Rules. The principal effects of the Cancellation are detailed further below:\n(a)\nthere would no longer be a formal market mechanism enabling Shareholders to trade their shares through AIM and the Ordinary Shares may be more difficult to sell compared to shares of companies traded on AIM (or any other recognised market or trading exchange);\n(b)\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime applicable to companies whose shares are admitted to trading on AIM will no longer apply;\n(c)\nShareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules for Companies, such as the requirement to be notified of certain material developments or events (including substantial transactions, financing transactions, related party transactions and certain acquisitions and disposals) and the separate requirement to seek shareholder approval for certain other corporate events such as reverse takeovers or fundamental changes in the Company's business;\n(d)\nCavendish would cease to be the Company's nominated adviser and broker;\n(e)\nthe levels of disclosure and corporate governance within the Company may not be as stringent as for a company quoted on AIM;\n(f)\nthe Company will no longer be required to publicly disclose any change in major shareholdings in the Company under the AIM Rules for Companies;\n(g)\nthe Company will no longer be subject to the UK Market Abuse Regulation regulating inside information and other matters;\n(h)\nwhilst the Company's CREST facility will remain in place immediately post the Cancellation, the Company's CREST facility may be cancelled in the future and, although the Ordinary Shares will remain transferable, they may cease to be transferable through CREST (in which case, Shareholders who hold Ordinary Shares in CREST will receive share certificates);\n(i)\nthere will be no formal market and quote and, consequently, it may be more difficult for Shareholders to determine the market value of their investment in the Company at any given time;\n(j)\nthe Ordinary Shares will cease to be eligible to be held in an individual savings account (\"ISA\") following the Cancellation becoming effective in accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies; and\n(k)\nthe Cancellation may have taxation or other commercial consequences for Shareholders.\nShareholders are advised to consult their own professional independent tax adviser in relation to their own tax position.\nThe above\nconsiderations\nare not exhaustive, and Shareholders should seek their own independent advice when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nAs further detailed in the Secondary market trading facility section below, the Company intends to provide a secondary market trading facility through Asset Match for a minimum period of 1 year following Cancellation, to enable Shareholders to trade in the shares on a periodic basis.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Company will remain on Companies House in accordance with and, subject to the Act, notwithstanding the Cancellation.\nShareholders should also note that the Takeover Code will continue to apply to the Company following the Cancellation and Shareholders will remain entitled to the protections afforded to them by the Takeover Code until the second anniversary of the Cancellation.\nDe-listing and Re-registration\nUnder the UK Listing Rules, delisting can only be effected by the Company after passing a special resolution of its Shareholders in general meeting and the expiry of a period of 20 clear Business Days from the date on which notice of the delisting is given to the London Stock Exchange.\nFollowing the Cancellation and delisting, the Board believes there will be no need for the Company to remain a public limited company and it is therefore proposed that, subject to the Cancellation becoming effective, the Company will re-register as a private limited company.\nSubject to the Cancellation becoming effective\nin accordance with the AIM Rules, the Company will change its name to \"Tissue Regenix Group Ltd\".\nRe-registration will take effect when the Registrar of Companies issues a certificate of incorporation on Re-registration. The Registrar of Companies will not issue the certificate of incorporation on Re-registration until the Registrar of Companies is satisfied that no valid application can be made to cancel the resolution to re-register as a private limited company.\nIf the Cancellation Resolution and Re-registration Resolution are passed at the General Meeting and the Registrar of Companies issues a certificate of incorporation on Re-registration, it is anticipated that the Re-registration will become effective by 7 January 2026.\nThe Company will continue to be bound by the Act following the Cancellation and Re-registration.\nAdoption of New Articles\nF\nollowing the Cancellation, it is proposed that the New Articles, which are more applicable to a company whose shares are not publicly listed, be adopted. The Cancellation Resolution and Re-registration Resolution approve the adoption of the New Articles in substitution for, and to the exclusion of, the Company's existing Articles which were last updated on 27 April 2023.\nThe principal changes in the New Articles are summarised below and reflect the change in the Company's status to a private limited company:\n(a)\nFinancial statements\n: The Company is currently required to publish annual and half yearly financial statements. Following the adoption of the New Articles, the Company will no longer be required to publish accounting records, save for the publishing of annual accounts as required the Act on Companies House. Furthermore, the Company will not be required to circulate copies of financial statements to its Shareholders and Shareholders will only be able to inspect financial statements of the Company in certain limited circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n(b)\nRequirement to appoint auditors\n: Following the adoption of the New Articles the Company will no longer be required to appoint an auditor to audit its financial statements.\n(c)\nGeneral meetings and written resolutions\n: The Company is currently required to hold an annual general meeting of Shareholders each year. Following the adoption of the New Articles the Company will no longer hold annual general meetings. In addition, following the adoption of the New Articles, resolutions of the Shareholders of the Company may be obtained via written resolutions rather than at general meetings. This is done by the approval in writing of the requisite majority of voting shares then in issue (50% or 75%, as applicable).\n(d)\nRetirement:\nThe current Articles also provide that one third of the directors shall retire from office by rotation at each general meeting. Provisions concerning retirement by rotation of directors are not included in the New Articles.\n(e)\nIssues of Shares:\nThe Directors are currently subject to certain restrictions in the context of share issuances. Following the adoption of the New Articles, the Directors will be able to issue shares in the Company at such time, to such persons, for such consideration and on such terms as they may determine without restriction.\nA copy of the New Articles will be available for inspection at the Company's website.\nRisks related to the Cancellation and Re-registration\nVoting\nUpon the Cancellation and Re-registration becoming effective, it will be binding on all Shareholders irrespective of whether or not they voted in favour of, or against, or abstained from voting on the Cancellation and Re-registration Resolutions at the General Meeting.\nRegulation\nThe regulatory and financial reporting regimes applicable to companies whose shares are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities will no longer apply. In addition, the Company will no longer be subject to the UK Market Abuse Regulation or the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and will therefore no longer be required to, inter alia, disclose significant shareholdings in the Company.\nThe Company will no longer be subject to the UK Listing Rules and accordingly, Shareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the UK Listing Rules and the Company will cease to have a broker.\nInformation\nCertain standards and protections and disclosure of information requirements afforded to shareholders in a company admitted to trading on AIM are substantially different to a shareholding in an unlisted private company.\nThe levels of transparency and corporate governance within the Company may not be as stringent as for a\nCompany listed on AIM.\nFuture liquidity and valuation\nFollowing Cancellation and Re-registration, there will not be the same formal market mechanism enabling the Shareholders to trade their Shares on the London Stock Exchange. While the Ordinary Shares will remain freely transferable, it is possible that the liquidity and marketability of the Ordinary Shares will, in the future, be more constrained than at present and the value of such shares may be adversely affected as a consequence.\nAdditionally, in the absence of a formal market and quotation, it may be more difficult for Shareholders to determine the market value of their Ordinary Shares at any given time.\nArticles of association\nThe Company intends to adopt the New Articles to reflect the change in the Company's status to a private limited company and may also consider making further amendments to the New Articles in due course. Any future articles of association adopted by the Company may not offer the same level of protection for minority shareholders as the Articles or the New Articles.\nPersonal considerations\nThe Cancellation and Re-registration may have personal consequences for Shareholders in respect of taxation or otherwise. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their individual tax position or any other consequences relating to the Cancellation and Re-registration should consult their own professional independent tax adviser without delay.\nThe above considerations are not exhaustive and Shareholders should seek their own independent advice when assessing the likely individual impact of the proposal on them.\nTransactions in the Ordinary Shares following the proposed Cancellation\nThe Board is aware that the proposed Cancellation, should it be approved by Shareholders at the General Meeting, would make it more difficult to buy and sell Ordinary Shares in the Company following the Cancellation. Therefore, the Company has arranged a secondary market trading facility to assist Shareholders to trade in the Ordinary Shares, and this will be put in place from the day of Cancellation.\nSecondary market trading facility\nThe secondary market trading facility will be provided by Asset Match and will be reviewed on an annual basis. The Board intends to make this available for a minimum period of at least one year. This facility will allow existing shareholders of the Company, and new investors, to trade Ordinary Shares by matching buyers and sellers through periodic auctions. Asset Match operates an open auction system where volumes of bids and offers at different prices are displayed on its website together with the closing date of the auction. At the end of each auction period Asset Match passes this information through a non-discretionary algorithm that determines a \"fair\" share price based on supply and demand and allocates transactions accordingly. Bids and offers may be made and withdrawn at any time before the closing date of each auction.\nShareholders will continue to be able to hold their shares in uncertificated form (i.e. in CREST) and should check with their existing stockbroker whether they are willing or able to trade in unquoted shares. Shareholders wishing to trade shares through Asset Match must do so through a stockbroker and a comprehensive list of stockbrokers who have signed up to access the Asset Match platform is available on request.\nShould the Cancellation become effective and the Company put in place the secondary market trading facility, details will be made available to Shareholders on the Company's website at\nwww.tissueregenix.com\nand directly by letter or e-mail (where appropriate).\nFurther information about the secondary market trading facility, including indicative prices and a history of transactions, will be available on the Asset Match website which is located at\nwww.assetmatch.com\n.\nShould Cancellation proceed, Shareholders may contact Asset Match in relation to any queries regarding trading via the secondary market trading facility by emailing\ndealing@assetmatch.com\n.\n3.\nCURRENT TRADING/SUSPENSION\nSuspension\nOn 22 October 2025, the Company announced the immediate suspension of trading in its Ordinary Shares on AIM. This action was due to the high levels of financial volatility and was taken to enable the newly appointed senior leadership team to complete a detailed review of the previously disclosed restatement of revenue for the FY24, assess the implications for H125 adjusted EBITDA, and evaluate the Company's cash position and ongoing performance. Until this review is concluded, the Company will not be in a position to provide clarity on its financial position. In the interim, enhanced financial controls have been implemented and a comprehensive cost review is underway, targeting reductions in excess of $2 million. The Board remains committed to restoring the Company's financial stability and ensuring compliance with all applicable obligations.\nCurrent Trading\nOn 7 November 2025, the Company issued an update on its financial position following the temporary suspension of trading in its Ordinary Shares announced on 22 October 2025. It has become clear to the senior leadership team that the Company faces a significant backlog of creditors and holds very limited cash reserves. As a result, the Company has an urgent requirement to secure additional funding and requires the proceeds of the Fundraising to provide the working capital needed.\nWithout\nthe Fundraising, the Company would not be able to remain solvent and accordingly will need to appoint administrators.\n4.\nINTENTIONS OF HARWOOD FOR THE COMPANY\n4.1\nHarwood has con\ufb01rmed there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding for the transfer of its Ordinary Shares to any third party.\n4.2\nHarwood has no intention of making any change in relation to:\n4.2.1 the continued employment of the employees and management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including any material change in the conditions of employment or in the balance of the skills and functions of the employees and management;\n4.2.2 the Company's future business including its research and development functions;\n4.2.3 the location of the Company's headquarters or headquarter functions or the location of the Company's places of business;\n4.2.4 the redeployment of the Company's \ufb01xed assets; or\n4.2.5 employer contributions into the Company's pension schemes, the accrual bene\ufb01ts of existing members and the admission of new members.\n4.3\nIn considering whether to recommend that Independent Shareholders vote in favour of the Rule 9 Waiver, the Independent Directors have also given due consideration to the intentions of Harwood with respect to the future operation of the business and welcome the assurances made by Harwood that it does not seek to make any changes to the Company's future business, \ufb01xed assets, headquarter functions, research and development functions, employees or management or pension schemes.\n5.\nCOMPANY'S INTENTIONS\n5.1\nThe Company intends to continue providing certain facilities and services to Shareholders that are presently available to them as shareholders of an AIM-listed company following the proposed Cancellation. It is intended that the Company will continue to:\n5.1.1 communicate information about the Company (including annual accounts) to its Shareholders, as required by law; and\n5.1.2 maintain its website and to periodically post updates on the website. However, Shareholders should note that the Company will not be obligated to include all information required under AIM Rule 26 or to update the website as mandated by the AIM Rules. As a result, the level of detail and frequency of updates may differ from what is currently provided as an AIM-listed company.\n6.\nUSE OF PROCEEDS OF THE FUNDRAISING\nThe gross proceeds of the Fundraising are \u00a317.5 million of which approximately \u00a37.5 million will be advanced immediately and used to meet the Company's immediate working capital requirements to remain solvent and repay the Advance Loan. The remaining \u00a310 million will be advanced at Harwood's discretion and following a request from the Company.\n7.\nAPPLICATION OF THE TAKEOVER CODE AND RULE 9 WAIVER\nTakeover Code\nThe Takeover Code is issued and administered by the Takeover Panel. The Takeover Code applies to all takeover and merger transactions, however effected, where the offeree company is, among other things, a listed or unlisted public company resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man (and to certain categories of private limited companies). The Company is a public company whose Ordinary Shares are admitted to trading on AIM, and its Shareholders are therefore entitled to the protections afforded by the Takeover Code.\nUnder Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, any person who acquires an interest in shares (as de\ufb01ned in the Takeover Code) which, taken together with any shares in which that person or any other person acting in concert with that person is interested, carry 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights of a company which is subject to the Takeover Code, is normally required to make an offer to all of the remaining shareholders to acquire their shares in the company.\nSimilarly, when any person, together with persons acting in concert with him, is interested in shares which in aggregate carry not less than 30 per cent. of the voting rights of such a company, but does not hold shares carrying more than 50 per cent. of such voting rights, a general offer will normally be required if any further interest in shares is acquired by any such person, or persons acting in concert with him, which increases the percentage of shares carrying voting rights held by such persons.\nAn offer under Rule 9 would have to be made in cash at a price not less than the highest price paid for any interest in shares in the Company by that person or by any person acting in concert with it within the 12 months prior to the announcement of the offer.\nRule 9 Waiver Resolution\nHarwood is currently bene\ufb01cially interested in 15,730,000 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 22.03% of the Existing Ordinary Shares.\nThe interests of Harwood in relevant securities of the Company, as at the Reference Date, following conversion of the Post First Tranche Notes and assuming full conversion of the Notes, are set out below:\nHarwood Member\nExisting Ordinary Shares\nPercentage\nof Existing Ordinary Shares\nOrdinary Shares following conversion of Post First Tranche\nNotes\nPercentage following Post First Tranche Notes\nMaximum New\nOrdinary Shares\nPercentage of\nMaximum Enlarged Share Capital\nHarwood Capital LLP (London)\n630,000\n0.88%\n630,000\n0.07%\n630,000\n0.004%\nOryx International Growth Fund Ltd\n15,100,000\n21.15%\n124,190,909\n14.25%\n1,515,100,000\n8.62%\nHarwood Private Equity VI L.P.\n0\n0%\n690,909,091\n79.29%\n16,000,000,000\n90.97%\nTotals\n15,730,000\n22.03%\n815,730,000\n93.61%\n17,515,730,000\n99.59%*\n\\* The percentages for Oryx International Growth Fund Limited and Harwood Private Equity VI L.P. assume full conversion of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes excluding any payment in kind.\nThe Takeover Panel has agreed, subject to the passing of the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution by the\nIndependent\nShareholders\non\na\npoll\nat\nthe\nGeneral\nMeeting,\nto\nwaive\nthe obligation of Harwood that would otherwise arise as a result of the conversion of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes. Accordingly, the Company is proposing the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution at the General Meeting, which will be taken on a poll.\nThe Rule 9 Waiver will be invalidated if any purchases are made by Harwood or any party acting in concert with Harwood in the period between the date of this announcement and the General Meeting.\nShareholders should note that any further increase in the interests of Harwood in the Ordinary Shares of the Company that increases the percentage of the voting rights in the Company in which they are interested, whether collectively or individually, will not be subject to the provisions of Rule 9 following conversion. Following conversion, if Harwood hold over 50 per cent. it may acquire further interests in the Ordinary Shares without incurring any further obligation to make an offer under Rule 9 but will not be restricted from making an offer for the Company.\n8.\nGENERAL MEETING\nThe Notice of General Meeting is set out at the end of the Circular. The General Meeting is to be held at Platform, New Station St, Leeds LS1 4JB at 3:30 p.m (UK time) on 22 December 2025.\nThe Company has called the General Meeting in order to (i) put to Independent Shareholders the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution required to approve the Rule 9 Waiver and to (ii) put to Shareholders the other Resolutions set out in\nPart III\n(\nNotice of General Meeting\n) of the Circular. Your attention is drawn to the fact that all of the Resolutions must be passed by Shareholders at the General Meeting in order for the Fundraising to proceed.\nResolution 1 is the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution which is an ordinary resolution, which will be proposed in accordance with the Takeover Code and will be taken on a poll of Independent Shareholders present in person and by proxy voting at the General Meeting.\nThe Takeover Code requires the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution to be passed by the Independent Shareholders only.\nAt the General Meeting the following additional Resolutions will be proposed:\nResolution 2 - Authority to allot shares\nResolution 2 is an ordinary resolution to authorise the Directors to allot relevant securities with a nominal value of \u00a30.001, being equal to 17,500,000,000 New Ordinary Shares (i.e. the maximum number of Ordinary Shares that may be allotted pursuant to or in connection with the Secured Convertible Loan Note Instrument).\nResolution 3 - Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights\nResolution 3, which is conditional on the passing of Resolution 2, is a special resolution to authorise the Directors to allot 17,500,000,000 New Ordinary Shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis.\nResolution 4 - Cancellation\nResolution 4, the Cancellation Resolution is a special resolution to approve the Cancellation and authorise the Directors to take all action necessary or reasonably required to effect such Cancellation.\nResolution 5 - Re-registration\nResolution 5, the Re-registration Resolution is a special resolution to approve the re-registration and name change of the company to a private limited company and authorise the Directors to take all action necessary or reasonably required to effect such Re-registration.\nResolution 6 - New Articles\nResolution 6, which is conditional on the passing of Resolutions 4 and 5, is a special resolution which approves the adoption of the New Articles with effect from the Cancellation becoming effective in accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies.\nThe authorities given by Resolutions 2 to 6 (inclusive) will be in addition to any existing similar authorities which the Directors may have.\nResolutions 3, 4, 5 and 6 are proposed to be passed as special resolutions requiring the approval of\nShareholders holding a majority of not less than 75 per cent of the voting rights attributable to the Ordinary Shares held by those Shareholders which are present and voting at the General Meeting and are entitled under the Articles to vote.\nResolutions 1 and 2 are propose\nd to be passed as ordinary resolutions (of which Resolution 1 will be taken on a\npoll) approved by Shareholders holding a majority of not less than 50 per cent of the voting rights attributable to the Ordinary Shares held by those Shareholders which are present and voting at the General Meeting and, in the case of Resolution 1 are entitled under the Articles to vote on a poll.\nIf the Resolutions are not approved by Shareholders at the General Meeting, the Fundraising will not proceed. As such, the anticipated net proceeds of the Fundraising would not become available to the Company. There is no certainty that other funding would be available on suitable\nterms\nor\nat\nall.\nAccordingly,\nin light of the Group's reducing cash position, in such circumstances the Directors would need to appoint administrators.\n9.\nACTION TO BE TAKEN BY SHAREHOLDERS\nWhether or not you intend to be present at the General Meeting, you are asked to submit your vote electronically at\nwww.signalshares.com\n.\nElectronic proxy appointments must be received by no later than 3.30 p.m on 18 December 2025 (or, in the case of an adjournment of the General Meeting, not less than 48 hours before the time \ufb01xed for the holding of the adjourned General Meeting (at the discretion of the Directors, excluding any part of a day that is not a working day)).\nAlternatively, Shareholders can request a hard copy Form of Proxy from the Company's Registrar, MUFG Capital Markets.\nIf you hold your Existing Ordinary Shares in uncerti\ufb01cated form (that is, in CREST) you may vote using the CREST proxy voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in the CREST Manual (please also refer to the accompanying notes to the Notice of the General Meeting set out at the end of the Circular). Proxies submitted via CREST must be received by the Company's Registrar, by no later than 3.30 p.m on 18 December 2025 (or, in the case of an adjournment of the General Meeting, not less than 48 hours before the time \ufb01xed for the holding of the adjourned General Meeting (at the discretion of the Directors, excluding any part of a day that is not a working day)).\nIf you are an institutional investor you may also be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform, a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity, please go to\nwww.proxymity.io\n.\nAppointing a proxy in accordance with the instructions set out above will enable your vote to be counted at the General Meeting in the event of your absence. Appointment of a proxy electronically, via the CREST proxy voting service, Proxymity or via completion of a hard copy Form of Proxy will not prevent you from attending and voting at the General Meeting, or any adjournment of it, in person should you be entitled to and wish to do so.\nIf Shareholders require help with voting online, require a hard copy Form of Proxy or if they have any queries in relation to voting, they should contact the Company's Registrar, on Tel: 03716640300\nor\nby email at\nshareholderenquiries@cm.mpms.com\n. Calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. Lines are open between 9.00 a.m. - 5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales).\n10.\nINDEPENDENT ADVICE IN RESPECT OF THE WAIVER\nThe Takeover Code requires the Independent Directors to obtain competent independent advice regarding the merits of the Proposals. Cavendish has provided \ufb01nancial advice to the Directors regarding the Proposals and in providing such advice, Cavendish has taken into account the Directors' commercial assessments. Cavendish con\ufb01rms that it, and any person who is or is presumed to be acting in concert with it, is independent of the Noteholder and has no personal, \ufb01nancial or commercial relationship, or arrangements or understandings with the Noteholder. Cavendish has given and has not withdrawn its written consent to the inclusion in the Circular of its name and the references to it in the form and context in which they are included.\n11.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTION\nThe entering into of the Secured Convertible Loan Notes instruments by Harwood (and associated funds) constitutes a related party transaction within the meaning of the AIM Rules, by virtue of Harwood being a substantial shareholder with 22.03 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital. The Independent Directors, being all Directors excluding Jay LeCoque and George Brian Philips, for the purposes of this opinion consider, having consulted with Cavendish (the Company's nominated adviser), that the terms of the Secured Convertible Loan Note are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's Shareholders are concerned.\nAs per the above, Jay LeCoque is not classified as an Independent Director, as he has been appointed by Harwood and George Brian Phillips is not classified as an Independent Director because he holds shares through a Harwood private client account.\n12.\nRECOMMENDATION AND IRREVOCABLE UNDERTAKINGS\nHarwood is considered to be interested in the outcome of the General Meeting. Accordingly, no Director who is also a member of Harwood has participated in the Independent Directors' recommendation and no member of Harwood will vote on the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution.\nIn addition, given that Oryx is a Shareholder and is considered to be interested in the outcome of the General Meeting, Oryx will not vote on the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution.\nThe Independent Directors, having been so advised by Cavendish, as the Company's independent financial advisor, consider the terms of the Proposals to be fair and reasonable as far as Independent Shareholders are concerned and therefore in the best interests of the Company as a whole. In providing this advice, the Independent Directors and Cavendish have taken into account the Directors' commercial assessments.\nAccordingly, the Independent Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting, as the Independent Directors have undertaken to do in respect of their own bene\ufb01cial holdings, amounting as at the Reference Date in aggregate to 129,839 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 0.18% of the Existing Ordinary Shares. Irrevocables have been received from Lombard Odier and Richard Griffiths to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the General Meeting in respect of their own bene\ufb01cial holdings amounting to in aggregate 15,163,314 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 21.24 per cent. of the Existing Ordinary Shares.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe following de\ufb01nitions apply throughout this announcement unless
