At the time the petition was filed, the Company was not under significant pressure from its creditors and had secured the support of funding partners to continue its operations. Over several months and a number of hearings, the former directors committed significant time, energy, and financial resources to seeking a rescission and a viable outcome for all stakeholders, which includes personally bearing the legal costs associated with seeking the rescission. The Company had identified a number of potential funding partners during this period but, as a result of the position the Company found itself in, it was not able to secure the necessary funding.\nThe Company continues to explore options to preserve value for creditors and shareholders, in so far as possible.\nEnquires should be directed to the Official Receiver which can be contacted on\n0300 678 0015 or\nNottingham.OR@insolvency.gov.uk\n.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as amended by regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310.
