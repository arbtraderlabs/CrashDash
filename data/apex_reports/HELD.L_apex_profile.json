Noting the announcement made on 16 May 2024, any further payments due to RiverFort, pursuant to the amended mezzanine loan agreement, will be deferred until the earlier of 30 September 2024, or receipt of the long term loan announced on 22 April 2024, now expected to be received in July 2024.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplications have been made to the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (\"LSE\") for the admission to the Official List of the FCA and to trading on the Main Market of the LSE respectively, of the 4,363,636 New Ordinary Shares in respect of the settlement. It is expected that the New Ordinary Shares will be admitted to trading and dealings will commence on the LSE on or around 16 July 2024 (\"Admission\"). The New Ordinary Shares will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each, currently traded on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 146,907,454 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each.

Hellenic Dynamics' core strategy is to develop and operate its 40,000 square metre active culti-vation licence from its 195,506 square metre facility located near Thessaloniki in Northern Greece. In full production, Hellenic Dynamics is capable of producing over 54,000 kg of dried flowers per annum.\nHellenic Dynamics will take advantage of its relatively low cost base resulting from a comparatively low cost of power, having its own running water supply and the labour rates for skilled and semi-skilled labour in Northern Greece.\n29 European countries now allow medical cannabis via prescription and the European cannabis market is ex-pected to reach $7.25 billion per annum by 2029. Sales of Hellenic Dynamics' dried THC-dominant cannabis flowers and extracts are initially intended for export into Europe, in addition to other international markets and domestically in Greece.\nAs the first medical cannabis cultivator to obtain a listing on the main market for listed securities of the Lon-don Stock Exchange, Hellenic Dynamics is significantly different to the number of CBD (Cannabidiol) related companies that have appeared over the recent years. Hellenic Dynamics cultivates THC-dominant medical cannabis flowers. THC-dominant medical cannabis products are only available via a medical prescription. Medicinal cannabis has been approved for use both in the United Kingdom and Germany, plus 24 other Euro-pean countries, for conditions including but not limited to chronic pain, intractable chemotherapy-related",

The Facility, cultivation and business model\nDuring Q4 of 2023, the Company completed its Phase 1 fit out of its 195,506 square metre medical cannabis facility (the \"Facility\") which included:\n-\nthe installation of all utilities including new water pump houses;\n-\nconnection of water to all buildings;\n-\nthe installation of a second power substation and additional power connections to all buildings;\n-\nthe construction and fit out of a new fertigation building utilising Priva technology;\n-\nthe installation of a reverse osmosis machines for the pumping of treated water and nutrients to all cultivation buildings; and\n-\nthe completion of one bunker for flowering, and one bunker for flowering and the cultivation of clones from selected mother plants using Fluence, OC Agri and Mitsubishi equipment among others.\nDuring the course of 2024, the Company has continued to develop the Facility through the installation of Ultraviolet pass boxes in each of its flowering, and flowering and mother rooms (being specific parts of the Facility dedicated to the cloning of original genetic material of any cultivator to go onto cultivation) to minimise any potential contamination including microbiology. In addition, Hellenic Dynamics has installed pharmaceutical-grade air showers throughout all cultivation buildings for personnel decontamination, again to minimise contamination. These measures help to guarantee a very high standard of microbiology controls, which is essential to allow for the production of a consistent pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis product.\nThe Company initially intends to cultivate from two bunkers covering a total area of 600 square meters and together are capable of producing up to 75kg of medical cannabis flowers per cultivation cycle and the Company anticipates six cultivation cycles per annum. Prior to the Company being in a position to commence commercial cultivation the Company needs to complete works to its post-harvest area which involves the installation of prefabricated internal walls to the nominated existing building on the facility along with the insulation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (\"HVAC\") and drying equipment (\"Works\").\nIn a situation where an in-house post-harvest area needs to be completed and in order to complete the Works to bring the Facility to a stage where commercial sales and cultivation can commence the Company will need to raise additional funds of approximately \u00a31.25 million (in addition to the \u20ac1 million long term loan announced on 22 April 2024) split as to approximately \u00a3600,000 for the Works and approximately \u00a3650,000 for general working capital purposes assuming the Works are completed within a four month timeframe.\nIt is expected that the Works should take approximately four\nmonths to complete once sufficient funds have been raised.\nOnce the Works have been completed, the Company will be in a position to commence commercial cultivation where it expects to be able to achieve approximately\nsix cultivation cycles per annum producing circa 450kg of medical cannabis flowers per annum in this first phase from the two bunkers which are operational.\nIn order to expedite commercial cultivation, Hellenic is in advanced discussions pertaining to a partnership for a fully certified EU-GMP post-harvest facility in Greece. If the Company secures an agreement on suitable commercial terms, commercial cultivation could be brought forward by up to four months with commencement likely to occur Q3 2024, and reduce the funding required by over \u00a3600,000.\nFollowing completion of the Works or partnership agreement, commercial cultivation of THC dominant strains of medical cannabis flowers is planned to take place and sold under a white label programme to the Company's identified licensed distributors, which in this phase and due to the higher sales revenues and other factors outlined below, will likely be domestically in Greece (prior to any revenues from the export of medical cannabis products), based on legislation changes outlined below. The bunkers represent cultivation areas outside of the Company's announced Product Outsourcing and Development (\"POD\") strategy.\nThe Company is however, also looking to progress its POD strategy in tandem with its own commercial cultivation. Under the POD strategy medical cannabis distributors can enter into a contract with the Company to have their own dedicated white label cultivation facilities by way of a Hellenic Dynamics POD where the cultivation is overseen",

The Company will use the funds available from the Loan Agreement for working capital purposes and to complete the current phase of investment at the Hellenic facility, including financing the first stage of additional cultivation capacity, which will allow the Company to bring in-house further commercial cultivation and research and development testing of strains to the 195,596 square meter Hellenic facility in northern Greece.\nThe Loan Agreement provides financing of EUR 1 million to the Company with an annual interest rate of 3.5% with a repayment period of 180 months.\u00a0For the first 6 months, repayments will be on an 'interest only' basis following which principal and interest will be repaid. The Loan Agreement is guaranteed through an insurance policy with one of the world's largest insurance companies. The Company will pay an insurance fee of EUR 25,000, or 2.5% of the total loan amount, on entering into the Loan Agreement.\nThe loan is subject to penalties and termination provisions in the event of default and other events usual in an agreement of this nature.\nThe Loan Agreement is one part of the wider investment strategy adopted by Hellenic, where the Company is in conversations with other funders, one being Piraeus Bank S.A. as announced on 17 January 2024..

The commitment to a 15-year loan underpins the approach that the Company is taking to deliver high quality cannabis products into the global markets. We are also in advanced discussions on additional financing with a number of parties for expedited growth and further announcements will be released to the market in due course.\"\nThe Directors of the Company take responsibility for this announcement.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as amended by regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310.

It is expected that the 125,300,000 New Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.\n001 each will be admitted to trading and dealings will commence on the London Stock Exchange at or around 8:00 a.m. today.\nAs a result of the Capital Reorganisation, Shareholders will receive 1 New Ordinary Share in substitution for every 100 Existing Ordinary Shares held. The New Ordinary Shares have the same rights as the Existing Ordinary Shares, including voting, dividend and other rights. Immediately following the implementation of the Capital Reorganisation, it is expected that the market price of a New Ordinary Share should be approximately equal to a multiple of 100 times the market price of an Existing Ordinary Share immediately beforehand. Existing Shareholders will own the same proportion of the Company as they did immediately prior to the implementation of the Capital Reorganisation, subject only to fractional rounding.\nAs at 27 November 2023, the Company's issued ordinary share capital consists of 125,300,000 ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 each and therefore the total number of voting rights in the Company, attributable to such ordinary shares, is 125,300,000. This figure should be used by shareholders as the denominator for calculations by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCapitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meanings shall have the meanings set out in the Circular, which is available on the Company's website at:\nhttps://www.hellenicdynamics.com\nThe Directors of the Company take responsibility for this announcement.\nEnquires:\nHellenic Dynamics plc\n+44 (0)20 3818 7850\nDavinder Rai\ndavinder@hellenicdynamics.com\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 (0)20 7213 0880\nEmily Staples / Jo Turner\nPeterhouse Capital\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\nLucy Williams / Charles Goodfellow\nAbout Hellenic Dynamics plc\nFounded in 2019, Hellenic Dynamics is specifically focused on the cultivation and supply of THC (\"tetrahydrocannabinol\") - dominant strains of medical cannabis flowers, destined for the growing medical cannabis markets across\u00a0Europe.

A First Advance of $450,000 has been made available immediately, which the Company has today requested be drawn down, and a Second Advance of US$300,000 may be drawn down by the Company within the next 150 days. As the Facility allows for the principle amounts to be repaid in cash or a mechanism for them to be repaid in shares, a condition of the Facility is that the Company must be in a position to be able to issue new shares. Therefore, in conjunction with entering the Facility, the Company has today posted a circular to all shareholders containing a Notice of General Meeting (\"Notice\") and Form of Proxy for shareholders to consider and, if thought fit, approve a capital reorganisation to allow the Company to access the full extent of the Facility.

The Company is pleased to advise that it has made significant cost savings against its initial budget for the purchase of plant and equipment which are in excess of the value of the CLN. As a result of these cost savings, the Company proposed to the holder to repay the CLN in full, which Rami Ajami has accepted.\nThe CLN has now therefore been redeemed in its entirety.\nBackground\nWith effect from 5 December 2022, Rami Ajami, who is also an existing shareholder, subscribed for the CLN in the Company.\nUnder the terms of the subscription agreement for the CLN, conversion of the CLN would have resulted in:\n\u00b7\nthe issue of 125,000,000 new ordinary shares (\"Conversion Shares\") in the Company at \u00a30.003;\n\u00b7\nthe issue of 125,000,000 warrants at an exercise price of \u00a30.003 for a period of two years if converted within the first 9 months from admission; and\n\u00b7\nthe transfer of 125,000,000 Top-Up Shares (as defined in the Company's prospectus\ndated\n14 November 2022 (\"Prospectus\")\n) from existing Hellenic shareholders held in escrow (\"Escrow Shares\"), if converted within the first 9 months from admission.\nAfter taking careful consideration of the recent significant cost savings referred to above, the Board unanimously approved proposing to Rami Ajami the repayment of the CLN in full. Progression of the Company's strategy, as detailed in its Prospectus\nand as amended by recent announcements, is therefore not impacted by this repayment.\nFurthermore, as the CLN has now been repaid rather than converted, neither the Conversion Shares nor the Conversion Warrants will be issued and the Escrow Shares will be returned to the founding shareholders.\nAs announced on 13 June 2023, the Company continues to advance its Product Outsourcing Development (\"POD\") concept and it is also pleased to advise that it is in late stage discussions with a number of funding sources, which include the application of a number of grants, which, if successful, will not only provide sufficient working capital for the accelerated construction of the initial PODs but also place the Company in a stronger working capital position than it was on admission.\nThe Company previously secured a number of unused post harvest area equipment, as part of the final aspects of completion of its facility which has provided significant cost savings. The Company is on track to produce its first harvest for commercial sale, under its existing off-take agreements, in line with its previous announcements, within Q2 of the Company's fiscal year.\nThe Company will update the market with details of further POD agreements in due course.\nDavinder Rai, CEO of Hellenic Dynamics, commented:\n\"\nGiven our concerted effort to preserve capital and build a platform for growth for shareholders\n, as per our announcement dated 6 June 2023, we have previously made significant savings in the procurement of construction and equipment, thus we are in a position to repay this CLN without any dilution to our shareholders. Further to the Company's previous announcement dated 13 June 2023, the Company has also made an application for two grants both domestically in Greece and at EU level along with entering into advanced discussion with a well-known financial provider to support the acceleration of our contract cultivation PODs by way of a capital financing instrument.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as amended by regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310.

          "full_content": "13 Jun 2023 07:00\nRNS Number : 4750C\nHellenic Dynamics PLC\n13 June 2023\nHellenic Dynamics plc\n(\"Hellenic Dynamics\" or the \"Company\")\nSigning of MoU with Demecan Holding (\"Demecan\")\n-\nDemecan is the only vertically integrated independent German company licensed to grow, process and distribute medical cannabis in Germany\n-\nMoU is the first commercial agreement under Hellenic's expanded strategy into contract cultivation\n-\nAdvanced discussions underway with a number of other licenced European distributors for POD agreements\nLondon, 13 June 2023:\nHellenic Dynamics plc (LSE: HELD), the specialist cultivator and supplier of\ntetrahydrocannabinol (\"\nTHC\") dominant strains of medical cannabis flowers, announces it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with Deutsche Medizinalcannabis GmbH which trades as Demecan Holding for the cultivation and supply of medical cannabis flowers.\nDemecan is the only licensed independent German company that covers the entire value chain for medical cannabis from cultivation through processing to distribution. Demecan works with producers of medical cannabis worldwide to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of medical cannabis for patients in Germany.\nThis MoU represents the first commercial agreement for Hellenic Dynamics under the expanded contract cultivation strategy it announced last week whereby it will allow, for the first time, medical cannabis distributors to have their own dedicated white label cultivation facilities by way of a Hellenic Dynamics Product Outsourcing Development (\"POD\") agreement.\nUnder the MoU, Hellenic Dynamics will grow and supply medical cannabis flowers from Demecan provided cultivars in an indoor cultivation area of 1,000 square meters capable of producing circa 1,200 kg of medical cannabis flowers per annum under Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (\"GACP\"). Demecan will then process the delivered flowers in its own EU-GMP facilities for onward sale to the German market. It is anticipated that the binding agreement with Demecan will be in place in line with Hellenic Dynamics' cultivation strategy, as per the Company's previous announcement.\nHellenic Dynamics is also in discussions with a number of other licensed European distributors, who have their own GMP processing facilities for similar POD agreements. The model allows distributors to fully define the specific type of medical cannabis they want to receive using either Hellenic Dynamics' strains or the distributor's own strains. Hellenic Dynamics will then cultivate and despatch directly to the distributor, branded under the distributor's chosen brand name. It is currently anticipated that customers will be contractually obliged to take a POD area for a minimum of two years.\nThis outsourced model\nmeans that Hellenic Dynamics\nhandles the entire fit out of the POD and all cultivation requirements, with oversight from the distributor if they so wish. Hellenic Dynamics' distributor customers can also benefit from certain of the Company's relationships, for example the recent MoU agreement it has with ELGO-DIMITRA, the Institute of Plant Breeding and Genetic Resources located near Thessaloniki in Greece, which may enable POD owners to have their products registered and IP protected in Europe.\nUnder this strategy of white label cultivation, Hellenic Dynamics intends to have a select number of distributors utilising a POD agreement, while the Company will continue as planned to produce its own crop of medical cannabis plants. The medical cannabis markets in Europe are rapidly evolving and in the last 18 months cultivators have been struggling with soaring energy costs. In addition, many distributors have been building their own EU-GMP facilities. As mentioned in the last Company announcement, Hellenic Dynamics, in adapting with the market changes, has seen fit to expand its strategy to include the production of customised GACP products cutting down its production cost and the time to deliver products, which should enhance the business turnover and generate earlier cash flows. This strategy also allows the Company to diversify and accelerate cash flows whilst strengthening its relationships with a number of key distributors across Europe and establish production at scale.\nHellenic Dynamics remains committed to excellence and compliance across its cultivation value chain.\nFurther details on the POD expanded cultivation strategy can be found at:\nhttps://www.hellenicdynamics.com/investor/#s4\nDavinder Rai, CEO of Hellenic Dynamics, commented:\n\"This POD agreement represents\u00a0another development\u00a0in the future of the Company's medical cannabis cultivation and underpins the long-term value inherent in the business and our operating model.\u00a0We can allow distributors to grow the products they want in their own dedicated white label cultivation areas, which we then ship to their EU-GMP facilities for processing\u00a0enabling us to widen our client base and creating more value for our shareholders.\"\nEnquires",

In December 2022, Hellenic Dynamics became the first medical cannabis cultivator to list on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nCultivation and Equipment\n\u00b7\nDetails of adapted Strategy to the changing dynamics of the European medical cannabis market\n\u00b7\nUpdate on GMP Certification\n\u00b7\nRenewable Energy Update\nHellenic Dynamics' Business Model\nHellenic\u00a0Dynamics' core strategy is to\u00a0develop and operate its 40,000 square metre cultivation area for THC-dominant medical cannabis permitted by its licence from its 195,506 square metre\u00a0facility located near Thessaloniki in Northern Greece.\nThe facility benefits from a relatively low cost base resulting from\u00a0a comparatively low cost of power\nand\none of the lowest labour rates for skilled and semi-skilled labour in Europe\nas well as having its own running water supply, meaning that utility costs are significantly below standard market rates for other cultivators.\nThe active THC cultivation area is one of the largest in Europe, capable of producing over 54,000 kg of dried medical cannabis flowers per annum when in full production.\nThe location of the facility also enables Hellenic\u00a0Dynamics to easily export its THC dominant medical flowers to any of the 25 countries in Europe that\u00a0currently allow medical cannabis prescriptions to patients, in a market expected to reach \u20ac43.3 billion per annum by 2027, twice the size of the current north American and Canadian markets combined.\nHellenic Dynamics' adapted strategy\nHellenic Dynamics is currently on track to have its first cultivation underway in late summer 2023.\nHellenic Dynamics is a medical cannabis cultivator. As the industry enters 'cannabis 2.0' which has seen a shake-up of the medical cannabis market, through its agility the Company intends to move with market conditions and demand. This has led to a review of the Company's cultivation strategy which will see Hellenic Dynamics harnessing its scale and low cost operating model in a way that it anticipates will accelerate revenue generation and provide an opportunity to itscustomers. Such a strategy has not yet seen in the cannabis space to date. This modified strategy and operating model, details of which are set out below, is different and disruptive in comparison to the Company's peer group and is designed to match the rapidly evolving regulated medical cannabis market in Europe.\nAs the medical cannabis markets across Europe are now defining the industry standard for the supply of medical cannabis products from cultivator to patient, the certifications for these products is also evolving. Hellenic Dynamics' strategy contained within the Company's prospectus was to gain both Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (\"GACP\") and a EU Good Manufacturing Practices (\"EU-GMP\") certifications. EU-GMP is the most intensive certification for any medical cannabis cultivator to achieve from a capex, opex and time to issuance perspective, with very little advantages for end sales price of products. As the industry enters 'cannabis 2.0' many medical distributors have built their own EU-GMP facilities within their licensed distribution buildings across Germany as have other potential customers in the other markets that Hellenic Dynamics wishes to sell its products into. For this reason, the Company has decided not to invest considerable funds and time into the construction and certification of an EU-GMP facility in the current phase of its development. Hellenic will instead concentrate on the cultivation and supply of GACP flowers to its EU-GMP certified distributors, saving the Company considerable time and expense. This again shows the evolving nature of the European cannabis markets.\nThe Company will release more details of its adapted cultivation strategy in due course.\nCost savings\nIn addition, since the Company's last business update, Hellenic Dynamics has managed to secure significant discounts from its equipment suppliers and has also managed to secure unused second hand equipment, where possible, to keep costs as low as possible while ensuring all equipment is of the highest and modern standards throughout the facility.\nThe Company already benefits from a relatively low cost of power, however Hellenic Dynamics is in advanced discussion with suppliers of solar energy from within Greece to further reduce its cost base. This potential new supply should bring the Company's energy cost down even lower and provide a unique advantage to its business model.\nThe Company will update the market on progress with this",

It is the intention that, through this research, new varieties and species of cannabis with improved yield, quality and adaptability will be created.\nIn the event that the parties agree to jointly undertake specific projects or collaborations, in the context of the MoU, a separate written contract will be drawn up which will define the obligations and responsibilities of each party.\nHellenic Dynamics believes that by jointly researching medical cannabis flowers with\nELGO-DIMITRA\nat the Company's facility, Hellenic may be able to exploit the joint research in seeking registration of its specific medical cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol (\"THC\") dominant genetics onto the Greek national genetics database. This in turn could lead to Hellenic Dynamics in future gaining Intellectual Property (\"IP\") protection on certain genetics, which the Company believes could be enforceable across Europe.\nThe ambition of Hellenic Dynamics remains to define certain THC dominant medical cannabis flowers cultivated at the Company's production facility in Greece against specific pain and other indicators in patients. This cooperation agreement with ELGO-DIMITRA could add significant upside to the Company and help accelerate its ambition if efficacy in patients can be identified.\nThis MoU, is in addition to Hellenic Dynamics's near-term plan to be the dominant cultivator of competitively priced THC dominant medical cannabis flowers in Europe, where the rapidly growing medical cannabis markets are\nexpected to reach \u20ac43.3 billion per annum by 2027\n.\nIn December 2022, Hellenic Dynamics became the first medical cannabis cultivator to list on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities.\nDavinder Rai, CEO of Hellenic Dynamics, commented:\n\"This MoU with ELGO-DIMITRA is very exciting as it means the Company could gain IP protection on its strains of THC medical cannabis flowers which could be incredibly valuable , especially if efficacy can be shown in patients against specific pain indicators.\"\nProfessor Serkos Haroutounian, President of the board\nELGO-DIMITRA\n, commented:\n\"The experienced and specialized staff of ELGO\n-\nDIMITRA's Research Institute provide knowledge and contributes to the development of the agricultural production of Greece.

Otherwise it is preferential treatment surely in my opinion?   Does anyone know what the judgement was based upon? Its tough on smallholders when the cost of an action is more than your holding.",

This sets a dangerous precedent for any Shareholder who is / has lost monies on a stock they have bought into and the sed Stock Price starts to decline   imo. I dont think the company have helped with their silence   on the matter but maybe with the sensitivity of the matter they have been silenced. I dont think there is any way back now for the company     its just been a train wreck waiting to happen",

If the argument is that a fraud occurred then that would affect ALL Ordinary Shareholders not just him, surely the liquidator and court should consider this? Otherwise it is preferential treatment surely in my opinion?   Does anyone know what the judgement was based upon? Its tough on smallholders when the cost of an action is more than your holding.",
