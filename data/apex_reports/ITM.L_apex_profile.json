The calculation methodology is set out in\nNote 3.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM, said:\n\"We have yet again delivered our strongest six-month revenue performance to date while maintaining strict cash and operational discipline.\nIn the first half of the financial year, commercial activity has progressed well with the award of multiple equipment supply contracts, several engineering contracts, a significant capacity reservation from RWE, an important repeat customer, and beyond that our selection as electrolyser provider for several other upcoming projects. This progress underpins customer confidence and market traction in an environment which had to fight with known headwinds.\nThe Hydropulse business was well received at its launch and has since progressed several project discussions, supporting ITM's move towards recurring profitable revenue. Furthermore, Hydropulse is lining itself up to play a role in various government-backed funding programmes including HAR3 in the UK and various schemes in Germany.\nQ4 saw the launch of our new product, ALPHA 50, the world's most competitive full-scope and highly efficient green hydrogen plant solution, which has generated strong interest among large-scale industrial customers.\nWhile FID timing, of course, remains customer-led, we are closely engaged with our customers across many projects, and we expect FID momentum to continue accelerating through 2026 and beyond.\nCHRONOS, our next-generation stack platform, has continued to progress through development and validation to plan. We are confident that, once launched, CHRONOS will be a true gamechanger for the electrolyser industry.\nProject progress has been solid. To pick a few: The world's most advanced and largest PEM electrolyser plant, Lingen 1, for RWE has seen all 100 MW of TRIDENT stacks and skids installed and pressure-tested on time. For the second 100 MW, Lingen 2, all TRIDENT skids and already 40% of the stacks have been installed. The Leuna project with Linde is also nearing completion.\nThere is no doubt that green hydrogen will play an essential role in the decarbonisation of global industries and energy systems. Despite wider macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, clean hydrogen continues to progress at pace, with committed investments having risen elevenfold from $10bn to $110bn between 2020 and 2025\n[1]\n. Growth remains strongly supported by policy, increasing industrial demand, and ongoing sector consolidation - strengthening the foundations for a more resilient and commercially viable market.\"\nDennis Schulz, Amy Grey, and Simon Bourne will present to analysts and investors at 9:00 a.m. GMT.\nThe presentation will be via the Investor Meet Company platform.

Morgan Cazenove\nRichard Perelman, Charles Oakes\n+44 (0) 20 7742 4000\nAbout ITM Power plc:\nITM Power was founded in 2000 and ITM Power plc was admitted to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in 2004. Headquartered in Sheffield, England, ITM Power designs and manufactures electrolysers based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology to produce green hydrogen, the only net zero energy gas, using renewable electricity and water.\nINTERIM REVIEW\nOperational update\nWe have continued to strengthen operational execution, disciplined cost management and capital allocation. We have also continued to advance our market-leading technology and product portfolio. This tangible progress underpins our ability to deliver high-quality, scalable electrolysers at highly competitive cost, positioning us for sustained margin improvement.\n\u00b7\nProcess and capabilities:\nWe continue to focus on manufacturing quality and process control. In parallel, we have halved electrolysis time during Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT), increasing throughput and reducing energy costs. We have received and installed our new autostacker manufacturing line, a key next step in automation that substantially reduces manual work in stack assembly. The new autostacker has a stack assembly capability of over 2 GW.\n\u00b7\nProduct portfolio:\nTowards the end of H1, we launched ALPHA 50, our flagship 50 MW full-scope green hydrogen plant, designed to set a new benchmark for cost-competitive, industrial-scale hydrogen production. Priced at only \u20ac50m, ALPHA 50 is materially more competitive than comparable solutions, regardless of technology or supplier. Customer interest has exceeded expectations, with discussions underway across multiple projects spanning a broad customer base. We expect ALPHA 50 to be just as successful as our most sought-after product NEPTUNE V.\n\u00b7\nTechnology development:\nDevelopment of CHRONOS, our next-generation stack platform, continues in line with planned milestones for development and validation. CHRONOS remains central to ITM's roadmap to lower plant Capex and Opex, enhancing performance and expanding the addressable market.\n\u00b7\nSales pipeline:\nOur sales pipeline remains robust, with strong demand for NEPTUNE V, our containerised 5 MW electrolyser plant. The launch of ALPHA 50 has further strengthened the depth and quality of the pipeline. Subsequent to the half-year, ITM was awarded a contract with Octopus Energy Generation for three NEPTUNE V units to decarbonise yet another hard-to-abate industrial application.\nHydropulse:\nOur new BOO platform has been well received by customers. The business has established offices in Berlin and Sheffield and is building an experienced team to support project origination and delivery. Hydropulse is developing several projects, with strong and growing customer interest. Hydropulse will contribute recurring, asset-backed revenue and profit streams.\nHydropulse is destined to play a role in various government funding programmes including HAR3 in the UK and various schemes in Germany.\nIncome statement\nHistorically, ITM has recognised revenue under the completed-contracts method, at specific milestones such as delivery, testing or commissioning, depending on individual contract terms. This approach has historically resulted in lumpy revenue recognition, with timing influenced by customer actions and project milestones.\nAs our product portfolio has expanded and matured, we have reviewed the appropriateness of this methodology for new contracts. While TRIDENT and standard NEPTUNE products are expected to continue under the completed-contract approach, non-standard NEPTUNE, POSEIDON, and ALPHA products are increasingly suited to a percentage-of-completion (PoC) method, enabling revenue to be recognised progressively over the life of the contract.\nThis transition is underway and is strategically important as it aligns revenue recognition with value creation, improves revenue visibility, and reduces dependency on end-point customer actions, supporting a more predictable financial profile as the business scales.\nThe percentage of profitable contracts in our contracted order backlog continues to grow, now standing at 71%, up from 60% in April 2025. The remaining legacy projects, which do not contribute to margin but are fully provided for, are expected to be recognised over the next 18 months.\nRevenue for the period was \u00a318.0m (H1 2025: \u00a315.5m). Of this, \u00a315.5m is from equipment sale contracts, of which \u00a313.9m of this is recognised using the completed-contracts method, driven predominantly by deliveries against Lingen 1, and \u00a31.6m from equipment sale contracts which are recognised over time.\nIncome of \u00a31.1m (H1 2025: \u00a30.2m) was received from maintenance and upgrades, while \u00a31.4m (H1 2025: \u00a31.1m) was recognised from engineering contracts.\nThe gross loss was \u00a36.5m (H1 2025: \u00a310.2m), predominantly due to the under-absorption of factory costs.\nThe Company posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of \u00a311.9m (H1 2025: \u00a316.8m) for the period. The administrative expenses presented in the income statement are net of costs booked to inventory or development costs.\nThe loss before tax was \u00a314.1m (H1 2025: \u00a328.8m), the prior year includes exceptional costs in the period.\nCash flow and balance sheet\nCapital expenditure totalled \u00a36.9m in the period (H1 2025: \u00a35.4m), with \u00a34.5m (H1 2025: \u00a33.4m) invested in fixed assets and investment in new product development (intangible assets) of \u00a32.4m (H1 2025: \u00a32.0m).\nThe working capital inflow in the first half was \u00a312.7m, with receivables and payables increasing by \u00a37.1m and \u00a314.9m respectively, offset by a decrease in inventories of \u00a34.9m.\nInventories held decreased to \u00a351.1m from \u00a373.0m in the prior year and \u00a356.0m at 30 April 2025. The inventory has primarily been processed into finished subsystems and products, with the raw materials balance reducing from \u00a37.8m (31 October 2025) to \u00a34.3m.\nCash at 31 October 2025 was \u00a3198m (31 October 2024: \u00a3203m), representing an outflow since the year-end of \u00a39.2m as we continued manufacturing customer commitments for which cash had been received in previous periods. Finance income in the period was \u00a34.1m (H1 2025: \u00a35.5m), representing an annual average interest rate of c.4%.\nMarket update\nIt is clear that hydrogen will play a critical role in the energy transition and industrial decarbonisation. In many sectors, only a few viable alternatives exist. Refining, ammonia, heavy industry and industrial heat are structurally difficult to decarbonise, and electrification alone will be insufficient to achieve global net-zero ambitions, positioning green hydrogen as an essential solution. The same applies to grid balancing in an increasingly green and fluctuating electricity mix.\nIn September 2025, the International Energy Agency noted that, while deployment has been slower than originally targeted, the hydrogen sector continues to demonstrate progress and reach key milestones, rather than stalling. Importantly, the IEA highlighted that Europe has the world's largest project pipeline, accounting for nearly one-quarter of announced global production capacity by 2030, underlining the scale and durability of regional demand. The Hydrogen Council and McKinsey have tracked global clean hydrogen project investments and highlighted an elevenfold increase from $10bn to $110bn between 2020 and 2025, representing a massive and accelerating growth.\nAt the EU level, the regulatory framework continues to mature in favour of green hydrogen adoption. Under the Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III), the EU mandates that 42% of hydrogen used in industry must be renewable by 2030, alongside a 1% renewable hydrogen requirement in transport fuels. From January 2026, the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requires carbon costs to be paid on imported emissions-intensive products, while free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) will be progressively reduced, structurally improving the competitiveness of green hydrogen in heavy industry.\nThe EU is also reinforcing this regulatory push with material funding support. In December, \u20ac5.2bn of EU ETS proceeds were allocated across three new programmes, including \u20ac2.9bn for clean technology manufacturing and industrial decarbonisation under the Innovation Fund, \u20ac1.3bn for the third EU Hydrogen Bank auction, and c.\u20ac1.8bn of national co-funding from Germany and Spain for hydrogen and industrial heat projects. Together, these measures provide long-term demand visibility, funding depth, and bankability for large-scale green hydrogen deployment.\nIn the UK, the government reaffirmed its commitment to hydrogen at the November Budget, including plans to publish an updated UK Hydrogen Strategy and to launch HAR3 in 2026 and HAR4 from 2028, providing ongoing visibility on revenue support mechanisms. In addition, GB Energy published its strategic plan in December, targeting the mobilisation of \u00a315bn of private capital by 2030, including \u00a31bn earmarked for clean energy technologies.\nTangible progress continues across projects supported under HAR1. In August, the company announced a supply agreement with MorGen Energy for the 20 MW West Wales Hydrogen project, followed in December by a 12.5 MW contract with Octopus Energy Generation to deploy NEPTUNE V systems at Kimberly-Clark's Northfleet manufacturing site. Progress has also been made on HAR2 shortlisted projects, including FEED contracts announced in October for a multi-unit NEPTUNE V deployment and for Uniper's 120 MW Humber H2ub\u00ae project, supporting future commercial momentum.\nBoard changes\nIn October, the Board was strengthened by the appointment of Sir Warren East and John Howarth as Non-Executive Directors, while Denise Cockrem stepped down.

Whilst the financial information has been compiled in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of UK-adopted international accounting standards (IFRSs), it does not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRSs. This interim financial information does not constitute statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 435 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information has\nbeen prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are as applied in the Group's latest audited financial statements.\nAs permitted, this interim report has been prepared in accordance with the AIM rules and not in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim financial reporting\".\nThe information relating to the year ended 30 April 2025 has been extracted from the Group's published financial statements for that year, which contain an unqualified audit report that does not draw attention to any matters of emphasis, and did not contain statements under section 498(2) and 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006 and which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies.\nSelected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at the year ended 30 April 2025.\nGoing Concern\nThe Directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the period ending 31 January 2027. This forecast indicates that the Group and parent company would expect to remain cash positive without the requirement for further fund raising based on delivering the existing pipeline, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these summary accounts.\nBy the end of the period analysed, the Group expect to hold funds sufficient to trade for a minimum of a further year if the business continued to operate in a similar way beyond the forecast period.\nThis cash flow forecast has also been stress tested. As a worst-case scenario, if all payments had to continue as forecast while receipts were not received at all, the business would remain cash positive for the full twelve months from the date of approval of these summary accounts.\nThe interim summary accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.\n2.\nRevenue and other operating income\nAn analysis of the Group's revenue is as follows:\nSix months to 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue from product sales recognised over time\n1,567\n-\n-\nRevenue from product sales recognised at point in time\n13,962\n13,820\n22,533\nEngineering contracts recognised at point in time\n1,393\n1,072\n1,755\nMaintenance contracts recognised at point in time\n1,104\n208\n900\nFuel sales\n-\n94\n131\nOther\n-\n340\n721\nRevenue in the Consolidated Income Statement\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nGrant income (claims made for projects)\n259\n24\n85\nOther government grants (R&D claims)\n300\n271\n3,335\nGrant income in the Consolidated Income Statement\n559\n295\n3,420\n18,585\n15,829\n29,460\nThe \"Other\" category includes contractual revenues recognised at point in time but not classified elsewhere as not involving the transfer of goods or the completion of maintenance or consultancy services.\nRevenues from major products and services\nThe Group's revenues from its major products and services were as follows:\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nPower\n12,755\n74\n1,911\nTransport\n2,339\n251\n1,401\nIndustry\n1,888\n13,896\n20,379\nOther\n1,044\n1,313\n2,349\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nThe \"Other\" category contains consultancy values that cannot be allocated to a single product group.\nGEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nA geographical analysis of the Group's revenue is set out below:\nSix months to 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended\n30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nUnited Kingdom\n2,349\n985\n1,627\nGermany\n15,319\n11,966\n21,306\nRest of Europe\n289\n774\n1,299\nJapan\n-\n1,672\n1,672\nRest of World\n69\n137\n136\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nThe table has been restated for the prior periods to combine individual countries into the rest of world category, where amounts were not individually material.\nThe following accounted for more than 10% of total revenue:\nSix months to 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nCustomer A\n<10%\n10,753\n10,753\nCustomer B\n12,571\nN/A\nN/A\nCustomer C\nN/A\n1,672\n<10%\nCustomer D\n<10%\nN/A\n9,037\n3.\nCalculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nIn reporting EBITDA, management use the metric of adjusted EBITDA, removing the effect of the non-repeating costs that are not directly linked to the trading performance of the business in the period under review:\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nLoss from operations\n(17,437)\n(33,787)\n(54,541)\nAdd back:\nDepreciation\n2,830\n2,329\n4,927\nAmortisation\n1,330\n1,188\n2,454\n(Gain) / loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n688\n-\n(10)\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\nNon-underlying share-based payment charge\n710\n403\n1,053\nExceptional Items\n-\n13,083\n13,090\n(11,879)\n(16,784)\n(33,027)\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative performance measure (APM) as it allows better monitoring of the operations.

The discount applied to this is amortising over the lease term.\nThe warranty provision represents management's best estimate of the Group's liability under warranties granted on products, based on knowledge of the products and their components gained both through internal testing and monitoring of equipment in the field. As with any product warranty, there is an inherent uncertainty around the likelihood and timing of a fault occurring that would trigger further work or part replacement. Warranties are usually granted for a period of one year, although two-year warranties are the standard within some jurisdictions.\nThe provision for contract losses is created when it becomes known that a commercial contract has become onerous. The provision is based on best estimates and information known at the time to ensure the expected losses are recognised immediately through profit and loss. The effects of discounting on non-current balances were not deemed to be material. The provision created in the year is allocated against two projects. This provision will be used to offset the costs of the project as it reaches completion in future periods. Contract loss provisions are recognised as greater than one year based on the expected completion of the contract.\nProvision is also made at the point when project forecasts suggest that the contractual clauses for liquidated damages might be triggered. The other provisions category relates to potential liquidated damages for overruns on contracts with customers. The release last year was attributable to renegotiations of contract terms. The provision also represents management's best current estimate of monies that could be refundable to grant bodies for non-completion of works.\nLastly, there is a provision for Employer's NIC due on share options as they exercise.\n6.\nNotes to the Cashflow Statement\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nLoss from operations\n(17,436)\n(33,787)\n(54,541)\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n2,830\n2,332\n4,927\nLoss / (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n688\n-\n(10)\nAmortisation\n1,330\n1,189\n2,454\nShare based payment (as seen through equity)\n494\n382\n980\nForeign exchange on intercompany transactions\n(8)\n(178)\n(80)\nOperating cash flows before\nmovements in working capital\n(12,102)\n(30,062)\n(46,270)\nDecrease / (increase) in inventories\n4,888\n(2,583)\n14,408\n(Increase) / decrease in receivables\n(7,132)\n4,521\n7,808\nIncrease / (decrease) in payables\n14,941\n(959)\n12,074\n(Decrease) / increase in provisions\n(5,642)\n2,542\n(7,121)\nCash used in operations\n(5,047)\n(26,541)\n(19,101)\nInterest paid\n(679)\n(471)\n(919)\nIncome taxes paid\n(189)\n-\n-\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(5,915)\n(27,012)\n(20,020)\nCash Burn\nCash burn is a measure used by key management personnel to monitor the performance of the business.\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025 (audited)\n\u00a3'000\nDecrease in Cash and Cash equivalents per the cash flow statement\n(9,175)\n(27,223)\n(23,339)\nEffect of foreign exchange rates\n(18)\n9\n32\nLess share issue proceeds (net)\n-\n(118)\n(118)\nCash Burn\n(9,193)\n(27,332)\n(23,425)\n7.\nRelated Parties\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

The green hydrogen will power a new dual-fuel boiler system at the mill, which can operate on hydrogen or natural gas to generate the steam needed for paper manufacturing.\nThe Northfleet system will be financed through funds managed by Octopus Energy Generation and is being developed through HYRO, Octopus's dedicated green hydrogen development vehicle, created to drive decarbonisation across hard-to-electrify, energy-intensive industries.\nHYRO was awarded funding under the UK Government's Hydrogen Allocation Round 1 (HAR1), and this contract with ITM further advances the project. The facility is anticipated to be operational by the end of the calendar year 2027.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM Power, said\n, \"We are proud that\u00a0Octopus has selected us for this ground-breaking project, which will showcase the role of green hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the hard-to-electrify parts of the UK's manufacturing industry.\"\nAlex Brierley, Co-Head of Octopus Energy Generation's funds team, said,\n\"Heavy industries are a big part of global emissions, and with HYRO, we're determined to tackle this challenge head-on. Seeing Northfleet take shape is a fantastic signal, showcasing how building clean energy infrastructure and strengthening UK industry go hand in hand.\"\nDan Howell, Vice President and Managing Director at Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland, said:\n\"This is a significant investment into a green hydrogen solution, and alongside other investments that support our ambition to move our UK manufacturing operations to 100% renewable energy. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy-intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.

The green hydrogen will power a new dual-fuel boiler system at the mill, which can operate on hydrogen or natural gas to generate the steam needed for paper manufacturing.\nThe Northfleet system will be financed through funds managed by Octopus Energy Generation and is being developed through HYRO, Octopus's dedicated green hydrogen development vehicle, created to drive decarbonisation across hard-to-electrify, energy-intensive industries.\nHYRO was awarded funding under the UK Government's Hydrogen Allocation Round 1 (HAR1), and this contract with ITM further advances the project. The facility is anticipated to be operational by the end of the calendar year 2027.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM Power, said\n, \"We are proud that\u00a0Octopus has selected us for this ground-breaking project, which will showcase the role of green hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the hard-to-electrify parts of the UK's manufacturing industry.\"\nAlex Brierley, Co-Head of Octopus Energy Generation's funds team, said,\n\"Heavy industries are a big part of global emissions, and with HYRO, we're determined to tackle this challenge head-on. Seeing Northfleet take shape is a fantastic signal, showcasing how building clean energy infrastructure and strengthening UK industry go hand in hand.\"\nDan Howell, Vice President and Managing Director at Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland, said:\n\"This is a significant investment into a green hydrogen solution, and alongside other investments that support our ambition to move our UK manufacturing operations to 100% renewable energy. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy-intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.

The two projects will operate exclusively for grid balancing, stabilising the power system, and using underground caverns as hydrogen storage facilities to absorb the discrepancies between electricity supply and hydrogen consumption. This is referred to as \"predispatch\".\nThis mode of operation called \"Netzbr\u00fccke\", or \"grid bridge\", is intended primarily to reduce \"redispatch\". Redispatch is an intervention used to eliminate bottlenecks in the electricity grid. Grid operators adjust power plant output by reducing generation ahead of a congestion point and simultaneously increasing generation behind it. Redispatch has become necessary due to the expansion of renewable energy, whose feed-in is weather-dependent and geographically uneven. Negative redispatch results in annual costs of 2-3 billion Euros to German taxpayers. Reducing these costs to zero while putting surplus energy to meaningful use, \"complementary hybrid redispatch\", short \"predispatch\", contributes substantial cost savings to the expansion of renewable energy.\nIn the first project, \"Netzbr\u00fccke 410\" based in R\u00fcstringen, ITM Power is selected to supply a 30 MW green hydrogen production plant based on its NEPTUNE V containerised electrolysers, including integration works. Stablegrid Group expects to take the final investment decision (FID) on the project in 2026 and has reserved ITM production capacity accordingly.\nThe second project involves installing 680 MW of indoor electrolyser capacity. Stablegrid and ITM Power will begin the pre-FEED work in January 2026. The FID for this second project is anticipated in 2028.\nDennis Schulz, CEO, said: \"Partnering with Stablegrid on these landmark grid balancing projects in Germany reinforces ITM's position at the forefront of the energy transition in Europe's largest economy.\"\nOliver Feller, Member of the Management Board of Stablegrid Group, said: \"With ITM Power, we have a strong and experienced partner at our side who brings the technical expertise and excellence required to implement system-stabilising hydrogen projects of this magnitude reliably.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.

It follows RWE's operation of our 4MW pilot plant and our ongoing delivery of 200MW of electrolysers for the GetH2 Nukleus project in Lingen, Germany.\nRWE is a leading European energy company with a proven track record of delivering large-scale green hydrogen projects. This agreement signifies important repeat business with a major industrial partner and underlines the growing demand for our products.\nNEPTUNE V is our latest generation containerised, green hydrogen plant solution. Each unit integrates all necessary balance of plant within a compact containerised design, enabling rapid deployment, simplified installation, and reliable operation. NEPTUNE V can be interconnected to form bigger container-based plants. Since its launch last year, the platform has gained strong commercial traction as a benchmark technology for commercial-scale green hydrogen projects.\nThe Company will provide further updates on this agreement as projects are called off and converted into firm orders.\nDennis Schulz, CEO, said: \"We are proud to expand our collaboration with RWE. Building on our strong relationship developed through the joint execution of the GetH2 Nukleus project, this additional 150MW capacity reservation underlines RWE's confidence in our technology and delivery capability.

In doing so, they can offer Hydrogen-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service across the entire value chain from green electrons to green molecules.\nABO Energy and Hydropulse will develop decentralised hydrogen production units on or near end user sites. This includes, among other things, permitting, electricity supply, engineering, construction and operation. Hydropulse will build, own and operate the hydrogen production facilities, while ABO Energy will contribute on the power and development side. This will enable industrial customers to access long-term reliable hydrogen supply without requiring upfront capital investment.\nThe collaboration will be anchored in Europe with a particular focus on Spain and Finland, where low power prices make green hydrogen production attractive. Promising initial projects with an imminent customer need for green hydrogen have already been identified.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM Power, said, \"This is about market traction. With ABO Energy's access to sites and end users, we can realise projects faster and turn our technology into recurring revenues. Our modular approach, combined with ABO Energy's project pipeline, creates a pragmatic route to help industry cut emissions. The partnership will also help us unlock new markets.\"\nKarsten Schlageter, Managing Director of ABO Energy, added: \"It's a breakthrough moment for many hydrogen projects. We can now offer our customers a one-stop solution from development to long-term operation without capex intensity. Many of our projects are already developed to a stage where we can move quickly when the offtake is committed. With Hydropulse on board, we can now offer our customers long-term reliable plant operation with a strong technology partner. This collaboration allows us to fast-track projects and deliver real value for industry.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nABO Energy\nKatja Burger\n+49 (0)611 26765981\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.

Hydropulse will build, own and operate decentralised green hydrogen production plants using ITM's modular NEPTUNE technology, with a focus on serving industrial customers under long-term offtake agreements.\nUnlocking Demand That Others Can't\nMany industrial green hydrogen projects across Europe are facing delays and challenges due to complexity, capital costs, bank financing, and technology risks. Hydropulse offers a simple, scalable solution: green hydrogen as a service, produced directly where it's needed with no capital expenditure, no technology risk, and no operational burden for the offtaker.\nHydropulse plants will be configured around the customer's molecule demand profile and operated via a remote operations centre. Customers retain power procurement or respective price indexation, reducing the market exposure of Hydropulse, and they guarantee long-term hydrogen offtake.\nBenefitting from direct access to ITM Power's market-leading electrolyser systems at highly competitive costs without unnecessary risk buffers or intermediaries, Hydropulse will be able to produce green hydrogen at an exceptionally low price point. This will unlock many projects that struggled to reach Final Investment Decision (FID).\nDesigned for Industry. Built to Scale\nThe Hydropulse business model is tailored for industrial users with dependable hydrogen needs - from mobility applications, chemicals and steel to food processing and refineries. Each project will be built around a guaranteed long-term offtake agreement. Targeted project sizes will be small to mid-size projects. The regional focus will initially be on Europe, specifically Germany, the UK, and the Nordics.\nPowering ITM's Next Phase of Growth\nHydropulse creates a new growth engine for the ITM Group, accelerating its path to profitability with a recurring, high-quality and predictable revenue stream, expanding the addressable market, improving factory utilisation, and creating shareholder value - all while preserving capital discipline.\nHydropulse is not pursuing merchant hydrogen markets, logistics, or speculative refuelling infrastructure. Our focused approach ensures risk is contained and returns are tied to real industrial use cases with dependable demand.\nInitial projects are already under development and will be announced as they mature towards FID.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM Power plc and Managing Director of Hydropulse GmbH, commented, \"With our disciplined and focused approach to electrolyser innovation and manufacturing, we have demonstrated that we possess a deep understanding of the market and the expertise to execute effectively. Approximately 12 months in the making, the launch of Hydropulse opens a new chapter for ITM and the green hydrogen industry. By addressing the bankability hurdle of green hydrogen projects through capital expenditure, operations, and technology risk mitigation for the end user, Hydropulse will solve the most pressing real-world challenges that are holding back exponential industry growth.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.

His extensive experience in large-scale engineering and the international markets aligns strongly with ITM's strategy to further scale and commercialise its technology. J\u00fcrgen served as Linde's nominated Board representative from November 2019 until January 2025 and his new term as Non-Executive Chair will take into account his prior appointment tenure at ITM.\nSir Roger Bone has served as Non-Executive Chair since 2019 and as Non-Executive Director since 2014. During Sir Roger's chairmanship, ITM transitioned from a development-stage company to an established commercial business and market leader in electrolysers, and strengthened its governance and leadership team.\nDennis Schulz, CEO, commented, \"J\u00fcrgen's appointment as Chair signals our ambition. He brings sharp strategic instinct and industry depth. His experience and customer contacts will be invaluable as we execute the next phase of our growth strategy.\n\"On behalf of the Board and the wider ITM team, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his stewardship, wise counsel, and unwavering support over the past years. His commitment and leadership helped guide the Company through a crucial phase of transformation.\"\nJ\u00fcrgen Nowicki said: \"I am deeply honoured to take on the role of Chair at ITM during this pivotal moment in the Company's growth. As we continue to lead the charge in green hydrogen innovation, I firmly believe that this technology will play a central role in the global energy transition. ITM stands at the forefront of this transformation, uniquely positioned with its cutting-edge technology and robust manufacturing capabilities.\n\"Having had the privilege of working with Dennis previously, I'm excited to renew our partnership. Together, we will accelerate ITM's growth and enhance long-term value.\n\"Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his outstanding leadership, commitment, and contributions to ITM. It has truly been an honour working alongside him, and I look forward to building on the strong legacy he leaves.\"\nDirector information\nJ\u00fcrgen Nowicki, aged 61, holds or has held the following directorships/partnerships in the past five years:\nCurrent Directorships/Partnerships\nFormer Directorships/Partnerships (past five years)\nLinde Kryotechnik AG\nLPM, S.a. de C.V.\nLinde Holding GmbH\nLinde GmbH\nITM Power PLC\nCommercium Immobilien - und Beteiligungs - GmbH\nCarl von Linde-Stiftung an der Technischen Universitat Munchen\nSave as set out above, there is no further information to be disclosed in relation to J\u00fcrgen Nowicki's appointment pursuant to AIM Rule 17 or paragraph (g) of Schedule Two of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power PLC\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.

The original cash guidance, issued in August 2024, was between \u00a3160m and \u00a3175m and in January 2025, the guidance was increased to between \u00a3185m and \u00a3195m.\nThe adjusted EBITDA loss guidance of \u00a332m to \u00a336m remains unchanged.\nDennis Schulz, CEO, said, \"ITM is continuing to achieve a strong revenue performance while tightly managing costs and capital expenditures.

Instead, today, the hype has given way to real industrial scale-up of projects and production capacities. The green hydrogen industry has started gaining traction with an increasing number of project Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) taken over the recent months.\nOur sales pipeline and contract backlog have never been healthier, and we now have a product portfolio tailored to our customers' needs. This has been evidenced in us winning theShell REFHYNE II 100MW project, two contracts for a total of four NEPTUNE V units, and a 50MW and a 10MW FEED contract; all profitable orders. Operationally, we are in the best condition the company has ever been in. Tangible evidence of this is our continuously improved factory acceptance test (FAT) first-time-pass rate for stacks, which now stands at 98%, up from below 50% just two years ago. We commissioned important reference plants for our customers, some of which were publicly inaugurated, such as the 24MW green hydrogen to green ammonia plant operated by Yara in Norway and the 4MW pilot plant at Lingen for RWE. All this is conducive to customer confidence, and, over time, these factors support converting our growth into profitability and cash generation. Today, I am even more optimistic about our future than when I joined the company two years ago.\"\nDennis Schulz, Amy Grey, Andy Allen and Dr Simon Bourne will present to analysts and investors at 9:00 a.m. GMT.\nThe presentation will be via the Investor Meet Company platform.

Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms/Mx Market is being irrational - CWR up almost 50% in 2 weeks on licensing with one manufacturer's plant not built yet (Weichai) and Doosan not really announced any more solid contracts to allow for revenue forecasting, so it is all on speculation of revenue in a few years time - not saying it isn't a good prospect and should see the same kind of returns as ITM but ITM has the pipeline there and the market is irrationally not pricing it properly, IMO.",

Sir Roger Bone, the incumbent Non-Executive Chair, will retire on the same date. J\u00fcrgen brings deep industrial expertise and a strong track record in the global hydrogen sector and the wider industrial gases industry. Up until May this year, J\u00fcrgen served as CEO of Linde Engineering and as a member of Linde PLC's Executive Leadership Team. Before that, he held various senior executive positions within Linde's Gases and Forklift division in Germany, the US and the Czech Republic. His extensive experience in large-scale engineering and the international markets aligns strongly with ITM's strategy to further scale and commercialise its technology. J\u00fcrgen served as Linde's nominated Board representative from November 2019 until January 2025 and his new term as Non-Executive Chair will take into account his prior appointment tenure at ITM. Sir Roger Bone has served as Non-Executive Chair since 2019 and as Non-Executive Director since 2014. During Sir Roger's chairmanship, ITM transitioned from a development-stage company to an established commercial business and market leader in electrolysers, and strengthened its governance and leadership team. Dennis Schulz, CEO, commented, \"J\u00fcrgen's appointment as Chair signals our ambition. He brings sharp strategic instinct and industry depth. His experience and customer contacts will be invaluable as we execute the next phase of our growth strategy. \"On behalf of the Board and the wider ITM team, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his stewardship, wise counsel, and unwavering support over the past years. His commitment and leadership helped guide the Company through a crucial phase of transformation.\" J\u00fcrgen Nowicki said: \"I am deeply honoured to take on the role of Chair at ITM during this pivotal moment in the Company's growth. As we continue to lead the charge in green hydrogen innovation, I firmly believe that this technology will play a central role in the global energy transition. ITM stands at the forefront of this transformation, uniquely positioned with its cutting-edge technology and robust manufacturing capabilities. \"Having had the privilege of working with Dennis previously, I'm excited to renew our partnership. Together, we will accelerate ITM's growth and enhance long-term value. \"Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his outstanding leadership, commitment, and contributions to ITM. It has truly been an honour working alongside him, and I look forward to building on the strong legacy he leaves.\"",

Another former Linde man at the top of the tree along with others - increasing (imho) the ultimate mid to long term plan for them to buy/takeover us over, or at least enter into some form of a 'partnership agreement' - which may be excellent news - if at a significant times current SP - but not at a 'cut-price' backroom deal... Now at what price, you'd consider that to be will differ from SH to SH - as I'm looking at a min of 3-5 years myself I for one will be disappointed at any thing less than \u00a32.50 at this point... As always please do your own research - hold your own opinions and buy, sell or hold to your own timelines/circumstances as it's your investment not mine or anyone else's! Have a Happy Friday Jim",

As a long term investor I remain confident, and comfortable with my holding, in that it will either bring profit or a long term income.

That said we are at a pivotal moment where we need a little more information... We need to hear how the myriad announcements about capacity reservations, technology wins, FEED participations  & Chronos development are progressing toward contracts and ultimately financial results. Leadership used to rail against our competitors and their announcements about pre-FID projects.  Without, a bit more transparency about progress on the above we run the perception risk of doing the same...announcements that come to nothing.  Perhaps this is one reason our share price has not progressed? The transparency is easily accomplished via a simple dashboard showing our ever changing pipeline through our stage gates from prospect thru FEED, FID, Construction, Commissioning to Operations & Revenue recognition.  This dashboard could be persistently maintained (monthly, quarterly)  & presented on our website.  It would be anonymized by merely representing MW by business line, product & geography.  This along with our uniquely published pricing would enable all stakeholders (present & future) to estimate (forecast) revenue ranges. Of course, we also what to hear about product performance in the field, status of high profile projects; RWE Lingen, Linde Leuna, Shell Refhyne, Guttroff, ... and manufacturing productivity / capacity...merely updates of all previous presentations.  We love the simplicity, candor and integrity we all the updates under the current leadership. We are doing a wonderful job differentiating ourselves from all other players in our industry.  Let's take this one little step and further differentiate ourselves so that we optimize shareholder value...where the latter is based on both real (revenue, NI, free cash) and perceived value (expectations of future revenue, NI, free cash).",

For a company to be optimally valued, investors need to feel confident in those cash flow streams.  Confidence rises as transparency increases.  Lack of transparency results in greater discounting...lower valuations. Leadership has set expectations with a steady stream of announcements; technology wins, capacity reservations, FEED study participation, strategic partnerships and new business launches.   We are merely asking for transparency into progress of these initiatives.  That is not an entitlement, it is a reasonable expectation useful for optimizing shareholder valuation...one that literally requires 1 hour / month to maintain. Competitive concerns are a red-herring.  All data can be anonymized and should reflect only those initiatives that we, ourselves, have placed in public view (via Regulatory News). Behavioral Finance 201 To repeat, we are optimistic about the industry and our company's position in it.  We are very pleased with the strategy and our relentless focus on execution.  We are also very pleased with the candor & consistency with which the company shares with all stakeholders...albeit with this one shortfall. Unfortunately, we believe that our shares are undervalued and are left hoping that Leadership will take advantage of 'all' tools to optimize valuation; real execution + managed expecttations",

Hedge funds have placed a \u00a3100bn bet on gilts that the Bank of England believes has left Britain dangerously exposed to a bond market meltdown. Andrew Bailey will face questions from MPs this week after Threadneedle Street expressed alarm over trades that allow hedge funds to borrow huge amounts of cash from banks using gilts as collateral. The Governor of the Bank of England has warned that volatility in the bond market is unavoidable. Officials are now concerned that trading by hedge funds could pose risks to the financial system. They face less regulatory scrutiny than banks but control a growing share of global money. Hedge funds have opposed proposals by regulators to limit risk-taking on gilts",

I still believe there was some involvement from the authorities in the end to put a stop to it, but we will never know. They now know what they are up against, and with positive news continuing just do not know how to cash in their chips without creating a storm.  With daily volume sitting around 1.2m shares traded in Jan, 24,000,000+ is a lot of shares to buy. For the record they are not having any of mine, I don't care when they do it, I am in for the long term but would like to see the share price reflect the progress which the company is making, not some value with 24m additional shares being on the table and horse traded for short term profit. My opinion of course DYOR and all of that !!",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

The path to profitability is clear for ITM and we are progressing nicely along this. Plug has more FIDs under its belt and electrolyser sales growing faster but high debt and less good cost control make it significantly riskier. Electrolysers sales is plugs fastest growing division. Given MCAP ITM is the better bet (plug market cap is 5xITM). In addition plug have a load of debt while ITM have sufficient cash in hand to get through to profitability. Steady execution apparent under DS. Steady nerves needed. Acceleration of FIDs towards stated hydrogen national goals will propel ITM back to 2021 levels.",

His expertise in large-scale industrial gases and global engineering suggests ITM is prepping for massive commercial scaling. \u2022 Sir Warren East (NED): The former CEO of Rolls-Royce and ARM joined the board late last year, bringing deep experience in high-stakes engineering and technology commercialization. \u2022 **John Howarth (NED): A manufacturing and renewables expert who now chairs the Remuneration Committee, highlighting a focus on disciplined financial governance. Job Opportunities & Recruitment Uptick There is a visible uptick in \"operational excellence\" and \"delivery\" roles, which differs from the R&D-heavy hiring of previous years. Recent and current openings include: \u2022 **HSE Manager (Sheffield): Focused on leading safety agendas across fast-paced manufacturing sites. \u2022 Logistics & Supply Chain Coordinators: Recent listings for Logistics Coordinators in Sheffield emphasize the \"movement of goods\" and \"import/export compliance,\" indicating that production volumes are increasing. \u2022 2026 Apprenticeship Intake: ITM has confirmed a new intake for 2026 to \"meet future skills gaps,\" suggesting they are once again looking at long-term headcount growth rather than just cost-cutting. Does this suggest an improving business outlook? Yes, but with a focus on \"Quality over Quantity.\" Unlike the speculative hiring of the 2021 hydrogen bubble, the current recruitment strategy is disciplined. Several factors support a positive outlook: \u2022 Record Revenue: ITM reported record H1 2026 revenue of \u00a318 million (up significantly from previous years) and narrowed its EBITDA losses. \u2022 Europe Momentum: While the US market is uncertain, ITM is seeing an \"acceleration\" in Germany and the UK. Hiring for logistics and site management supports this regional growth. \u2022 Product Maturity: The launch of the ALPHA 50 (50 MW systems) and the CHRONOS stack platform requires a shift toward manufacturing and deployment talent rather than just laboratory researchers.",

          "content": "Hydropulse is a central pillar of ITM Power\u2019s 2026 growth strategy. While ITM Power itself focuses on manufacturing electrolysers, Hydropulse (launched in mid-2025) is its \"Hydrogen-as-a-Service\" arm. Its hiring and strategic shifts are even more aggressive than the parent company's, as it moves from a startup concept into an active infrastructure developer. Recent Hydropulse Strategies Hydropulse\u2019s primary goal is to solve the \"bankability\" issue for green hydrogen. They build, own, and operate (BOO) plants on-site for industrial customers, removing the need for customers to pay huge upfront costs (Zero CAPEX). \u2022 Strategic Partnership with ABO Energy (Jan 2026): This is a massive recent development. They\u2019ve teamed up with ABO Energy to expand into Spain and Finland, where low power prices make green hydrogen more profitable. This allows Hydropulse to scale much faster by leveraging ABO\u2019s existing renewable energy projects. \u2022 Focus on Small-to-Mid Scale: While ITM Power builds massive 100MW+ stacks for utilities, Hydropulse targets industrial \"off-takers\" (steel, chemicals, food processing) that need smaller, decentralized units. \u2022 Insulation from Energy Risk: A key part of their strategy is that they don't buy the power themselves; the customer provides the electricity. This protects Hydropulse (and your investment outlook) from volatile energy markets. Hiring & Job Opportunities Unlike ITM Power\u2019s manufacturing-heavy recruitment, Hydropulse is hiring for commercial and operational \"front-end\" roles. \u2022 Berlin Expansion: Hydropulse is headquartered in Berlin and is actively recruiting for Commercial Managers and Senior Business Development Managers. \u2022 Operational Control: They are building a 24/7 Remote Operations Centre in Germany to monitor their decentralized plants. This suggests upcoming roles for specialized systems engineers and data analysts. \u2022 Sales Pipeline: The hiring for Business Development in Germany and the Nordics indicates that the \"sales pipeline\" mentioned in the H1 2026 report is being actively converted into contracts. Does this suggest an improving outlook? In short: Yes. Hydropulse represents the \"recurring revenue\" model that ITM Power has lacked in the past.",

Available evidence from early-stage projects, and OEM engagement indicates that power derating of between 10 \u2013 20% could be required for initial deployments. These turbines offer flexible operation on hydrogen-natural gas blends and the capacity to operate on natural gas in the event of hydrogen fuel supply disruption. \u2022 Turbines typically require natural gas for start-up, necessitating dual fuel infrastructure. \u2022 Reciprocating engines, commercially available today for 100% hydrogen, typically carry a CAPEX uplift of 10\u201320% compared to natural gas equivalents but face significant power reductions when operating on blends, limiting their operational capacity in the event of hydrogen fuel supply disruption. \u2022 Industrial combined heat and power (CHP) systems are typically developed at refineries or sites with local steam demand, presenting viable local decarbonisation opportunities, dependent on steam offtake, but with limited potential for extensive rollout. \u2022 Fuel cells, despite high efficiency, face high CAPEX versus competing technologies. Future deployment hinges on capital cost reductions and high load factor applications to leverage efficiency benefits. \u2022 Effective deployment of all grid-scale hydrogen to power technologies depends heavily on hydrogen storage, particularly geographically limited salt caverns, with storage needs rising significantly at high hydrogen blends, and the potential for dual-fuel flexibility to optimise storage use and system reliability. \u2022 Coordinated policy and regulatory frameworks across hydrogen production, storage, and power generation are essential to manage risks and enable investment.",

Additionally, a new proposal for a major hydrogen production plant with dispensing infrastructure is undergoing public consultation for a site in East Calder, signalling significant local investment and development in clean energy. Key Developments: Selms Muir Project (Livingston Area): A joint venture by Hygen and European Energy, this plant will use a 20MW electrolyser to produce low-carbon hydrogen. It's designed to power local buses, heavy vehicles, and construction equipment, reducing carbon emissions. The project is shortlisted for UK government funding (HAR2) and aims to be operational within two years of final investment, says this Daily Record article. East Calder Hydrogen Facility: A new, major hydrogen production plant is proposed for land off Morton Road. Public consultations for this development, including its associated infrastructure, began in January 2026, with events held at the East Calder Partnership Centre. Why It Matters: Net Zero Targets: These projects align with both Scottish and UK goals for renewable energy and decarbonisation. Local Economy: They promise investment, skilled jobs, and cleaner energy solutions for West Lothian. Hard-to-Abate Sectors: Hydrogen production here targets heavy transport and industry, areas difficult to electrify.",

Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms/Mx Market is being irrational - CWR up almost 50% in 2 weeks on licensing with one manufacturer's plant not built yet (Weichai) and Doosan not really announced any more solid contracts to allow for revenue forecasting, so it is all on speculation of revenue in a few years time - not saying it isn't a good prospect and should see the same kind of returns as ITM but ITM has the pipeline there and the market is irrationally not pricing it properly, IMO.",

Sir Roger Bone, the incumbent Non-Executive Chair, will retire on the same date. J\u00fcrgen brings deep industrial expertise and a strong track record in the global hydrogen sector and the wider industrial gases industry. Up until May this year, J\u00fcrgen served as CEO of Linde Engineering and as a member of Linde PLC's Executive Leadership Team. Before that, he held various senior executive positions within Linde's Gases and Forklift division in Germany, the US and the Czech Republic. His extensive experience in large-scale engineering and the international markets aligns strongly with ITM's strategy to further scale and commercialise its technology. J\u00fcrgen served as Linde's nominated Board representative from November 2019 until January 2025 and his new term as Non-Executive Chair will take into account his prior appointment tenure at ITM. Sir Roger Bone has served as Non-Executive Chair since 2019 and as Non-Executive Director since 2014. During Sir Roger's chairmanship, ITM transitioned from a development-stage company to an established commercial business and market leader in electrolysers, and strengthened its governance and leadership team. Dennis Schulz, CEO, commented, \"J\u00fcrgen's appointment as Chair signals our ambition. He brings sharp strategic instinct and industry depth. His experience and customer contacts will be invaluable as we execute the next phase of our growth strategy. \"On behalf of the Board and the wider ITM team, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his stewardship, wise counsel, and unwavering support over the past years. His commitment and leadership helped guide the Company through a crucial phase of transformation.\" J\u00fcrgen Nowicki said: \"I am deeply honoured to take on the role of Chair at ITM during this pivotal moment in the Company's growth. As we continue to lead the charge in green hydrogen innovation, I firmly believe that this technology will play a central role in the global energy transition. ITM stands at the forefront of this transformation, uniquely positioned with its cutting-edge technology and robust manufacturing capabilities. \"Having had the privilege of working with Dennis previously, I'm excited to renew our partnership. Together, we will accelerate ITM's growth and enhance long-term value. \"Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his outstanding leadership, commitment, and contributions to ITM. It has truly been an honour working alongside him, and I look forward to building on the strong legacy he leaves.\"",

That said we are at a pivotal moment where we need a little more information... We need to hear how the myriad announcements about capacity reservations, technology wins, FEED participations  & Chronos development are progressing toward contracts and ultimately financial results. Leadership used to rail against our competitors and their announcements about pre-FID projects.  Without, a bit more transparency about progress on the above we run the perception risk of doing the same...announcements that come to nothing.  Perhaps this is one reason our share price has not progressed? The transparency is easily accomplished via a simple dashboard showing our ever changing pipeline through our stage gates from prospect thru FEED, FID, Construction, Commissioning to Operations & Revenue recognition.  This dashboard could be persistently maintained (monthly, quarterly)  & presented on our website.  It would be anonymized by merely representing MW by business line, product & geography.  This along with our uniquely published pricing would enable all stakeholders (present & future) to estimate (forecast) revenue ranges. Of course, we also what to hear about product performance in the field, status of high profile projects; RWE Lingen, Linde Leuna, Shell Refhyne, Guttroff, ... and manufacturing productivity / capacity...merely updates of all previous presentations.  We love the simplicity, candor and integrity we all the updates under the current leadership. We are doing a wonderful job differentiating ourselves from all other players in our industry.  Let's take this one little step and further differentiate ourselves so that we optimize shareholder value...where the latter is based on both real (revenue, NI, free cash) and perceived value (expectations of future revenue, NI, free cash).",

For a company to be optimally valued, investors need to feel confident in those cash flow streams.  Confidence rises as transparency increases.  Lack of transparency results in greater discounting...lower valuations. Leadership has set expectations with a steady stream of announcements; technology wins, capacity reservations, FEED study participation, strategic partnerships and new business launches.   We are merely asking for transparency into progress of these initiatives.  That is not an entitlement, it is a reasonable expectation useful for optimizing shareholder valuation...one that literally requires 1 hour / month to maintain. Competitive concerns are a red-herring.  All data can be anonymized and should reflect only those initiatives that we, ourselves, have placed in public view (via Regulatory News). Behavioral Finance 201 To repeat, we are optimistic about the industry and our company's position in it.  We are very pleased with the strategy and our relentless focus on execution.  We are also very pleased with the candor & consistency with which the company shares with all stakeholders...albeit with this one shortfall. Unfortunately, we believe that our shares are undervalued and are left hoping that Leadership will take advantage of 'all' tools to optimize valuation; real execution + managed expecttations",

Hedge funds have placed a \u00a3100bn bet on gilts that the Bank of England believes has left Britain dangerously exposed to a bond market meltdown. Andrew Bailey will face questions from MPs this week after Threadneedle Street expressed alarm over trades that allow hedge funds to borrow huge amounts of cash from banks using gilts as collateral. The Governor of the Bank of England has warned that volatility in the bond market is unavoidable. Officials are now concerned that trading by hedge funds could pose risks to the financial system. They face less regulatory scrutiny than banks but control a growing share of global money. Hedge funds have opposed proposals by regulators to limit risk-taking on gilts",

Notwithstanding the entire collapse of the Western world - which up until a few days ago seemed a long way off - I have looked at the overall position of the Company - the contracts, agreements, JV's etc. coming down the line and therefore I am looking for a conservative (at least to some others)  yet positive range of: 117p - 138p by end of the year. As always, please make your own mind up - it's your investment not mine - buy, sell or hold to your own timeline/circumstances. A Happy, Healthy  New Year to one and all Jim",

The path to profitability is clear for ITM and we are progressing nicely along this. Plug has more FIDs under its belt and electrolyser sales growing faster but high debt and less good cost control make it significantly riskier. Electrolysers sales is plugs fastest growing division. Given MCAP ITM is the better bet (plug market cap is 5xITM). In addition plug have a load of debt while ITM have sufficient cash in hand to get through to profitability. Steady execution apparent under DS. Steady nerves needed. Acceleration of FIDs towards stated hydrogen national goals will propel ITM back to 2021 levels.",

          "content": "ITM Power\u2019s recent hiring activity and executive reshuffling suggest a company moving from a painful \"turnaround\" phase into a high-growth \"execution\" phase. After slashing its headcount by one-third in 2024 to curb losses, the company is now back in the market for specialized roles that align with its 2026 goal of profitability. Recent Strategic Hires & Leadership Changes The most significant indicator of an improving outlook is the caliber of leadership ITM is attracting. The company has shifted from \"development-mode\" directors to \"heavy-industry\" veterans: \u2022 J\u00fcrgen Nowicki (Incoming Chair, effective Jan 15, 2026): The appointment of the former CEO of Linde Engineering is a major signal. His expertise in large-scale industrial gases and global engineering suggests ITM is prepping for massive commercial scaling. \u2022 Sir Warren East (NED): The former CEO of Rolls-Royce and ARM joined the board late last year, bringing deep experience in high-stakes engineering and technology commercialization. \u2022 **John Howarth (NED): A manufacturing and renewables expert who now chairs the Remuneration Committee, highlighting a focus on disciplined financial governance. Job Opportunities & Recruitment Uptick There is a visible uptick in \"operational excellence\" and \"delivery\" roles, which differs from the R&D-heavy hiring of previous years. Recent and current openings include: \u2022 **HSE Manager (Sheffield): Focused on leading safety agendas across fast-paced manufacturing sites. \u2022 Logistics & Supply Chain Coordinators: Recent listings for Logistics Coordinators in Sheffield emphasize the \"movement of goods\" and \"import/export compliance,\" indicating that production volumes are increasing. \u2022 2026 Apprenticeship Intake: ITM has confirmed a new intake for 2026 to \"meet future skills gaps,\" suggesting they are once again looking at long-term headcount growth rather than just cost-cutting. Does this suggest an improving business outlook? Yes, but with a focus on \"Quality over Quantity.\" Unlike the speculative hiring of the 2021 hydrogen bubble, the current recruitment strategy is disciplined. Several factors support a positive outlook: \u2022 Record Revenue: ITM reported record H1 2026 revenue of \u00a318 million (up significantly from previous years) and narrowed its EBITDA losses. \u2022 Europe Momentum: While the US market is uncertain, ITM is seeing an \"acceleration\" in Germany and the UK. Hiring for logistics and site management supports this regional growth. \u2022 Product Maturity: The launch of the ALPHA 50 (50 MW systems) and the CHRONOS stack platform requires a shift toward manufacturing and deployment talent rather than just laboratory researchers.",

          "content": "Hydropulse is a central pillar of ITM Power\u2019s 2026 growth strategy. While ITM Power itself focuses on manufacturing electrolysers, Hydropulse (launched in mid-2025) is its \"Hydrogen-as-a-Service\" arm. Its hiring and strategic shifts are even more aggressive than the parent company's, as it moves from a startup concept into an active infrastructure developer. Recent Hydropulse Strategies Hydropulse\u2019s primary goal is to solve the \"bankability\" issue for green hydrogen. They build, own, and operate (BOO) plants on-site for industrial customers, removing the need for customers to pay huge upfront costs (Zero CAPEX). \u2022 Strategic Partnership with ABO Energy (Jan 2026): This is a massive recent development. They\u2019ve teamed up with ABO Energy to expand into Spain and Finland, where low power prices make green hydrogen more profitable. This allows Hydropulse to scale much faster by leveraging ABO\u2019s existing renewable energy projects. \u2022 Focus on Small-to-Mid Scale: While ITM Power builds massive 100MW+ stacks for utilities, Hydropulse targets industrial \"off-takers\" (steel, chemicals, food processing) that need smaller, decentralized units. \u2022 Insulation from Energy Risk: A key part of their strategy is that they don't buy the power themselves; the customer provides the electricity. This protects Hydropulse (and your investment outlook) from volatile energy markets. Hiring & Job Opportunities Unlike ITM Power\u2019s manufacturing-heavy recruitment, Hydropulse is hiring for commercial and operational \"front-end\" roles. \u2022 Berlin Expansion: Hydropulse is headquartered in Berlin and is actively recruiting for Commercial Managers and Senior Business Development Managers. \u2022 Operational Control: They are building a 24/7 Remote Operations Centre in Germany to monitor their decentralized plants. This suggests upcoming roles for specialized systems engineers and data analysts. \u2022 Sales Pipeline: The hiring for Business Development in Germany and the Nordics indicates that the \"sales pipeline\" mentioned in the H1 2026 report is being actively converted into contracts. Does this suggest an improving outlook? In short: Yes. Hydropulse represents the \"recurring revenue\" model that ITM Power has lacked in the past.",

Available evidence from early-stage projects, and OEM engagement indicates that power derating of between 10 \u2013 20% could be required for initial deployments. These turbines offer flexible operation on hydrogen-natural gas blends and the capacity to operate on natural gas in the event of hydrogen fuel supply disruption. \u2022 Turbines typically require natural gas for start-up, necessitating dual fuel infrastructure. \u2022 Reciprocating engines, commercially available today for 100% hydrogen, typically carry a CAPEX uplift of 10\u201320% compared to natural gas equivalents but face significant power reductions when operating on blends, limiting their operational capacity in the event of hydrogen fuel supply disruption. \u2022 Industrial combined heat and power (CHP) systems are typically developed at refineries or sites with local steam demand, presenting viable local decarbonisation opportunities, dependent on steam offtake, but with limited potential for extensive rollout. \u2022 Fuel cells, despite high efficiency, face high CAPEX versus competing technologies. Future deployment hinges on capital cost reductions and high load factor applications to leverage efficiency benefits. \u2022 Effective deployment of all grid-scale hydrogen to power technologies depends heavily on hydrogen storage, particularly geographically limited salt caverns, with storage needs rising significantly at high hydrogen blends, and the potential for dual-fuel flexibility to optimise storage use and system reliability. \u2022 Coordinated policy and regulatory frameworks across hydrogen production, storage, and power generation are essential to manage risks and enable investment.",

On the flip side if Reform get elected next they are keen on putting an end to Green focused projects, political debate aside I think they are very shortsighted / dim to not prioritise energy security with their general mindset. North Sea oil and gas exists already. Adding back up / green energy just strengthens the UKs position.. maybe they will see some sense. The other potential issue we face is increased military spending in UK & Europe which might impact more \u201cwholesome \u201c spending, though the German military have expressed interest in utilising Hydrogen for efficiency.

Additionally, a new proposal for a major hydrogen production plant with dispensing infrastructure is undergoing public consultation for a site in East Calder, signalling significant local investment and development in clean energy. Key Developments: Selms Muir Project (Livingston Area): A joint venture by Hygen and European Energy, this plant will use a 20MW electrolyser to produce low-carbon hydrogen. It's designed to power local buses, heavy vehicles, and construction equipment, reducing carbon emissions. The project is shortlisted for UK government funding (HAR2) and aims to be operational within two years of final investment, says this Daily Record article. East Calder Hydrogen Facility: A new, major hydrogen production plant is proposed for land off Morton Road. Public consultations for this development, including its associated infrastructure, began in January 2026, with events held at the East Calder Partnership Centre. Why It Matters: Net Zero Targets: These projects align with both Scottish and UK goals for renewable energy and decarbonisation. Local Economy: They promise investment, skilled jobs, and cleaner energy solutions for West Lothian. Hard-to-Abate Sectors: Hydrogen production here targets heavy transport and industry, areas difficult to electrify.",

Sir Roger Bone, the incumbent Non-Executive Chair, will retire on the same date. J\u00fcrgen brings deep industrial expertise and a strong track record in the global hydrogen sector and the wider industrial gases industry. Up until May this year, J\u00fcrgen served as CEO of Linde Engineering and as a member of Linde PLC's Executive Leadership Team. Before that, he held various senior executive positions within Linde's Gases and Forklift division in Germany, the US and the Czech Republic. His extensive experience in large-scale engineering and the international markets aligns strongly with ITM's strategy to further scale and commercialise its technology. J\u00fcrgen served as Linde's nominated Board representative from November 2019 until January 2025 and his new term as Non-Executive Chair will take into account his prior appointment tenure at ITM. Sir Roger Bone has served as Non-Executive Chair since 2019 and as Non-Executive Director since 2014. During Sir Roger's chairmanship, ITM transitioned from a development-stage company to an established commercial business and market leader in electrolysers, and strengthened its governance and leadership team. Dennis Schulz, CEO, commented, \"J\u00fcrgen's appointment as Chair signals our ambition. He brings sharp strategic instinct and industry depth. His experience and customer contacts will be invaluable as we execute the next phase of our growth strategy. \"On behalf of the Board and the wider ITM team, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his stewardship, wise counsel, and unwavering support over the past years. His commitment and leadership helped guide the Company through a crucial phase of transformation.\" J\u00fcrgen Nowicki said: \"I am deeply honoured to take on the role of Chair at ITM during this pivotal moment in the Company's growth. As we continue to lead the charge in green hydrogen innovation, I firmly believe that this technology will play a central role in the global energy transition. ITM stands at the forefront of this transformation, uniquely positioned with its cutting-edge technology and robust manufacturing capabilities. \"Having had the privilege of working with Dennis previously, I'm excited to renew our partnership. Together, we will accelerate ITM's growth and enhance long-term value. \"Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his outstanding leadership, commitment, and contributions to ITM. It has truly been an honour working alongside him, and I look forward to building on the strong legacy he leaves.\"",

Now at what price, you'd consider that to be will differ from SH to SH - as I'm looking at a min of 3-5 years myself I for one will be disappointed at any thing less than \u00a32.50 at this point...

As a long term investor I remain confident, and comfortable with my holding, in that it will either bring profit or a long term income.

That said we are at a pivotal moment where we need a little more information... We need to hear how the myriad announcements about capacity reservations, technology wins, FEED participations  & Chronos development are progressing toward contracts and ultimately financial results. Leadership used to rail against our competitors and their announcements about pre-FID projects.  Without, a bit more transparency about progress on the above we run the perception risk of doing the same...announcements that come to nothing.  Perhaps this is one reason our share price has not progressed? The transparency is easily accomplished via a simple dashboard showing our ever changing pipeline through our stage gates from prospect thru FEED, FID, Construction, Commissioning to Operations & Revenue recognition.  This dashboard could be persistently maintained (monthly, quarterly)  & presented on our website.  It would be anonymized by merely representing MW by business line, product & geography.  This along with our uniquely published pricing would enable all stakeholders (present & future) to estimate (forecast) revenue ranges. Of course, we also what to hear about product performance in the field, status of high profile projects; RWE Lingen, Linde Leuna, Shell Refhyne, Guttroff, ... and manufacturing productivity / capacity...merely updates of all previous presentations.  We love the simplicity, candor and integrity we all the updates under the current leadership. We are doing a wonderful job differentiating ourselves from all other players in our industry.  Let's take this one little step and further differentiate ourselves so that we optimize shareholder value...where the latter is based on both real (revenue, NI, free cash) and perceived value (expectations of future revenue, NI, free cash).",

The Governor of the Bank of England has warned that volatility in the bond market is unavoidable. Officials are now concerned that trading by hedge funds could pose risks to the financial system.

While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

          "content": "As of 2026, RES has one of the largest onshore wind pipelines in the UK, with a heavy concentration in Scotland to support the Scottish Government\u2019s target of 20GW by 2030. Their strategy is increasingly to co-locate or pipe this energy directly to industrial green hydrogen hubs through the HYRO joint venture. 1. Onshore Wind Farms in Planning (Scotland focus) RES is currently moving several large-scale projects through the planning system. Because of the size of these turbines, most are now handled directly by the Scottish Government's Energy Consents Unit (ECU) rather than local councils. 2. Where Green Hydrogen Facilities May Be Sited Through the HYRO partnership with Octopus, RES is targeting industrial clusters where they can replace gas usage directly. While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

With daily volume sitting around 1.2m shares traded in Jan, 24,000,000+ is a lot of shares to buy. For the record they are not having any of mine, I don't care when they do it, I am in for the long term but would like to see the share price reflect the progress which the company is making, not some value with 24m additional shares being on the table and horse traded for short term profit.

The calculation methodology is set out in\nNote 3.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM, said:\n\"We have yet again delivered our strongest six-month revenue performance to date while maintaining strict cash and operational discipline.\nIn the first half of the financial year, commercial activity has progressed well with the award of multiple equipment supply contracts, several engineering contracts, a significant capacity reservation from RWE, an important repeat customer, and beyond that our selection as electrolyser provider for several other upcoming projects. This progress underpins customer confidence and market traction in an environment which had to fight with known headwinds.\nThe Hydropulse business was well received at its launch and has since progressed several project discussions, supporting ITM's move towards recurring profitable revenue. Furthermore, Hydropulse is lining itself up to play a role in various government-backed funding programmes including HAR3 in the UK and various schemes in Germany.\nQ4 saw the launch of our new product, ALPHA 50, the world's most competitive full-scope and highly efficient green hydrogen plant solution, which has generated strong interest among large-scale industrial customers.\nWhile FID timing, of course, remains customer-led, we are closely engaged with our customers across many projects, and we expect FID momentum to continue accelerating through 2026 and beyond.\nCHRONOS, our next-generation stack platform, has continued to progress through development and validation to plan. We are confident that, once launched, CHRONOS will be a true gamechanger for the electrolyser industry.\nProject progress has been solid. To pick a few: The world's most advanced and largest PEM electrolyser plant, Lingen 1, for RWE has seen all 100 MW of TRIDENT stacks and skids installed and pressure-tested on time. For the second 100 MW, Lingen 2, all TRIDENT skids and already 40% of the stacks have been installed. The Leuna project with Linde is also nearing completion.\nThere is no doubt that green hydrogen will play an essential role in the decarbonisation of global industries and energy systems. Despite wider macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, clean hydrogen continues to progress at pace, with committed investments having risen elevenfold from $10bn to $110bn between 2020 and 2025\n[1]\n. Growth remains strongly supported by policy, increasing industrial demand, and ongoing sector consolidation - strengthening the foundations for a more resilient and commercially viable market.\"\nDennis Schulz, Amy Grey, and Simon Bourne will present to analysts and investors at 9:00 a.m. GMT.\nThe presentation will be via the Investor Meet Company platform.

          "content": "From AI Quote: Goldman Sachs has several notable connections to Qube Research & Technologies (QRT), a rapidly growing London-based quantitative hedge fund that manages over $30 billion. These links primarily involve the poaching of senior talent for expansion and the use of similar, high-tech, multi-manager structures. Key Connections and Personnel Naveen Arora (US Expansion): Qube hired Naveen Arora, the former co-head of US power trading at Goldman Sachs, to lead the buildout of its first US office in Houston in 2025. This move is central to Qube's expansion into physical commodity trading in the US. Tom Gorman (COO role): Tom Gorman, previously an executive director and head of hedge fund consulting at Goldman Sachs, joined Qube as a COO in their Hong Kong office. Talent Flow: Qube has actively recruited from top-tier firms, including Goldman Sachs, as it expanded to over 1,400 employees and increased its assets under management. Systematic/Quant Focus: Both firms are deeply involved in quantitative strategies. Qube is noted as a \"quant giant\" that has grown in power, similar to other major players where Goldman often acts as a prime broker or competitor. Industry Trends: Goldman Sachs research highlighted that Qube is among the prominent multi-manager (\"pod shop\") funds experiencing record growth, and Goldman's analysis of the industry often features the hiring trends and structural growth of firms like Qube. Qube was originally spun out of Credit Suisse in 2018, but has since emerged as a major independent player by hiring extensively from investment banks like Goldman Sachs.",

The problem for ITM is rhat the bright future is always a few years away and I see no clear end to that scenario. The company may well become a big playes in the energy industry but progress seems to be painfully slow and yesterday's interim report does not provide any great incentive to buy the shares. Personally I plan to continue to hold but I may well be dead by the time the shares take off. I hope I am wrong about that.",

There should be so so (SO!) many positive announcements around the corner and each one will give a tick up with the end result a major upwards trajectory. I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about today\u2019s drop. It was late on after the USA opened , their tech stocks took an early hammering but subsequently recovered by Close. I\u2019m hoping for a part reversal tomorrow. Personally I may add more at these prices  , you have to make your own mind up but as several others have said\u2026. just a little more patience maybe?

Property is the safest bet probably but once that's covered and the kids have flown the nest you can speculate a bit. ITM would be near the top of the risk pyramid but has a lot of reward potential long term. It may be gradual or it may suddenly take off - that is the dilemma if you are unsure about holding or buying. For me it is a strong hold/buy.",

At some point we all surly have to evaluate where are money is best put? I\u2019m personally going to set a deadline of end of Feb. If the SP is still loitering around 62p come end of February I think I\u2019m going to take half out and invest in one of the AI hydro company\u2019s as I\u2019m losing patience and can\u2019t wait forever whilst other company\u2019s around  are smashing it. Just to add One of the main reasons i liked this company was the high risk / high reward potential, but now it doesn\u2019t feel high risk anymore, feels a safe bet that will prob climb but likely at a much slower rate, I feel I can have the same gains in a stock in a safer market other than green energy?

          "content": "As of 2026, RES has one of the largest onshore wind pipelines in the UK, with a heavy concentration in Scotland to support the Scottish Government\u2019s target of 20GW by 2030. Their strategy is increasingly to co-locate or pipe this energy directly to industrial green hydrogen hubs through the HYRO joint venture. 1. Onshore Wind Farms in Planning (Scotland focus) RES is currently moving several large-scale projects through the planning system. Because of the size of these turbines, most are now handled directly by the Scottish Government's Energy Consents Unit (ECU) rather than local councils. 2. Where Green Hydrogen Facilities May Be Sited Through the HYRO partnership with Octopus, RES is targeting industrial clusters where they can replace gas usage directly. While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

For the record they are not having any of mine, I don't care when they do it, I am in for the long term but would like to see the share price reflect the progress which the company is making, not some value with 24m additional shares being on the table and horse traded for short term profit.

The US market is effectively dead. And now Plug in (more) trouble. Again this only means possibility of more market share for ITM Dennis has stated many Electrolyser businesses will fall away, and only the viable ones will be left standing\u2026. Surely the last couple of days just prove that point. Sentiment in Europe (and most of the world) only seems to be moving in the right direction for Hydrogen. As Dennis said the US is not a key market for ITM in the immediate or near future. Despite the share price performance this week it\u2019s all looking very positive.

The funding was approved under the June 2025 Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF), which allows for continued support until the end of 2030. Eligible investments under CISAF include electrolysers, fuel cells, storage technologies, compressors, ammonia crackers, pipelines, and renewable energy infrastructure across wind, solar, and hydro. The commission said the scheme can offer support for decarbonising industrial processes \u201cthrough electrification, energy efficiency and the switch to the use of renewable and electricity-based hydrogen\u201d. The production and recycling of related critical raw materials will also be covered. Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, stressed the importance of the funding for reaching Clean Industrial Deal goals, saying it would also keep \u201cpotential competition distortions\u201d to a minimum. This comes as Germany\u2019s backing of hydrogen continues to outpace that of other EU states. Berlin and Brussels recently agreed on prospective plans to transition 12GW worth of power plants in the country to hydrogen by 2045, as well as a deal that will see Germany offer up to \u20ac200m ($232m) to Canada for importing green hydrogen. Germany also made a recent push in the mobility sector, investing \u20ac220m ($260m) into establishing a trial network of hydrogen refuelling stations, a move likely directed at EU renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) targets.",

The US engine manufacturer confirmed the move in its full-year 2025 results, reporting $458m in impairment and restructuring charges linked to its electrolyser business within the Accelera by Cummins unit. Cummins Inc. said conditions in electrolysers and broader hydrogen markets deteriorated rapidly during the second half of the year, driven by weak customer demand and uncertainty around government incentives.",

          "content": "I was wondering what Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) review would bring. See below from AI. The European Commission is expected to review Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) production rules by mid-2026, driven by industry calls to ease strict, costly, and complex compliance requirements. Current rules, including strict temporal and geographical correlation, are viewed as barriers to project development, with a 2026 revision likely to focus on relaxing these criteria to unlock investments and accelerate the green hydrogen market. The 2026 review is seen as a crucial turning point to transition from strict regulatory hurdles to more pragmatic, investment-friendly policies for the European hydrogen sector. Key aspects of the upcoming 2026 RFNBO review include: Potential Rule Changes: The EC is expected to review the \"additionality\" rule and temporal correlation requirements, which add an estimated \\(\\$1-2\\)/kg to green hydrogen production costs. Targeted Revisions: Proposals include relaxing strict, hourly correlation to monthly, and allowing grid electricity for electrolysis when prices are low. Shift in Strategy: Due to high costs, a shift toward non-RFNBO (low-carbon/blue) hydrogen is expected in 2026, with the EC allowing this in hydrogen bank auctions. Industry Pressure: Member states and industry players have lobbied for these changes to prevent stalling projects and to ensure that 2030 targets under RED III are achievable. Revised Targets: Some forecasts suggest that the 42% industrial RFNBO target for 2030 might be abandoned or significantly revised in 2026, with Germany's subsidy-based approach becoming a template.",

          "content": "From the manifesto: Europe cannot afford another missed opportunity. The choices made now will decide whether Europe leads the technologies that define the clean industrial era or becomes dependent on importing them from elsewhere. European electrolyser manufacturers have already shown what is possible. We have honoured our commitments, scaled annual production capacity and proven our ability to deliver world-class technology at industrial scale. Now, EU policymakers must match that ambition with policies that accelerate market demand, simplify regulation, and provide long-term investment certainty. Taken together, the measures described in this Manifesto would unlock immediate demand creating a functioning market for renewable and low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen. The market forces based on growing demand and competitive supply will lead to minimized costs, funding needs and risks for investors. Binding and monetisable RFNBO compliance, combined with an EU-wide book and claim \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d and revised rules in the RFNBO Delegated Act would ease RED III implementation across Member States, accelerate industrial and transport projects, and deliver earlier emissions cuts while laying the groundwork for the hydrogen backbone. By anchoring electrolyser manufacturing and critical component supply chains in Europe, these measures bolster resilience, reduce reliance on third country imports, and secure local high-skilled clean energy jobs. If we succeed, the benefit will be a competitive, sovereign, and resilient Europe that controls the technologies underpinning its clean-energy future, builds its own supply chains, and exports them to the world. It will mean millions of skilled jobs, and a new generation of European workers building the future rather than watching it arrive from abroad. Electrolysers can and must be the next success story for Europe: a technology driving Europe\u2019s resilience, competitiveness, and ambition. A technology Europe builds.",

Energy is also about security and resilience, not just price and emissions. Europe must build and protect its own industry and supply chains for critical clean-energy equipment. Today we lead the world in electrolysers - a technology essential for decarbonisation and a strategic infrastructure supporting grid stability and energy storage. This is why global competition is intense and why Europe\u2019s position is being challenged. The prize is an industry worth hundreds of billions, with strong export potential. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said, \u201cPeople with visions should go see a doctor.\u201d He may have been right - but the electrolyser industry can deliver tens of thousands of real jobs and long-term economic growth. Europe is built on common values and fair trade. From the Nordics to the EU and the UK, we are stronger together. Trade within Europe should be open and without barriers. New legislation, including the EU Industrial Accelerator Act, must reflect this reality and support European industry, while protecting supply chains from adverse outside interference. Europe has the technology and the manufacturing base. We now also have industrial-scale reference plants. The foundations are in place. It\u2019s time to spark industrial demand with clear policy signals and planning certainty.",

          "content": "Verbatim 'Amy Adams, CFO, ITM Power plc: Yes, of course, but before I do that, let me just take a little step through the changes that have happened in revenue recognition. So I\u2019m really pleased that we\u2019ve managed to review the recognition methods. As our product portfolio grows and develops, it\u2019s really important to take that step, step back and make sure what we\u2019re doing is appropriate, and it\u2019s allowed us to implement different ways of recognizing revenue to the one that we\u2019ve historically used. So the one that we\u2019ve historically used is completed contracts, so that\u2019s where we recognize revenue at specific points in a contract when performance obligations are met. They could be. That could be delivery or commissioning, but generally towards the end of a contract\u2019s life. We will still use that method for TRIDENTs, and we\u2019ll still use that method for our standard NEPTUNE products. The difference is that NEPTUNEs that contain a customer modification, POSEIDONs or ALPHAs, will be recognized over time as we produce the equipment, and that\u2019s really important, as we\u2019ll be able to see the revenue track through the profit and loss as we are actually manufacturing, and leads to a lot more predictable revenue going forward. If I could give you a real-life example, if you take the Uniper 120-MW Humber project in the U.K., so that\u2019s currently at the FEED process. So under the old recognition methods, the completed contracts method, we would recognize a small amount of revenue as we go through that FEED study, and then effectively you would see nothing else for two to three financial periods until we get towards the end of that contract and revenue would be recognized in one lump sum. If we transfer that to the new version of percentage completion, using ALPHA or POSEIDON, we\u2019d get exactly the same revenue for the FEED study, which would be recognized at the same point in time. But the difference being that at the point that we sign the contract up until delivery, we\u2019d be able to progressively recognize revenue. In that first financial year, you would see revenue happening for that project, and in the second, and then at delivery, until you get to the same point in time. It will allow us to be able to see progress through the factory in the P&L. Dennis Schulz, CEO, ITM Power plc: I think that\u2019s a massive change, if I may add. In the past, when we signed a large contract, 100 MW, more than 100 MW, for example, you would not see relevant revenue from that contract for minimum 2-3 years, right? Then everything would come at once. Under the new PoC, percentage of completion, method, from contract signature, you will see revenue coming in. That is important because it changes the financial profile of the company quite significantly. What it means is, if we sign a new large contract, during a year, now, for the first time, you will see an immediate impact on guidance for the year, and you will see an immediate impact on the financial numbers of th",

Because by implementing Chronos would increase productivity and reduce the cost of the hydrogen, in Hydropulse case this would mean better return on gas sales. And I assume cheaper costs for the client and cheaper manufacturing costs. Again I\u2019m certain the  company would not of mentioned Chronos in any shape or form if they thought it would negatively effect current negotiations but again, perhaps if you are reading Justin you could clear that question up?",

          "content": "From AI Quote: Goldman Sachs has several notable connections to Qube Research & Technologies (QRT), a rapidly growing London-based quantitative hedge fund that manages over $30 billion. These links primarily involve the poaching of senior talent for expansion and the use of similar, high-tech, multi-manager structures. Key Connections and Personnel Naveen Arora (US Expansion): Qube hired Naveen Arora, the former co-head of US power trading at Goldman Sachs, to lead the buildout of its first US office in Houston in 2025. This move is central to Qube's expansion into physical commodity trading in the US. Tom Gorman (COO role): Tom Gorman, previously an executive director and head of hedge fund consulting at Goldman Sachs, joined Qube as a COO in their Hong Kong office. Talent Flow: Qube has actively recruited from top-tier firms, including Goldman Sachs, as it expanded to over 1,400 employees and increased its assets under management. Systematic/Quant Focus: Both firms are deeply involved in quantitative strategies. Qube is noted as a \"quant giant\" that has grown in power, similar to other major players where Goldman often acts as a prime broker or competitor. Industry Trends: Goldman Sachs research highlighted that Qube is among the prominent multi-manager (\"pod shop\") funds experiencing record growth, and Goldman's analysis of the industry often features the hiring trends and structural growth of firms like Qube. Qube was originally spun out of Credit Suisse in 2018, but has since emerged as a major independent player by hiring extensively from investment banks like Goldman Sachs.",

Today\u2019s RNS was a Steady Eddie , some would say boring update , but it simply portrayed a fantastic stable base of cash , orders , products and growing potential that will be built on over the coming year. There should be so so (SO!) many positive announcements around the corner and each one will give a tick up with the end result a major upwards trajectory. I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about today\u2019s drop. It was late on after the USA opened , their tech stocks took an early hammering but subsequently recovered by Close. I\u2019m hoping for a part reversal tomorrow. Personally I may add more at these prices  , you have to make your own mind up but as several others have said\u2026. just a little more patience maybe?

Property is the safest bet probably but once that's covered and the kids have flown the nest you can speculate a bit. ITM would be near the top of the risk pyramid but has a lot of reward potential long term. It may be gradual or it may suddenly take off - that is the dilemma if you are unsure about holding or buying. For me it is a strong hold/buy.",

It\u2019s so undervalued and yet despite lots of contract wins the SP is refusing to shift in alignment with this fast growing  company. At some point we all surly have to evaluate where are money is best put? I\u2019m personally going to set a deadline of end of Feb. If the SP is still loitering around 62p come end of February I think I\u2019m going to take half out and invest in one of the AI hydro company\u2019s as I\u2019m losing patience and can\u2019t wait forever whilst other company\u2019s around  are smashing it. Just to add One of the main reasons i liked this company was the high risk / high reward potential, but now it doesn\u2019t feel high risk anymore, feels a safe bet that will prob climb but likely at a much slower rate, I feel I can have the same gains in a stock in a safer market other than green energy? Interested to know Anyone else  feels the same  or has any deadlines to get out?",

          "content": "As of 2026, RES has one of the largest onshore wind pipelines in the UK, with a heavy concentration in Scotland to support the Scottish Government\u2019s target of 20GW by 2030. Their strategy is increasingly to co-locate or pipe this energy directly to industrial green hydrogen hubs through the HYRO joint venture. 1. Onshore Wind Farms in Planning (Scotland focus) RES is currently moving several large-scale projects through the planning system. Because of the size of these turbines, most are now handled directly by the Scottish Government's Energy Consents Unit (ECU) rather than local councils. 2. Where Green Hydrogen Facilities May Be Sited Through the HYRO partnership with Octopus, RES is targeting industrial clusters where they can replace gas usage directly. While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

They now know what they are up against, and with positive news continuing just do not know how to cash in their chips without creating a storm.  With daily volume sitting around 1.2m shares traded in Jan, 24,000,000+ is a lot of shares to buy. For the record they are not having any of mine, I don't care when they do it, I am in for the long term but would like to see the share price reflect the progress which the company is making, not some value with 24m additional shares being on the table and horse traded for short term profit.

And seems to me the recent developments there are of benefit to ITM. \u201cThe decision is part of a broader, global restructuring of its Accelera by Cummins unit due to weak demand and ( this is the key part ) uncertainty surrounding government incentives\u201d. This seems to prove that with Trumps policy changes and the fact they can demand repayment of grants and funds from previous years as well as remove new ones. It\u2019s not good for USA companies, especially ones with extra costs of overseas shipping and operations. So for a smaller company like ITM this opens up a few opportunities. Firstly, they may be able to take agreed business and secondly it puts them further up the ladder of potential suppliers for new projects and those in negations in which Cummins was part of. This seems to be a very USA oriented issue with the governments current standing a key issue. It does not seems to reflect or negatively impact UK / EU or further still ( Australia, Asia etc ) And highlights the effectiveness of choosing the  Hydropulse model. Perhaps I\u2019m mistaken, but other key players taking a back seat can only be a positive for ITM. As long as Uk / EU demand is still there and strong. Hydropulse / Chronos hopefully with strengthen the investment case, but do hope we get some positive news soon on some of our many supposedly over due FIDs to back this theory up.",

Again this only means possibility of more market share for ITM Dennis has stated many Electrolyser businesses will fall away, and only the viable ones will be left standing\u2026. Surely the last couple of days just prove that point. Sentiment in Europe (and most of the world) only seems to be moving in the right direction for Hydrogen. As Dennis said the US is not a key market for ITM in the immediate or near future. Despite the share price performance this week it\u2019s all looking very positive.

The funding was approved under the June 2025 Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF), which allows for continued support until the end of 2030. Eligible investments under CISAF include electrolysers, fuel cells, storage technologies, compressors, ammonia crackers, pipelines, and renewable energy infrastructure across wind, solar, and hydro. The commission said the scheme can offer support for decarbonising industrial processes \u201cthrough electrification, energy efficiency and the switch to the use of renewable and electricity-based hydrogen\u201d. The production and recycling of related critical raw materials will also be covered. Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, stressed the importance of the funding for reaching Clean Industrial Deal goals, saying it would also keep \u201cpotential competition distortions\u201d to a minimum. This comes as Germany\u2019s backing of hydrogen continues to outpace that of other EU states. Berlin and Brussels recently agreed on prospective plans to transition 12GW worth of power plants in the country to hydrogen by 2045, as well as a deal that will see Germany offer up to \u20ac200m ($232m) to Canada for importing green hydrogen. Germany also made a recent push in the mobility sector, investing \u20ac220m ($260m) into establishing a trial network of hydrogen refuelling stations, a move likely directed at EU renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) targets.",

          "content": "I was wondering what Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) review would bring. See below from AI. The European Commission is expected to review Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) production rules by mid-2026, driven by industry calls to ease strict, costly, and complex compliance requirements. Current rules, including strict temporal and geographical correlation, are viewed as barriers to project development, with a 2026 revision likely to focus on relaxing these criteria to unlock investments and accelerate the green hydrogen market. The 2026 review is seen as a crucial turning point to transition from strict regulatory hurdles to more pragmatic, investment-friendly policies for the European hydrogen sector. Key aspects of the upcoming 2026 RFNBO review include: Potential Rule Changes: The EC is expected to review the \"additionality\" rule and temporal correlation requirements, which add an estimated \\(\\$1-2\\)/kg to green hydrogen production costs. Targeted Revisions: Proposals include relaxing strict, hourly correlation to monthly, and allowing grid electricity for electrolysis when prices are low. Shift in Strategy: Due to high costs, a shift toward non-RFNBO (low-carbon/blue) hydrogen is expected in 2026, with the EC allowing this in hydrogen bank auctions. Industry Pressure: Member states and industry players have lobbied for these changes to prevent stalling projects and to ensure that 2030 targets under RED III are achievable. Revised Targets: Some forecasts suggest that the 42% industrial RFNBO target for 2030 might be abandoned or significantly revised in 2026, with Germany's subsidy-based approach becoming a template.",

The choices made now will decide whether Europe leads the technologies that define the clean industrial era or becomes dependent on importing them from elsewhere. European electrolyser manufacturers have already shown what is possible. We have honoured our commitments, scaled annual production capacity and proven our ability to deliver world-class technology at industrial scale. Now, EU policymakers must match that ambition with policies that accelerate market demand, simplify regulation, and provide long-term investment certainty. Taken together, the measures described in this Manifesto would unlock immediate demand creating a functioning market for renewable and low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen. The market forces based on growing demand and competitive supply will lead to minimized costs, funding needs and risks for investors. Binding and monetisable RFNBO compliance, combined with an EU-wide book and claim \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d and revised rules in the RFNBO Delegated Act would ease RED III implementation across Member States, accelerate industrial and transport projects, and deliver earlier emissions cuts while laying the groundwork for the hydrogen backbone. By anchoring electrolyser manufacturing and critical component supply chains in Europe, these measures bolster resilience, reduce reliance on third country imports, and secure local high-skilled clean energy jobs. If we succeed, the benefit will be a competitive, sovereign, and resilient Europe that controls the technologies underpinning its clean-energy future, builds its own supply chains, and exports them to the world. It will mean millions of skilled jobs, and a new generation of European workers building the future rather than watching it arrive from abroad. Electrolysers can and must be the next success story for Europe: a technology driving Europe\u2019s resilience, competitiveness, and ambition. A technology Europe builds.",

          "content": "Today in the European Parliament, discussing Europe's energy future with fellow CEOs, commission and Parliament members. Europe has had a wake-up call. Energy is also about security and resilience, not just price and emissions. Europe must build and protect its own industry and supply chains for critical clean-energy equipment. Today we lead the world in electrolysers - a technology essential for decarbonisation and a strategic infrastructure supporting grid stability and energy storage. This is why global competition is intense and why Europe\u2019s position is being challenged. The prize is an industry worth hundreds of billions, with strong export potential. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said, \u201cPeople with visions should go see a doctor.\u201d He may have been right - but the electrolyser industry can deliver tens of thousands of real jobs and long-term economic growth. Europe is built on common values and fair trade. From the Nordics to the EU and the UK, we are stronger together. Trade within Europe should be open and without barriers. New legislation, including the EU Industrial Accelerator Act, must reflect this reality and support European industry, while protecting supply chains from adverse outside interference. Europe has the technology and the manufacturing base. We now also have industrial-scale reference plants. The foundations are in place. It\u2019s time to spark industrial demand with clear policy signals and planning certainty.",

          "content": "Verbatim 'Amy Adams, CFO, ITM Power plc: Yes, of course, but before I do that, let me just take a little step through the changes that have happened in revenue recognition. So I\u2019m really pleased that we\u2019ve managed to review the recognition methods. As our product portfolio grows and develops, it\u2019s really important to take that step, step back and make sure what we\u2019re doing is appropriate, and it\u2019s allowed us to implement different ways of recognizing revenue to the one that we\u2019ve historically used. So the one that we\u2019ve historically used is completed contracts, so that\u2019s where we recognize revenue at specific points in a contract when performance obligations are met. They could be. That could be delivery or commissioning, but generally towards the end of a contract\u2019s life. We will still use that method for TRIDENTs, and we\u2019ll still use that method for our standard NEPTUNE products. The difference is that NEPTUNEs that contain a customer modification, POSEIDONs or ALPHAs, will be recognized over time as we produce the equipment, and that\u2019s really important, as we\u2019ll be able to see the revenue track through the profit and loss as we are actually manufacturing, and leads to a lot more predictable revenue going forward. If I could give you a real-life example, if you take the Uniper 120-MW Humber project in the U.K., so that\u2019s currently at the FEED process. So under the old recognition methods, the completed contracts method, we would recognize a small amount of revenue as we go through that FEED study, and then effectively you would see nothing else for two to three financial periods until we get towards the end of that contract and revenue would be recognized in one lump sum. If we transfer that to the new version of percentage completion, using ALPHA or POSEIDON, we\u2019d get exactly the same revenue for the FEED study, which would be recognized at the same point in time. But the difference being that at the point that we sign the contract up until delivery, we\u2019d be able to progressively recognize revenue. In that first financial year, you would see revenue happening for that project, and in the second, and then at delivery, until you get to the same point in time. It will allow us to be able to see progress through the factory in the P&L. Dennis Schulz, CEO, ITM Power plc: I think that\u2019s a massive change, if I may add. In the past, when we signed a large contract, 100 MW, more than 100 MW, for example, you would not see relevant revenue from that contract for minimum 2-3 years, right? Then everything would come at once. Under the new PoC, percentage of completion, method, from contract signature, you will see revenue coming in. That is important because it changes the financial profile of the company quite significantly. What it means is, if we sign a new large contract, during a year, now, for the first time, you will see an immediate impact on guidance for the year, and you will see an immediate impact on the financial numbers of th",

          "content": "From AI Quote: Goldman Sachs has several notable connections to Qube Research & Technologies (QRT), a rapidly growing London-based quantitative hedge fund that manages over $30 billion. These links primarily involve the poaching of senior talent for expansion and the use of similar, high-tech, multi-manager structures. Key Connections and Personnel Naveen Arora (US Expansion): Qube hired Naveen Arora, the former co-head of US power trading at Goldman Sachs, to lead the buildout of its first US office in Houston in 2025. This move is central to Qube's expansion into physical commodity trading in the US. Tom Gorman (COO role): Tom Gorman, previously an executive director and head of hedge fund consulting at Goldman Sachs, joined Qube as a COO in their Hong Kong office. Talent Flow: Qube has actively recruited from top-tier firms, including Goldman Sachs, as it expanded to over 1,400 employees and increased its assets under management. Systematic/Quant Focus: Both firms are deeply involved in quantitative strategies. Qube is noted as a \"quant giant\" that has grown in power, similar to other major players where Goldman often acts as a prime broker or competitor. Industry Trends: Goldman Sachs research highlighted that Qube is among the prominent multi-manager (\"pod shop\") funds experiencing record growth, and Goldman's analysis of the industry often features the hiring trends and structural growth of firms like Qube. Qube was originally spun out of Credit Suisse in 2018, but has since emerged as a major independent player by hiring extensively from investment banks like Goldman Sachs.",

There should be so so (SO!) many positive announcements around the corner and each one will give a tick up with the end result a major upwards trajectory. I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about today\u2019s drop. It was late on after the USA opened , their tech stocks took an early hammering but subsequently recovered by Close. I\u2019m hoping for a part reversal tomorrow. Personally I may add more at these prices  , you have to make your own mind up but as several others have said\u2026. just a little more patience maybe?

Property is the safest bet probably but once that's covered and the kids have flown the nest you can speculate a bit. ITM would be near the top of the risk pyramid but has a lot of reward potential long term. It may be gradual or it may suddenly take off - that is the dilemma if you are unsure about holding or buying. For me it is a strong hold/buy.",

At some point we all surly have to evaluate where are money is best put? I\u2019m personally going to set a deadline of end of Feb. If the SP is still loitering around 62p come end of February I think I\u2019m going to take half out and invest in one of the AI hydro company\u2019s as I\u2019m losing patience and can\u2019t wait forever whilst other company\u2019s around  are smashing it. Just to add One of the main reasons i liked this company was the high risk / high reward potential, but now it doesn\u2019t feel high risk anymore, feels a safe bet that will prob climb but likely at a much slower rate, I feel I can have the same gains in a stock in a safer market other than green energy?

          "content": "As of 2026, RES has one of the largest onshore wind pipelines in the UK, with a heavy concentration in Scotland to support the Scottish Government\u2019s target of 20GW by 2030. Their strategy is increasingly to co-locate or pipe this energy directly to industrial green hydrogen hubs through the HYRO joint venture. 1. Onshore Wind Farms in Planning (Scotland focus) RES is currently moving several large-scale projects through the planning system. Because of the size of these turbines, most are now handled directly by the Scottish Government's Energy Consents Unit (ECU) rather than local councils. 2. Where Green Hydrogen Facilities May Be Sited Through the HYRO partnership with Octopus, RES is targeting industrial clusters where they can replace gas usage directly. While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

For the record they are not having any of mine, I don't care when they do it, I am in for the long term but would like to see the share price reflect the progress which the company is making, not some value with 24m additional shares being on the table and horse traded for short term profit.

          "content": "Have been reflecting on the Cummins situation. And seems to me the recent developments there are of benefit to ITM. \u201cThe decision is part of a broader, global restructuring of its Accelera by Cummins unit due to weak demand and ( this is the key part ) uncertainty surrounding government incentives\u201d. This seems to prove that with Trumps policy changes and the fact they can demand repayment of grants and funds from previous years as well as remove new ones. It\u2019s not good for USA companies, especially ones with extra costs of overseas shipping and operations. So for a smaller company like ITM this opens up a few opportunities. Firstly, they may be able to take agreed business and secondly it puts them further up the ladder of potential suppliers for new projects and those in negations in which Cummins was part of. This seems to be a very USA oriented issue with the governments current standing a key issue. It does not seems to reflect or negatively impact UK / EU or further still ( Australia, Asia etc ) And highlights the effectiveness of choosing the  Hydropulse model. Perhaps I\u2019m mistaken, but other key players taking a back seat can only be a positive for ITM. As long as Uk / EU demand is still there and strong. Hydropulse / Chronos hopefully with strengthen the investment case, but do hope we get some positive news soon on some of our many supposedly over due FIDs to back this theory up.",

The funding was approved under the June 2025 Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF), which allows for continued support until the end of 2030. Eligible investments under CISAF include electrolysers, fuel cells, storage technologies, compressors, ammonia crackers, pipelines, and renewable energy infrastructure across wind, solar, and hydro. The commission said the scheme can offer support for decarbonising industrial processes \u201cthrough electrification, energy efficiency and the switch to the use of renewable and electricity-based hydrogen\u201d. The production and recycling of related critical raw materials will also be covered. Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, stressed the importance of the funding for reaching Clean Industrial Deal goals, saying it would also keep \u201cpotential competition distortions\u201d to a minimum. This comes as Germany\u2019s backing of hydrogen continues to outpace that of other EU states. Berlin and Brussels recently agreed on prospective plans to transition 12GW worth of power plants in the country to hydrogen by 2045, as well as a deal that will see Germany offer up to \u20ac200m ($232m) to Canada for importing green hydrogen. Germany also made a recent push in the mobility sector, investing \u20ac220m ($260m) into establishing a trial network of hydrogen refuelling stations, a move likely directed at EU renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) targets.",

The European Commission is expected to review Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) production rules by mid-2026, driven by industry calls to ease strict, costly, and complex compliance requirements. Current rules, including strict temporal and geographical correlation, are viewed as barriers to project development, with a 2026 revision likely to focus on relaxing these criteria to unlock investments and accelerate the green hydrogen market. The 2026 review is seen as a crucial turning point to transition from strict regulatory hurdles to more pragmatic, investment-friendly policies for the European hydrogen sector. Key aspects of the upcoming 2026 RFNBO review include: Potential Rule Changes: The EC is expected to review the \"additionality\" rule and temporal correlation requirements, which add an estimated \\(\\$1-2\\)/kg to green hydrogen production costs. Targeted Revisions: Proposals include relaxing strict, hourly correlation to monthly, and allowing grid electricity for electrolysis when prices are low. Shift in Strategy: Due to high costs, a shift toward non-RFNBO (low-carbon/blue) hydrogen is expected in 2026, with the EC allowing this in hydrogen bank auctions. Industry Pressure: Member states and industry players have lobbied for these changes to prevent stalling projects and to ensure that 2030 targets under RED III are achievable. Revised Targets: Some forecasts suggest that the 42% industrial RFNBO target for 2030 might be abandoned or significantly revised in 2026, with Germany's subsidy-based approach becoming a template.",

The choices made now will decide whether Europe leads the technologies that define the clean industrial era or becomes dependent on importing them from elsewhere. European electrolyser manufacturers have already shown what is possible. We have honoured our commitments, scaled annual production capacity and proven our ability to deliver world-class technology at industrial scale. Now, EU policymakers must match that ambition with policies that accelerate market demand, simplify regulation, and provide long-term investment certainty. Taken together, the measures described in this Manifesto would unlock immediate demand creating a functioning market for renewable and low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen. The market forces based on growing demand and competitive supply will lead to minimized costs, funding needs and risks for investors. Binding and monetisable RFNBO compliance, combined with an EU-wide book and claim \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d and revised rules in the RFNBO Delegated Act would ease RED III implementation across Member States, accelerate industrial and transport projects, and deliver earlier emissions cuts while laying the groundwork for the hydrogen backbone. By anchoring electrolyser manufacturing and critical component supply chains in Europe, these measures bolster resilience, reduce reliance on third country imports, and secure local high-skilled clean energy jobs. If we succeed, the benefit will be a competitive, sovereign, and resilient Europe that controls the technologies underpinning its clean-energy future, builds its own supply chains, and exports them to the world. It will mean millions of skilled jobs, and a new generation of European workers building the future rather than watching it arrive from abroad. Electrolysers can and must be the next success story for Europe: a technology driving Europe\u2019s resilience, competitiveness, and ambition. A technology Europe builds.",

Energy is also about security and resilience, not just price and emissions. Europe must build and protect its own industry and supply chains for critical clean-energy equipment. Today we lead the world in electrolysers - a technology essential for decarbonisation and a strategic infrastructure supporting grid stability and energy storage. This is why global competition is intense and why Europe\u2019s position is being challenged. The prize is an industry worth hundreds of billions, with strong export potential. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said, \u201cPeople with visions should go see a doctor.\u201d He may have been right - but the electrolyser industry can deliver tens of thousands of real jobs and long-term economic growth. Europe is built on common values and fair trade. From the Nordics to the EU and the UK, we are stronger together. Trade within Europe should be open and without barriers. New legislation, including the EU Industrial Accelerator Act, must reflect this reality and support European industry, while protecting supply chains from adverse outside interference. Europe has the technology and the manufacturing base. We now also have industrial-scale reference plants. The foundations are in place. It\u2019s time to spark industrial demand with clear policy signals and planning certainty.",

          "content": "Verbatim 'Amy Adams, CFO, ITM Power plc: Yes, of course, but before I do that, let me just take a little step through the changes that have happened in revenue recognition. So I\u2019m really pleased that we\u2019ve managed to review the recognition methods. As our product portfolio grows and develops, it\u2019s really important to take that step, step back and make sure what we\u2019re doing is appropriate, and it\u2019s allowed us to implement different ways of recognizing revenue to the one that we\u2019ve historically used. So the one that we\u2019ve historically used is completed contracts, so that\u2019s where we recognize revenue at specific points in a contract when performance obligations are met. They could be. That could be delivery or commissioning, but generally towards the end of a contract\u2019s life. We will still use that method for TRIDENTs, and we\u2019ll still use that method for our standard NEPTUNE products. The difference is that NEPTUNEs that contain a customer modification, POSEIDONs or ALPHAs, will be recognized over time as we produce the equipment, and that\u2019s really important, as we\u2019ll be able to see the revenue track through the profit and loss as we are actually manufacturing, and leads to a lot more predictable revenue going forward. If I could give you a real-life example, if you take the Uniper 120-MW Humber project in the U.K., so that\u2019s currently at the FEED process. So under the old recognition methods, the completed contracts method, we would recognize a small amount of revenue as we go through that FEED study, and then effectively you would see nothing else for two to three financial periods until we get towards the end of that contract and revenue would be recognized in one lump sum. If we transfer that to the new version of percentage completion, using ALPHA or POSEIDON, we\u2019d get exactly the same revenue for the FEED study, which would be recognized at the same point in time. But the difference being that at the point that we sign the contract up until delivery, we\u2019d be able to progressively recognize revenue. In that first financial year, you would see revenue happening for that project, and in the second, and then at delivery, until you get to the same point in time. It will allow us to be able to see progress through the factory in the P&L. Dennis Schulz, CEO, ITM Power plc: I think that\u2019s a massive change, if I may add. In the past, when we signed a large contract, 100 MW, more than 100 MW, for example, you would not see relevant revenue from that contract for minimum 2-3 years, right? Then everything would come at once. Under the new PoC, percentage of completion, method, from contract signature, you will see revenue coming in. That is important because it changes the financial profile of the company quite significantly. What it means is, if we sign a new large contract, during a year, now, for the first time, you will see an immediate impact on guidance for the year, and you will see an immediate impact on the financial numbers of th",

Convinced by smooth talking investors no doubt, to consume more land and build risky lithium ion battery installations. Why don't government listen to the experts who understand these units and know that the required storage scale is not mere hours, but days, weeks and months if we are to rely on renewable energy significantly. See the Royal Society report . Pumped storage capacity is way off, flow-batteries not bad for medium term, but gas is king, a significant proportion of which will likely be green H2 not methane if we are to reduce GHG emissions.",

This is often because they are orchestrated by a group of individuals in a sophisticated way, carrying out what may seem like standard transactions...\" Oh, btw, The Gentleman doth protest too much, methinks, just saying ! aimo & dyor",

          "content": "From AI Quote: Goldman Sachs has several notable connections to Qube Research & Technologies (QRT), a rapidly growing London-based quantitative hedge fund that manages over $30 billion. These links primarily involve the poaching of senior talent for expansion and the use of similar, high-tech, multi-manager structures. Key Connections and Personnel Naveen Arora (US Expansion): Qube hired Naveen Arora, the former co-head of US power trading at Goldman Sachs, to lead the buildout of its first US office in Houston in 2025. This move is central to Qube's expansion into physical commodity trading in the US. Tom Gorman (COO role): Tom Gorman, previously an executive director and head of hedge fund consulting at Goldman Sachs, joined Qube as a COO in their Hong Kong office. Talent Flow: Qube has actively recruited from top-tier firms, including Goldman Sachs, as it expanded to over 1,400 employees and increased its assets under management. Systematic/Quant Focus: Both firms are deeply involved in quantitative strategies. Qube is noted as a \"quant giant\" that has grown in power, similar to other major players where Goldman often acts as a prime broker or competitor. Industry Trends: Goldman Sachs research highlighted that Qube is among the prominent multi-manager (\"pod shop\") funds experiencing record growth, and Goldman's analysis of the industry often features the hiring trends and structural growth of firms like Qube. Qube was originally spun out of Credit Suisse in 2018, but has since emerged as a major independent player by hiring extensively from investment banks like Goldman Sachs.",

At some point we all surly have to evaluate where are money is best put? I\u2019m personally going to set a deadline of end of Feb. If the SP is still loitering around 62p come end of February I think I\u2019m going to take half out and invest in one of the AI hydro company\u2019s as I\u2019m losing patience and can\u2019t wait forever whilst other company\u2019s around  are smashing it. Just to add One of the main reasons i liked this company was the high risk / high reward potential, but now it doesn\u2019t feel high risk anymore, feels a safe bet that will prob climb but likely at a much slower rate, I feel I can have the same gains in a stock in a safer market other than green energy?

Their strategy is increasingly to co-locate or pipe this energy directly to industrial green hydrogen hubs through the HYRO joint venture. 1. Onshore Wind Farms in Planning (Scotland focus) RES is currently moving several large-scale projects through the planning system. Because of the size of these turbines, most are now handled directly by the Scottish Government's Energy Consents Unit (ECU) rather than local councils. 2. Where Green Hydrogen Facilities May Be Sited Through the HYRO partnership with Octopus, RES is targeting industrial clusters where they can replace gas usage directly. While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

          "content": "Quote - Heavily shorted shares often come under sustained pressure designed to prevent them from rising, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as a \"short attack\" or a \"bear raid\". Short sellers, having bet on a price decline, may use various strategies to ensure the stock price stays down to secure a profit. Here is a breakdown of how this process works, the techniques used, and the associated risks: How Heavily Shorted Stocks Are Attacked \"Short and Distort\" Campaigns: Activist short sellers may publish negative reports, blog posts, or social media commentary highlighting unfavorable information to panic other investors into selling. Sustained Selling Pressure: Short sellers may actively sell borrowed shares in a coordinated fashion to create artificial downward pressure, attempting to push the price below a company\u2019s fundamental value. Shorting Counter trend Bounces: When a stock tries to rise, short sellers may aggressively sell into that rally to cap the price and prevent it from breaking out. High Short Interest as a Signal: When short interest exceeds 10%\u201320% of the float, it signals a crowded trade where a large number of market participants are actively working to keep the price down. The Role of Market Mechanics Lowered Confidence: The constant negative reinforcement and price suppression can cause long-term investors to lose confidence and sell. Margin Calls on Longs: If the price is forced down, it may trigger margin calls for long investors, forcing them to sell and creating further downward pressure. The Danger: The \"Short Squeeze\" While these attacks aim to stop a price rise, they also make the stock extremely volatile and vulnerable to a short squeeze. If the stock price rises despite the pressure\u2014perhaps due to positive news or high buying volume\u2014short sellers are forced to cover their positions by buying shares, which can cause the price to skyrocket rapidly. When Attacks Backfire: The same high short interest that allows for a \"sustained attack\" also acts as fuel for a violent upward surge if the bears are forced to cover. Retail/Social Media Impact: In recent years, collective buying (e.g., from platforms like Reddit) has been used to counter these attacks and trigger squeezes. In summary, heavily shorted stocks are often under intense pressure to stay down, but they are also frequently \"coiled springs\" that can experience violent, upward, \"short-squeeze\" movements if their price starts to rise.",

And seems to me the recent developments there are of benefit to ITM. \u201cThe decision is part of a broader, global restructuring of its Accelera by Cummins unit due to weak demand and ( this is the key part ) uncertainty surrounding government incentives\u201d. This seems to prove that with Trumps policy changes and the fact they can demand repayment of grants and funds from previous years as well as remove new ones. It\u2019s not good for USA companies, especially ones with extra costs of overseas shipping and operations. So for a smaller company like ITM this opens up a few opportunities. Firstly, they may be able to take agreed business and secondly it puts them further up the ladder of potential suppliers for new projects and those in negations in which Cummins was part of. This seems to be a very USA oriented issue with the governments current standing a key issue. It does not seems to reflect or negatively impact UK / EU or further still ( Australia, Asia etc ) And highlights the effectiveness of choosing the  Hydropulse model. Perhaps I\u2019m mistaken, but other key players taking a back seat can only be a positive for ITM. As long as Uk / EU demand is still there and strong. Hydropulse / Chronos hopefully with strengthen the investment case, but do hope we get some positive news soon on some of our many supposedly over due FIDs to back this theory up.",

The US market is effectively dead. And now Plug in (more) trouble. Again this only means possibility of more market share for ITM Dennis has stated many Electrolyser businesses will fall away, and only the viable ones will be left standing\u2026. Surely the last couple of days just prove that point. Sentiment in Europe (and most of the world) only seems to be moving in the right direction for Hydrogen. As Dennis said the US is not a key market for ITM in the immediate or near future. Despite the share price performance this week it\u2019s all looking very positive.

The funding was approved under the June 2025 Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF), which allows for continued support until the end of 2030. Eligible investments under CISAF include electrolysers, fuel cells, storage technologies, compressors, ammonia crackers, pipelines, and renewable energy infrastructure across wind, solar, and hydro. The commission said the scheme can offer support for decarbonising industrial processes \u201cthrough electrification, energy efficiency and the switch to the use of renewable and electricity-based hydrogen\u201d. The production and recycling of related critical raw materials will also be covered. Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, stressed the importance of the funding for reaching Clean Industrial Deal goals, saying it would also keep \u201cpotential competition distortions\u201d to a minimum. This comes as Germany\u2019s backing of hydrogen continues to outpace that of other EU states. Berlin and Brussels recently agreed on prospective plans to transition 12GW worth of power plants in the country to hydrogen by 2045, as well as a deal that will see Germany offer up to \u20ac200m ($232m) to Canada for importing green hydrogen. Germany also made a recent push in the mobility sector, investing \u20ac220m ($260m) into establishing a trial network of hydrogen refuelling stations, a move likely directed at EU renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) targets.",

          "content": "I was wondering what Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) review would bring. See below from AI. The European Commission is expected to review Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) production rules by mid-2026, driven by industry calls to ease strict, costly, and complex compliance requirements. Current rules, including strict temporal and geographical correlation, are viewed as barriers to project development, with a 2026 revision likely to focus on relaxing these criteria to unlock investments and accelerate the green hydrogen market. The 2026 review is seen as a crucial turning point to transition from strict regulatory hurdles to more pragmatic, investment-friendly policies for the European hydrogen sector. Key aspects of the upcoming 2026 RFNBO review include: Potential Rule Changes: The EC is expected to review the \"additionality\" rule and temporal correlation requirements, which add an estimated \\(\\$1-2\\)/kg to green hydrogen production costs. Targeted Revisions: Proposals include relaxing strict, hourly correlation to monthly, and allowing grid electricity for electrolysis when prices are low. Shift in Strategy: Due to high costs, a shift toward non-RFNBO (low-carbon/blue) hydrogen is expected in 2026, with the EC allowing this in hydrogen bank auctions. Industry Pressure: Member states and industry players have lobbied for these changes to prevent stalling projects and to ensure that 2030 targets under RED III are achievable. Revised Targets: Some forecasts suggest that the 42% industrial RFNBO target for 2030 might be abandoned or significantly revised in 2026, with Germany's subsidy-based approach becoming a template.",

The choices made now will decide whether Europe leads the technologies that define the clean industrial era or becomes dependent on importing them from elsewhere. European electrolyser manufacturers have already shown what is possible. We have honoured our commitments, scaled annual production capacity and proven our ability to deliver world-class technology at industrial scale. Now, EU policymakers must match that ambition with policies that accelerate market demand, simplify regulation, and provide long-term investment certainty. Taken together, the measures described in this Manifesto would unlock immediate demand creating a functioning market for renewable and low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen. The market forces based on growing demand and competitive supply will lead to minimized costs, funding needs and risks for investors. Binding and monetisable RFNBO compliance, combined with an EU-wide book and claim \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d and revised rules in the RFNBO Delegated Act would ease RED III implementation across Member States, accelerate industrial and transport projects, and deliver earlier emissions cuts while laying the groundwork for the hydrogen backbone. By anchoring electrolyser manufacturing and critical component supply chains in Europe, these measures bolster resilience, reduce reliance on third country imports, and secure local high-skilled clean energy jobs. If we succeed, the benefit will be a competitive, sovereign, and resilient Europe that controls the technologies underpinning its clean-energy future, builds its own supply chains, and exports them to the world. It will mean millions of skilled jobs, and a new generation of European workers building the future rather than watching it arrive from abroad. Electrolysers can and must be the next success story for Europe: a technology driving Europe\u2019s resilience, competitiveness, and ambition. A technology Europe builds.",

Energy is also about security and resilience, not just price and emissions. Europe must build and protect its own industry and supply chains for critical clean-energy equipment. Today we lead the world in electrolysers - a technology essential for decarbonisation and a strategic infrastructure supporting grid stability and energy storage. This is why global competition is intense and why Europe\u2019s position is being challenged. The prize is an industry worth hundreds of billions, with strong export potential. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said, \u201cPeople with visions should go see a doctor.\u201d He may have been right - but the electrolyser industry can deliver tens of thousands of real jobs and long-term economic growth. Europe is built on common values and fair trade. From the Nordics to the EU and the UK, we are stronger together. Trade within Europe should be open and without barriers. New legislation, including the EU Industrial Accelerator Act, must reflect this reality and support European industry, while protecting supply chains from adverse outside interference. Europe has the technology and the manufacturing base. We now also have industrial-scale reference plants. The foundations are in place. It\u2019s time to spark industrial demand with clear policy signals and planning certainty.",

          "content": "Verbatim 'Amy Adams, CFO, ITM Power plc: Yes, of course, but before I do that, let me just take a little step through the changes that have happened in revenue recognition. So I\u2019m really pleased that we\u2019ve managed to review the recognition methods. As our product portfolio grows and develops, it\u2019s really important to take that step, step back and make sure what we\u2019re doing is appropriate, and it\u2019s allowed us to implement different ways of recognizing revenue to the one that we\u2019ve historically used. So the one that we\u2019ve historically used is completed contracts, so that\u2019s where we recognize revenue at specific points in a contract when performance obligations are met. They could be. That could be delivery or commissioning, but generally towards the end of a contract\u2019s life. We will still use that method for TRIDENTs, and we\u2019ll still use that method for our standard NEPTUNE products. The difference is that NEPTUNEs that contain a customer modification, POSEIDONs or ALPHAs, will be recognized over time as we produce the equipment, and that\u2019s really important, as we\u2019ll be able to see the revenue track through the profit and loss as we are actually manufacturing, and leads to a lot more predictable revenue going forward. If I could give you a real-life example, if you take the Uniper 120-MW Humber project in the U.K., so that\u2019s currently at the FEED process. So under the old recognition methods, the completed contracts method, we would recognize a small amount of revenue as we go through that FEED study, and then effectively you would see nothing else for two to three financial periods until we get towards the end of that contract and revenue would be recognized in one lump sum. If we transfer that to the new version of percentage completion, using ALPHA or POSEIDON, we\u2019d get exactly the same revenue for the FEED study, which would be recognized at the same point in time. But the difference being that at the point that we sign the contract up until delivery, we\u2019d be able to progressively recognize revenue. In that first financial year, you would see revenue happening for that project, and in the second, and then at delivery, until you get to the same point in time. It will allow us to be able to see progress through the factory in the P&L. Dennis Schulz, CEO, ITM Power plc: I think that\u2019s a massive change, if I may add. In the past, when we signed a large contract, 100 MW, more than 100 MW, for example, you would not see relevant revenue from that contract for minimum 2-3 years, right? Then everything would come at once. Under the new PoC, percentage of completion, method, from contract signature, you will see revenue coming in. That is important because it changes the financial profile of the company quite significantly. What it means is, if we sign a new large contract, during a year, now, for the first time, you will see an immediate impact on guidance for the year, and you will see an immediate impact on the financial numbers of th",

Again I\u2019m certain the  company would not of mentioned Chronos in any shape or form if they thought it would negatively effect current negotiations but again, perhaps if you are reading Justin you could clear that question up?",

          "content": "From AI Quote: Goldman Sachs has several notable connections to Qube Research & Technologies (QRT), a rapidly growing London-based quantitative hedge fund that manages over $30 billion. These links primarily involve the poaching of senior talent for expansion and the use of similar, high-tech, multi-manager structures. Key Connections and Personnel Naveen Arora (US Expansion): Qube hired Naveen Arora, the former co-head of US power trading at Goldman Sachs, to lead the buildout of its first US office in Houston in 2025. This move is central to Qube's expansion into physical commodity trading in the US. Tom Gorman (COO role): Tom Gorman, previously an executive director and head of hedge fund consulting at Goldman Sachs, joined Qube as a COO in their Hong Kong office. Talent Flow: Qube has actively recruited from top-tier firms, including Goldman Sachs, as it expanded to over 1,400 employees and increased its assets under management. Systematic/Quant Focus: Both firms are deeply involved in quantitative strategies. Qube is noted as a \"quant giant\" that has grown in power, similar to other major players where Goldman often acts as a prime broker or competitor. Industry Trends: Goldman Sachs research highlighted that Qube is among the prominent multi-manager (\"pod shop\") funds experiencing record growth, and Goldman's analysis of the industry often features the hiring trends and structural growth of firms like Qube. Qube was originally spun out of Credit Suisse in 2018, but has since emerged as a major independent player by hiring extensively from investment banks like Goldman Sachs.",

There should be so so (SO!) many positive announcements around the corner and each one will give a tick up with the end result a major upwards trajectory. I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about today\u2019s drop. It was late on after the USA opened , their tech stocks took an early hammering but subsequently recovered by Close. I\u2019m hoping for a part reversal tomorrow. Personally I may add more at these prices  , you have to make your own mind up but as several others have said\u2026. just a little more patience maybe?

Property is the safest bet probably but once that's covered and the kids have flown the nest you can speculate a bit. ITM would be near the top of the risk pyramid but has a lot of reward potential long term. It may be gradual or it may suddenly take off - that is the dilemma if you are unsure about holding or buying. For me it is a strong hold/buy.",

It\u2019s so undervalued and yet despite lots of contract wins the SP is refusing to shift in alignment with this fast growing  company. At some point we all surly have to evaluate where are money is best put? I\u2019m personally going to set a deadline of end of Feb. If the SP is still loitering around 62p come end of February I think I\u2019m going to take half out and invest in one of the AI hydro company\u2019s as I\u2019m losing patience and can\u2019t wait forever whilst other company\u2019s around  are smashing it. Just to add One of the main reasons i liked this company was the high risk / high reward potential, but now it doesn\u2019t feel high risk anymore, feels a safe bet that will prob climb but likely at a much slower rate, I feel I can have the same gains in a stock in a safer market other than green energy? Interested to know Anyone else  feels the same  or has any deadlines to get out?",

          "content": "As of 2026, RES has one of the largest onshore wind pipelines in the UK, with a heavy concentration in Scotland to support the Scottish Government\u2019s target of 20GW by 2030. Their strategy is increasingly to co-locate or pipe this energy directly to industrial green hydrogen hubs through the HYRO joint venture. 1. Onshore Wind Farms in Planning (Scotland focus) RES is currently moving several large-scale projects through the planning system. Because of the size of these turbines, most are now handled directly by the Scottish Government's Energy Consents Unit (ECU) rather than local councils. 2. Where Green Hydrogen Facilities May Be Sited Through the HYRO partnership with Octopus, RES is targeting industrial clusters where they can replace gas usage directly. While their first major wins were in England and Wales, their Scottish strategy focuses on three key areas: \u2022 The Grangemouth Cluster: As Scotland\u2019s largest industrial area, this is a primary target. RES/HYRO are looking at sites that can feed the refinery and petrochemical plants, competing with RWE\u2019s nearby hydrogen proposals. \u2022 The Whiskey Industry (Speyside/Highlands): RES has a massive presence in Moray and the Highlands (e.g., Hill of Towie, Aberarder). They are exploring \"decentralized\" hydrogen facilities near these wind farms to supply green heat to nearby distilleries that are off the main gas grid. \u2022 Ayrshire Industrial Hub: Building on their wind assets in East Ayrshire (like Sclenteuch), they are eyeing industrial sites in this region to create a local hydrogen economy for heavy transport and manufacturing. 3. Investment Indicators In 2026, the \"look\" of their investment will shift from pure electricity generation to \"integrated energy hubs.\" \u2022 The \u00a33 Billion Fund: You will likely see HYRO announce \"Behind the Meter\" projects, where a wind farm connects directly to an electrolyser on an industrial site, bypassing some grid charges to make the hydrogen cheaper. \u2022 Allocation Round 7 (AR7): Keep an eye on the UK Government\u2019s AR7 results later this year. RES/HYRO typically use these rounds to secure the guaranteed price (CfD) needed to finalize their \u00a33bn investment decisions.",

Surely any gain they have from the shares they are holding, is cancelled out 1:1  with any loss on the shares which they have borrowed? It is like a zero sum game with a rent attached. For ease of numbers lets say they bought 24 million shares when the price was 26p ( so they hold the same number of shares which they have borrowed), they are enjoying the price rise up to 68p, but all of the shares which they have to buy back to cover the short has lost them exactly the same on the way up, then they have to cover the rent / interest on the borrowing ??? I understand that this would have locked in their profit at 26p but why keep the short open when you now have the ability to close it with shares which you have bought?  This is now \"dead holdings\" for them, which surely a hedge fund want their investment working,  not invested into a vehicle which cannot make any profit as it remains the same whichever way the stock moves ?? Also are there not rules in place to stop this practice, they have to declare \"net position\" to the FSA? If they have been \"trading\" on the way up and taking profits I could see the argument but just buying and holding makes no sense at all to me. Am I missing something?",

For the record they are not having any of mine, I don't care when they do it, I am in for the long term but would like to see the share price reflect the progress which the company is making, not some value with 24m additional shares being on the table and horse traded for short term profit.
