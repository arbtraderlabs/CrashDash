The calculation methodology is set out in\nNote 3.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM, said:\n\"We have yet again delivered our strongest six-month revenue performance to date while maintaining strict cash and operational discipline.\nIn the first half of the financial year, commercial activity has progressed well with the award of multiple equipment supply contracts, several engineering contracts, a significant capacity reservation from RWE, an important repeat customer, and beyond that our selection as electrolyser provider for several other upcoming projects. This progress underpins customer confidence and market traction in an environment which had to fight with known headwinds.\nThe Hydropulse business was well received at its launch and has since progressed several project discussions, supporting ITM's move towards recurring profitable revenue. Furthermore, Hydropulse is lining itself up to play a role in various government-backed funding programmes including HAR3 in the UK and various schemes in Germany.\nQ4 saw the launch of our new product, ALPHA 50, the world's most competitive full-scope and highly efficient green hydrogen plant solution, which has generated strong interest among large-scale industrial customers.\nWhile FID timing, of course, remains customer-led, we are closely engaged with our customers across many projects, and we expect FID momentum to continue accelerating through 2026 and beyond.\nCHRONOS, our next-generation stack platform, has continued to progress through development and validation to plan. We are confident that, once launched, CHRONOS will be a true gamechanger for the electrolyser industry.\nProject progress has been solid. To pick a few: The world's most advanced and largest PEM electrolyser plant, Lingen 1, for RWE has seen all 100 MW of TRIDENT stacks and skids installed and pressure-tested on time. For the second 100 MW, Lingen 2, all TRIDENT skids and already 40% of the stacks have been installed. The Leuna project with Linde is also nearing completion.\nThere is no doubt that green hydrogen will play an essential role in the decarbonisation of global industries and energy systems. Despite wider macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, clean hydrogen continues to progress at pace, with committed investments having risen elevenfold from $10bn to $110bn between 2020 and 2025\n[1]\n. Growth remains strongly supported by policy, increasing industrial demand, and ongoing sector consolidation - strengthening the foundations for a more resilient and commercially viable market.\"\nDennis Schulz, Amy Grey, and Simon Bourne will present to analysts and investors at 9:00 a.m. GMT.\nThe presentation will be via the Investor Meet Company platform.

Morgan Cazenove\nRichard Perelman, Charles Oakes\n+44 (0) 20 7742 4000\nAbout ITM Power plc:\nITM Power was founded in 2000 and ITM Power plc was admitted to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in 2004. Headquartered in Sheffield, England, ITM Power designs and manufactures electrolysers based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology to produce green hydrogen, the only net zero energy gas, using renewable electricity and water.\nINTERIM REVIEW\nOperational update\nWe have continued to strengthen operational execution, disciplined cost management and capital allocation. We have also continued to advance our market-leading technology and product portfolio. This tangible progress underpins our ability to deliver high-quality, scalable electrolysers at highly competitive cost, positioning us for sustained margin improvement.\n\u00b7\nProcess and capabilities:\nWe continue to focus on manufacturing quality and process control. In parallel, we have halved electrolysis time during Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT), increasing throughput and reducing energy costs. We have received and installed our new autostacker manufacturing line, a key next step in automation that substantially reduces manual work in stack assembly. The new autostacker has a stack assembly capability of over 2 GW.\n\u00b7\nProduct portfolio:\nTowards the end of H1, we launched ALPHA 50, our flagship 50 MW full-scope green hydrogen plant, designed to set a new benchmark for cost-competitive, industrial-scale hydrogen production. Priced at only \u20ac50m, ALPHA 50 is materially more competitive than comparable solutions, regardless of technology or supplier. Customer interest has exceeded expectations, with discussions underway across multiple projects spanning a broad customer base. We expect ALPHA 50 to be just as successful as our most sought-after product NEPTUNE V.\n\u00b7\nTechnology development:\nDevelopment of CHRONOS, our next-generation stack platform, continues in line with planned milestones for development and validation. CHRONOS remains central to ITM's roadmap to lower plant Capex and Opex, enhancing performance and expanding the addressable market.\n\u00b7\nSales pipeline:\nOur sales pipeline remains robust, with strong demand for NEPTUNE V, our containerised 5 MW electrolyser plant. The launch of ALPHA 50 has further strengthened the depth and quality of the pipeline. Subsequent to the half-year, ITM was awarded a contract with Octopus Energy Generation for three NEPTUNE V units to decarbonise yet another hard-to-abate industrial application.\nHydropulse:\nOur new BOO platform has been well received by customers. The business has established offices in Berlin and Sheffield and is building an experienced team to support project origination and delivery. Hydropulse is developing several projects, with strong and growing customer interest. Hydropulse will contribute recurring, asset-backed revenue and profit streams.\nHydropulse is destined to play a role in various government funding programmes including HAR3 in the UK and various schemes in Germany.\nIncome statement\nHistorically, ITM has recognised revenue under the completed-contracts method, at specific milestones such as delivery, testing or commissioning, depending on individual contract terms. This approach has historically resulted in lumpy revenue recognition, with timing influenced by customer actions and project milestones.\nAs our product portfolio has expanded and matured, we have reviewed the appropriateness of this methodology for new contracts. While TRIDENT and standard NEPTUNE products are expected to continue under the completed-contract approach, non-standard NEPTUNE, POSEIDON, and ALPHA products are increasingly suited to a percentage-of-completion (PoC) method, enabling revenue to be recognised progressively over the life of the contract.\nThis transition is underway and is strategically important as it aligns revenue recognition with value creation, improves revenue visibility, and reduces dependency on end-point customer actions, supporting a more predictable financial profile as the business scales.\nThe percentage of profitable contracts in our contracted order backlog continues to grow, now standing at 71%, up from 60% in April 2025. The remaining legacy projects, which do not contribute to margin but are fully provided for, are expected to be recognised over the next 18 months.\nRevenue for the period was \u00a318.0m (H1 2025: \u00a315.5m). Of this, \u00a315.5m is from equipment sale contracts, of which \u00a313.9m of this is recognised using the completed-contracts method, driven predominantly by deliveries against Lingen 1, and \u00a31.6m from equipment sale contracts which are recognised over time.\nIncome of \u00a31.1m (H1 2025: \u00a30.2m) was received from maintenance and upgrades, while \u00a31.4m (H1 2025: \u00a31.1m) was recognised from engineering contracts.\nThe gross loss was \u00a36.5m (H1 2025: \u00a310.2m), predominantly due to the under-absorption of factory costs.\nThe Company posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of \u00a311.9m (H1 2025: \u00a316.8m) for the period. The administrative expenses presented in the income statement are net of costs booked to inventory or development costs.\nThe loss before tax was \u00a314.1m (H1 2025: \u00a328.8m), the prior year includes exceptional costs in the period.\nCash flow and balance sheet\nCapital expenditure totalled \u00a36.9m in the period (H1 2025: \u00a35.4m), with \u00a34.5m (H1 2025: \u00a33.4m) invested in fixed assets and investment in new product development (intangible assets) of \u00a32.4m (H1 2025: \u00a32.0m).\nThe working capital inflow in the first half was \u00a312.7m, with receivables and payables increasing by \u00a37.1m and \u00a314.9m respectively, offset by a decrease in inventories of \u00a34.9m.\nInventories held decreased to \u00a351.1m from \u00a373.0m in the prior year and \u00a356.0m at 30 April 2025. The inventory has primarily been processed into finished subsystems and products, with the raw materials balance reducing from \u00a37.8m (31 October 2025) to \u00a34.3m.\nCash at 31 October 2025 was \u00a3198m (31 October 2024: \u00a3203m), representing an outflow since the year-end of \u00a39.2m as we continued manufacturing customer commitments for which cash had been received in previous periods. Finance income in the period was \u00a34.1m (H1 2025: \u00a35.5m), representing an annual average interest rate of c.4%.\nMarket update\nIt is clear that hydrogen will play a critical role in the energy transition and industrial decarbonisation. In many sectors, only a few viable alternatives exist. Refining, ammonia, heavy industry and industrial heat are structurally difficult to decarbonise, and electrification alone will be insufficient to achieve global net-zero ambitions, positioning green hydrogen as an essential solution. The same applies to grid balancing in an increasingly green and fluctuating electricity mix.\nIn September 2025, the International Energy Agency noted that, while deployment has been slower than originally targeted, the hydrogen sector continues to demonstrate progress and reach key milestones, rather than stalling. Importantly, the IEA highlighted that Europe has the world's largest project pipeline, accounting for nearly one-quarter of announced global production capacity by 2030, underlining the scale and durability of regional demand. The Hydrogen Council and McKinsey have tracked global clean hydrogen project investments and highlighted an elevenfold increase from $10bn to $110bn between 2020 and 2025, representing a massive and accelerating growth.\nAt the EU level, the regulatory framework continues to mature in favour of green hydrogen adoption. Under the Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III), the EU mandates that 42% of hydrogen used in industry must be renewable by 2030, alongside a 1% renewable hydrogen requirement in transport fuels. From January 2026, the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requires carbon costs to be paid on imported emissions-intensive products, while free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) will be progressively reduced, structurally improving the competitiveness of green hydrogen in heavy industry.\nThe EU is also reinforcing this regulatory push with material funding support. In December, \u20ac5.2bn of EU ETS proceeds were allocated across three new programmes, including \u20ac2.9bn for clean technology manufacturing and industrial decarbonisation under the Innovation Fund, \u20ac1.3bn for the third EU Hydrogen Bank auction, and c.\u20ac1.8bn of national co-funding from Germany and Spain for hydrogen and industrial heat projects. Together, these measures provide long-term demand visibility, funding depth, and bankability for large-scale green hydrogen deployment.\nIn the UK, the government reaffirmed its commitment to hydrogen at the November Budget, including plans to publish an updated UK Hydrogen Strategy and to launch HAR3 in 2026 and HAR4 from 2028, providing ongoing visibility on revenue support mechanisms. In addition, GB Energy published its strategic plan in December, targeting the mobilisation of \u00a315bn of private capital by 2030, including \u00a31bn earmarked for clean energy technologies.\nTangible progress continues across projects supported under HAR1. In August, the company announced a supply agreement with MorGen Energy for the 20 MW West Wales Hydrogen project, followed in December by a 12.5 MW contract with Octopus Energy Generation to deploy NEPTUNE V systems at Kimberly-Clark's Northfleet manufacturing site. Progress has also been made on HAR2 shortlisted projects, including FEED contracts announced in October for a multi-unit NEPTUNE V deployment and for Uniper's 120 MW Humber H2ub\u00ae project, supporting future commercial momentum.\nBoard changes\nIn October, the Board was strengthened by the appointment of Sir Warren East and John Howarth as Non-Executive Directors, while Denise Cockrem stepped down. Sir Warren brings extensive global leadership experience across technology and engineering, including serving as CEO of ARM and Rolls\n\u2011\nRoyce. John adds deep financial expertise and is currently a Partner at S&W LLP.\nIn January 2026, J\u00fcrgen Nowicki was appointed Non-Executive Chair, succeeding Sir Roger Bone. J\u00fcrgen brings deep industrial expertise and a strong track record in the global hydrogen and industrial gases sectors, most recently serving as CEO of Linde Engineering and as a member of Linde plc's Executive Leadership Team.\nFinancial guidance for FY26\nITM's financial performance in the first half of the year was in line with our expectations, and we reiterate guidance for the full year:\n\u00b7\nFull-year revenue of \u00a335m to \u00a340m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA loss range between \u00a327m and \u00a329m\n\u00b7\nNet cash at year-end in the range of \u00a3170 to 175m.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nResults for the six months ended 31 October 2025\nNote\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n2\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nCost of sales\n(24,500)\n(25,722)\n(49,726)\nGross loss\n(6,474)\n(10,188)\n(23,686)\nAdministrative expenses\n(11,522)\n(23,894)\n(34,275)\nOther income - government grants\n2\n559\n295\n3,420\nLoss from operations before exceptional items\n(17,437)\n(20,705)\n(41,451)\nExceptional items\n7\n-\n(13,082)\n(13,090)\nLoss from operations\n(17,437)\n(33,787)\n(54,541)\nShare of loss of associate companies\n-\n(2)\n(5)\nFinance income\n4,066\n5,496\n10,168\nFinance costs\n(714)\n(499)\n(985)\nLoss before tax\n(14,085)\n(28,792)\n(45,363)\nTax\n(75)\n(68)\n(152)\nLoss after tax\n(14,160)\n(28,860)\n(45,515)\nOther comprehensive income:\nForeign currency translation differences on foreign operations\n(6)\n(142)\n(46)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(14,166)\n(29,002)\n(45,561)\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n(2.3p)\n(4.7p)\n(7.4p)\nWeighted average number of shares\n617,370,989\n617,175,156\n617,273,073\nAll results presented above are derived from continuing operations.\nThe loss per ordinary share and diluted loss per share are equal because share options are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if their issue would decrease the net profit per share.

Whilst the financial information has been compiled in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of UK-adopted international accounting standards (IFRSs), it does not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRSs. This interim financial information does not constitute statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 435 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information has\nbeen prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are as applied in the Group's latest audited financial statements.\nAs permitted, this interim report has been prepared in accordance with the AIM rules and not in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim financial reporting\".\nThe information relating to the year ended 30 April 2025 has been extracted from the Group's published financial statements for that year, which contain an unqualified audit report that does not draw attention to any matters of emphasis, and did not contain statements under section 498(2) and 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006 and which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies.\nSelected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at the year ended 30 April 2025.\nGoing Concern\nThe Directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the period ending 31 January 2027. This forecast indicates that the Group and parent company would expect to remain cash positive without the requirement for further fund raising based on delivering the existing pipeline, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these summary accounts.\nBy the end of the period analysed, the Group expect to hold funds sufficient to trade for a minimum of a further year if the business continued to operate in a similar way beyond the forecast period.\nThis cash flow forecast has also been stress tested. As a worst-case scenario, if all payments had to continue as forecast while receipts were not received at all, the business would remain cash positive for the full twelve months from the date of approval of these summary accounts.\nThe interim summary accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.\n2.\nRevenue and other operating income\nAn analysis of the Group's revenue is as follows:\nSix months to 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue from product sales recognised over time\n1,567\n-\n-\nRevenue from product sales recognised at point in time\n13,962\n13,820\n22,533\nEngineering contracts recognised at point in time\n1,393\n1,072\n1,755\nMaintenance contracts recognised at point in time\n1,104\n208\n900\nFuel sales\n-\n94\n131\nOther\n-\n340\n721\nRevenue in the Consolidated Income Statement\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nGrant income (claims made for projects)\n259\n24\n85\nOther government grants (R&D claims)\n300\n271\n3,335\nGrant income in the Consolidated Income Statement\n559\n295\n3,420\n18,585\n15,829\n29,460\nThe \"Other\" category includes contractual revenues recognised at point in time but not classified elsewhere as not involving the transfer of goods or the completion of maintenance or consultancy services.\nRevenues from major products and services\nThe Group's revenues from its major products and services were as follows:\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nPower\n12,755\n74\n1,911\nTransport\n2,339\n251\n1,401\nIndustry\n1,888\n13,896\n20,379\nOther\n1,044\n1,313\n2,349\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nThe \"Other\" category contains consultancy values that cannot be allocated to a single product group.\nGEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nA geographical analysis of the Group's revenue is set out below:\nSix months to 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended\n30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nUnited Kingdom\n2,349\n985\n1,627\nGermany\n15,319\n11,966\n21,306\nRest of Europe\n289\n774\n1,299\nJapan\n-\n1,672\n1,672\nRest of World\n69\n137\n136\n18,026\n15,534\n26,040\nThe table has been restated for the prior periods to combine individual countries into the rest of world category, where amounts were not individually material.\nThe following accounted for more than 10% of total revenue:\nSix months to 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nCustomer A\n<10%\n10,753\n10,753\nCustomer B\n12,571\nN/A\nN/A\nCustomer C\nN/A\n1,672\n<10%\nCustomer D\n<10%\nN/A\n9,037\n3.\nCalculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nIn reporting EBITDA, management use the metric of adjusted EBITDA, removing the effect of the non-repeating costs that are not directly linked to the trading performance of the business in the period under review:\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\nLoss from operations\n(17,437)\n(33,787)\n(54,541)\nAdd back:\nDepreciation\n2,830\n2,329\n4,927\nAmortisation\n1,330\n1,188\n2,454\n(Gain) / loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n688\n-\n(10)\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\nNon-underlying share-based payment charge\n710\n403\n1,053\nExceptional Items\n-\n13,083\n13,090\n(11,879)\n(16,784)\n(33,027)\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative performance measure (APM) as it allows better monitoring of the operations.

The discount applied to this is amortising over the lease term.\nThe warranty provision represents management's best estimate of the Group's liability under warranties granted on products, based on knowledge of the products and their components gained both through internal testing and monitoring of equipment in the field. As with any product warranty, there is an inherent uncertainty around the likelihood and timing of a fault occurring that would trigger further work or part replacement. Warranties are usually granted for a period of one year, although two-year warranties are the standard within some jurisdictions.\nThe provision for contract losses is created when it becomes known that a commercial contract has become onerous. The provision is based on best estimates and information known at the time to ensure the expected losses are recognised immediately through profit and loss. The effects of discounting on non-current balances were not deemed to be material. The provision created in the year is allocated against two projects. This provision will be used to offset the costs of the project as it reaches completion in future periods. Contract loss provisions are recognised as greater than one year based on the expected completion of the contract.\nProvision is also made at the point when project forecasts suggest that the contractual clauses for liquidated damages might be triggered. The other provisions category relates to potential liquidated damages for overruns on contracts with customers. The release last year was attributable to renegotiations of contract terms. The provision also represents management's best current estimate of monies that could be refundable to grant bodies for non-completion of works.\nLastly, there is a provision for Employer's NIC due on share options as they exercise.\n6.\nNotes to the Cashflow Statement\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nLoss from operations\n(17,436)\n(33,787)\n(54,541)\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n2,830\n2,332\n4,927\nLoss / (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n688\n-\n(10)\nAmortisation\n1,330\n1,189\n2,454\nShare based payment (as seen through equity)\n494\n382\n980\nForeign exchange on intercompany transactions\n(8)\n(178)\n(80)\nOperating cash flows before\nmovements in working capital\n(12,102)\n(30,062)\n(46,270)\nDecrease / (increase) in inventories\n4,888\n(2,583)\n14,408\n(Increase) / decrease in receivables\n(7,132)\n4,521\n7,808\nIncrease / (decrease) in payables\n14,941\n(959)\n12,074\n(Decrease) / increase in provisions\n(5,642)\n2,542\n(7,121)\nCash used in operations\n(5,047)\n(26,541)\n(19,101)\nInterest paid\n(679)\n(471)\n(919)\nIncome taxes paid\n(189)\n-\n-\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(5,915)\n(27,012)\n(20,020)\nCash Burn\nCash burn is a measure used by key management personnel to monitor the performance of the business.\nSix months to 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nSix months to 31 October 2024 (unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 April 2025 (audited)\n\u00a3'000\nDecrease in Cash and Cash equivalents per the cash flow statement\n(9,175)\n(27,223)\n(23,339)\nEffect of foreign exchange rates\n(18)\n9\n32\nLess share issue proceeds (net)\n-\n(118)\n(118)\nCash Burn\n(9,193)\n(27,332)\n(23,425)\n7.\nRelated Parties\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

The green hydrogen will power a new dual-fuel boiler system at the mill, which can operate on hydrogen or natural gas to generate the steam needed for paper manufacturing.\nThe Northfleet system will be financed through funds managed by Octopus Energy Generation and is being developed through HYRO, Octopus's dedicated green hydrogen development vehicle, created to drive decarbonisation across hard-to-electrify, energy-intensive industries.\nHYRO was awarded funding under the UK Government's Hydrogen Allocation Round 1 (HAR1), and this contract with ITM further advances the project. The facility is anticipated to be operational by the end of the calendar year 2027.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM Power, said\n, \"We are proud that\u00a0Octopus has selected us for this ground-breaking project, which will showcase the role of green hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the hard-to-electrify parts of the UK's manufacturing industry.\"\nAlex Brierley, Co-Head of Octopus Energy Generation's funds team, said,\n\"Heavy industries are a big part of global emissions, and with HYRO, we're determined to tackle this challenge head-on. Seeing Northfleet take shape is a fantastic signal, showcasing how building clean energy infrastructure and strengthening UK industry go hand in hand.\"\nDan Howell, Vice President and Managing Director at Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland, said:\n\"This is a significant investment into a green hydrogen solution, and alongside other investments that support our ambition to move our UK manufacturing operations to 100% renewable energy. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy-intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.
