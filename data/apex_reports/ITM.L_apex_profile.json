The green hydrogen will power a new dual-fuel boiler system at the mill, which can operate on hydrogen or natural gas to generate the steam needed for paper manufacturing.\nThe Northfleet system will be financed through funds managed by Octopus Energy Generation and is being developed through HYRO, Octopus's dedicated green hydrogen development vehicle, created to drive decarbonisation across hard-to-electrify, energy-intensive industries.\nHYRO was awarded funding under the UK Government's Hydrogen Allocation Round 1 (HAR1), and this contract with ITM further advances the project. The facility is anticipated to be operational by the end of the calendar year 2027.\nDennis Schulz, CEO of ITM Power, said\n, \"We are proud that\u00a0Octopus has selected us for this ground-breaking project, which will showcase the role of green hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the hard-to-electrify parts of the UK's manufacturing industry.\"\nAlex Brierley, Co-Head of Octopus Energy Generation's funds team, said,\n\"Heavy industries are a big part of global emissions, and with HYRO, we're determined to tackle this challenge head-on. Seeing Northfleet take shape is a fantastic signal, showcasing how building clean energy infrastructure and strengthening UK industry go hand in hand.\"\nDan Howell, Vice President and Managing Director at Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland, said:\n\"This is a significant investment into a green hydrogen solution, and alongside other investments that support our ambition to move our UK manufacturing operations to 100% renewable energy. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy-intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power plc\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.
