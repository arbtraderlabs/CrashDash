Details of these can be found below and a full copy of the interim results statement can be viewed on the Company\u2019s website.\nHighlights:\nRestructuring completed in relation to amounts owing to Directors and former Directors in excess of \u20ac3.3 million including a write off of \u20ac680,000 with the balance being deferred and ultimately repayable from success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price.\nOversubscribed private placement at 10.0p raising approximately \u20ac2.0 million (\u00a31.7 million) with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5 million (\u00a30.4 million) from the exercise of warrants during the period.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at Clontibret covering ca 2,000 metres commenced in November with the planned holes aiming to follow on the gold and antimony plunge trends at Clontibret identified during the detailed relogging project.\nNet assets of the group were \u20ac22,407,969 as at 30 November 2025 and the group made a profit for the six-month period of \u20ac278,636 after the effects of the debt write off.\nJohn Sherman, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe balance sheet repair delivered during the reporting period, including fundraisings involving both new and existing shareholders, is allowing the Company to purposefully advance its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at the Clontibret gold deposit commenced at the end of the reporting period; the work aims to assess the potential for higher-grade structurally controlled gold mineralization at depth to expand the deposit, as well as testing the antimony-bearing lode system for its potential contribution to project economics.\nI look forward to seeing the initial results of this work by the end of the current calendar quarter.\"\nAbout the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d Project\nConroy Gold\u2019s \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project in Ireland is defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100% held under license by the Company, and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit.\nThe Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions.\nThe Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest.\nGold occurs in multiple styles in the Company\u2019s license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit. There are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs\u201d targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel: +353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel: +44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-203-764 2341\nTel: +44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel: +353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\nChairman\u2019s statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI present your Company\u2019s Half-Yearly Report and Condensed Financial Statements for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025.\nThe critical action for the Company in the period was the repair to its balance sheet through two steps as follows:\n1) in late August 2025 when the share price was 5.3p, the Company entered into an agreement with certain current and former directors (\u201cthe Participants\u201d) to restructure amounts owed to them (in excess of \u20ac3.3M) into success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price; and 2) in October 2025, the Company closed an\noversubscribed private placement at 10p raising \u20ac2.0M (c. \u00a31.7M), with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5M (c. \u00a30.4M) coming from the exercise of 12-month warrants at 9.5p issued as part of the Company\u2019s October 2024 fundraising.\nFurther details on these two steps are in my letter sent to shareholders dated 26 November 2025 along with the Company\u2019s Annual Report for 2025.\nTo close my comments on this action, I was pleased to see shareholders vote at the AGM in December to approve the August agreement with near unanimity, allowing the Company to have a clear focus on the futur"

These three gold zones include 2 metres at 2.1 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au), 1.5 metres at 3.2 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au) and 0.5 metre at 0.8 g/t Au. The first gold mineralisation was intersected at a relatively shallow down hole depth of 27.5 metres.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two style of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork. The assay results reported on today relate to the lode style mineralisation.\nThe stockwork resource also contributes to the overall contained ounces. Three previous drill holes totalling 1,053 metres in a step out drilling programme have also demonstrated, through intersections of gold in the stockwork, that the Clontibret gold deposit extends 375 metres to the north-east (announced by the Company on 18 January 2023).\nThe lode gold zone intersections between the Clontibret gold resource and the Corcaskea gold target, which were reported in the assay results from this drill hole, open up the surrounding area for further step out drilling and the probability of linking the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret resource area which are 535 metres apart.\nThe drill hole was drilled to a down hole depth of 268.5 metres at a -60 degree angle and drilled to the east (Azimuth 090).\nDrill Hole Intersections:\n\u2022\n2.0m\n@ 2.1 g/t Au from\n27.5m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au from\n28.5m\n\u2022\n1.5m\n@ 3.2 g/t Au from\n40.0m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au from\n41.0m\n\u2022\n0.5m\n@ 0.8 g/t Au from\n88.5m\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented)\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe Board believes that these results provide further evidence of the continuity between the Clontibret gold target and the Corcaskea area, where excellent gold intersections have been recorded in trenching, including 16.5 metres at 6.5 g/t gold, and 12 metres at 4.9 g/t gold.\nThe results are also a further indication of the overall gold potential of the 65 km gold trend which the Company has discovered. Many other gold targets have been identified along the trend including, for example, the Clay Lake gold target, which has a far larger gold-in-soil target footprint than Clontibret.\nIn addition to Clontibret, the Board looks forward to demonstrating the overall potential of the gold trend, on which in the north-eastern segment alone, we have a gold exploration target of 8.8 million ounces in addition to the JORC resource of 517,000 oz gold.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377"

The programme is being carried out in association with the Company\u2019s joint venture partner, Demir Export A.?.\nThe Clay Lake gold target in\nCounty Armagh\nis one of a series of targets discovered by the Company along the 65 km (45 Mile) gold trend. A JORC resource of 517,000oz/Au has been estimated on a small part of the Clontibret gold deposit in\nCounty Monaghan\n(previously announced by the Company on\n28 July 2017\n).\nThe step out drilling programme at the Clay Lake gold target forms part of an overall assessment of the gold and base metal potential of the joint venture area. Eight holes on the Derryhennet section of the Clay Lake gold target, totalling approximately\n2,000m\n, are planned initially. Drilling is also planned in due course on other targets along the gold trend.\nThe overall Clay Lake gold target forms a single large gold-in-soil anomaly, over 200 Ha (c.500 acres) in area and is nearly 3km in length, which in places is 2km wide (as previously announced by the Company on\n28 January 2016\n). This is a much larger gold-in-soil footprint than at the Clontibret gold target. The drilling programme at Clay Lake will step out from the known gold mineralisation, where previous trenching and drilling has yielded trenching results of up to\n5m\nat 3.0g/t gold and, drilling, a continuous gold intersection of\n100m\nat 0.6g/t gold (including\n11.8m\nat 1.4g/t Au).\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cI am delighted to see drilling at the Clay Lake gold target. The initial drilling programme at Clay Lake forms part of the overall assessment of the gold trend which the Company has discovered. We are, of course, looking at an entire new gold district which contains many gold targets along the trend, including the Clontibret gold deposit, where results have been excellent including the recent drilling that demonstrated the continuity between that deposit and the Corcaskea gold target.\nI would also like to refer interested parties to the Company website where there is a map showing the location of the trend and the areas that have been identified, giving a picture of its potential and the work being undertaken.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com"

The exploration programme is being carried out in conjunction with the Company\u2019s joint venture partner, Demir Export A.?.\nThe discovery was made during prospecting over the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Newtownhamilton) option area in\nCounty Armagh\nin\nNorthern Ireland\n. The discovery location is south of the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Keady) option area, which contains the Company\u2019s\nClay Lake\ngold discovery.\nVisible gold was observed at two locations within the new discovery area.\nAssay results, from five quartz samples, located on or close to the surface, returned values of 123.0 g/t Au, 76.7 g/t Au, 44.1 g/t Au, 35.2 g/t Au and 12.8 g/t Au, respectively. The assay results of 123.0 g/t Au, 76.7 g/t Au and 44.1 g/t Au are the highest gold assay results returned since the Company began exploration in the Longford\u2013Down Massif. All samples were analysed by ALS (OMAC Laboratories), Loughrea, using 30g fire assay fusion with gravimetric finish (method code Au-GRA21).\nA trenching and drilling programme is planned to follow up on the discovery and to enable the Company to better assess and understand the mineralisation in the area.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThis new discovery is potentially a transformational event for gold exploration and development in this very large gold district. The presence of visible gold and the outstanding gold grades of up to 123g/t gold (4oz/t gold) in these initial samples are exceptional and, taken in conjunction with the Company\u2019s other significant discoveries, indicate the potential for the district to become a Tier 1 gold area.\u201c\nFor further information please contact:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com"

The period has been one of great progress for the Company. The Company\u2019s Joint Venture (\u201cJV\u201d) with Demir Export A.S (\u201cDemir Export\u201d) is now well underway to continue the exploration and development of the new district scale gold trend which\nConroy Gold\ndiscovered in the Longford-Down Massif in\nIreland\n.\nA new gold discovery was made post period as announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n, with visible gold and assay results of up to 123 g/t gold in quartz breccia samples during prospecting over the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Newtownhamilton) option area in\nCounty Armagh\nin\nNorthern Ireland\n. The new discovery is potentially a transformational event for gold exploration and development in the Company\u2019s licence area and, taken in conjunction with the Company\u2019s other significant discoveries, indicates the potential for the district to become a Tier I gold area.\nTechnical Results\nTechnical results during the period and post period end included excellent drilling results. A step-out drilling programme on the stockwork demonstrated an extension of over 375 metres to the northeast of the Clontibret gold deposit and extended the bedrock gold mineralisation further outside the gold-in-soil footprint at Clontibret which has a surface area of c.125 hectares.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two styles of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork.\nThree gold lodes, with grades up to 8.3 g/t over 0.5 metres, were intersected in a drill hole located approximately 200 metres to the south of the Corcaskea gold target. This has yielded significant gold intersections in trenches, including 16.5 metres of 6.5 g/t gold and 12 metres of 4.9 g/t gold. The drill hole was 70 metres north-east of the gold outcrop (5.6 g/t gold) discovery which was the crucial first step in establishing continuity between the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret gold deposit, on which the Company has defined a gold resou"
