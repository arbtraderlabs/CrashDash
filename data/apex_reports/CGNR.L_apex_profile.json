The drill holes are designed to follow up on the gold and antimony plunge trends identified during the detailed re-logging project, as first announced on 27 February 2025.\nFirst Deep Drill Hole Underway\nThe first hole, now in progress, is planned to target the major stockwork zone located beneath the historic Tullybuck Antimony Mine, at approximately 500 metres vertical depth. This hole represents the deepest drilling undertaken on the Clontibret deposit to date.\nThe hole has been designed to intersect more than ten identified lodes before reaching the deeper stockwork zone target. The objective is to enhance the geological understanding of the system and assess the potential for higher-grade, structurally controlled mineralisation at depth.\nFollow-Up Drill Holes\nThe second and third drill holes will test the strike extension of the antimony-bearing lode system toward a postulated northern fault zone believed to separate the Corcaskea mineralisation from the main Clontibret deposit. The holes will also test several of the central gold lodes.\nA second drill-rig is expected to be mobilised before year-end to accelerate this portion of the programme.\nThis drill programme represents the first phase of systematic deeper exploration at Clontibret and is an important step toward evaluating the deposit's potential to host higher-grade mineralisation at depth.\nMr John Sherman, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThis initial package of drilling follows on from the insights into plunge controls at the Clontibret target gained from the re-logging effort.\nThe aim of this body of work is to begin to assess the potential for gold in the system at depth, as well the contribution of antimony to the attractiveness of Clontibret.\"\nAbout Clontibret\nClontibret lies within a major transatlantic structural corridor that extends from Canada, through Ireland, and into Scotland. Within the Irish segment of this corridor, Conroy Gold has established the foundations of two district-scale gold trends spanning more than 95 kilometres of surface gold anomalism. These trends occur entirely within the Company's 100%-owned licence area, which covers a dominant 1,000 km\u00b2 land position.\nClontibret is located in the north east of the 65 kilometre Orlock Bridge gold trend where three targets lie in the 17 kilometre section noted in the above map, the most of advanced of which is Clontibret where a 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) has been defined that remains open in multiple directions including at depth.\nThe Orlock Bridge and Skullmartin trends are hosted within an accretionary prism formed during the oblique collision of the Laurentia and Avalonia tectonic plates and the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. This geological environment comprises Ordovician and Silurian turbidite sequences including greywacke sandstones, conglomerates, siltstones, mudstones, and volcanic units-an established setting globally for significant orogenic gold deposits.\nClontibret - Geological Analogies with Fosterville (+10 Moz)\nThe Clontibret gold target exhibits several key geological features analogous to the high-grade Fosterville Gold Mine in Victoria, Australia (current endowment >10 Moz), indicating the potential for multi-million-ounce gold mineralisation at depth.\nThese analogies include:\nHost Rocks: A folded Ordovician-age turbidite package, comparable to the rock sequence hosting Fosterville's high-grade zones.\nMineralisation Style: At Clontibret gold is intimately associated with acicular arsenopyrite, and to a lesser extent pyrite, similar to the mineralogical style at Fosterville's deposit.\nThe discovery of visible gold in a quartz breccia nearby at Creenkill (with assay values of 123.0 g/t) lends credence to the possibility of high grade gold also being present in the Clontibret target.\nLate-Stage Antimony: Presence of late stibnite/antimony mineralisation, including recent float samples assaying 21.9 g/t Au with 26.4% Sb, indicating a comparable Au-As-Sb mineral system.\nAlteration Envelope: Mineralisation hosted within broad sericite / white mica alteration zones, several metres wide, and around the margins of quartz-carbonate veins.\nMineralisation controlled by brittle faulting\nCollectively, these geological characteristics highlight Clontibret as a highly prospective target with potential for significant high-grade gold mineralisation at depth.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nAbout the \"Discs of Gold\" Project\nConroy Gold's \"Discs of Gold\" project in Ireland is defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100 per cent. held under license by the Company and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit.

The Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest. Gold occurs in multiple styles in the Company\u2019s license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit.\nThere are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nFor

from the Annual Report and Accounts\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI am writing to update you on the progress that your Company is making towards its ambition of delivering a commercially successful and sustainable mine from its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project in Ireland.\nAs I will recount in this letter to you, the 18 months from the beginning of June 2024 (the starting point of FY 25) marked a very consequential period in the history of the Company.\nThe death of the Company\u2019s founder and steadfast steward, Professor Richard Conroy, in October 2024 is the most significant event during this time.\nA full appreciation for Professor Conroy\u2019s contributions to public life across medicine, business and politics was shared in the Company\u2019s annual report for FY 24.\nProfessor Conroy built out the expansive opportunity that is the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project.\nFrom this foundation, your Company is working tirelessly to develop and open a world-class gold mine in Ireland.\nReview of major corporate developments since 1\nst\nJune 2024\nMay 2025 Financial Year\nAgainst the backdrop of limited financial resources, the Company\u2019s geologists initiated a work programme to review and relog 30,000m+ of drill core, including some from a former operator\u2019s work in the 1970s, to extract more comprehensive and consistent information from this valuable library.\nConcurrently with the re-logging effort, the geological team completed all necessary work programmes required for the Company to retain its exploration licenses.\nThe uniformity in geological information gained from the re-logging programme now underpins more robust 3D modelling of the deposit targets and enables use of the latest software tools to maximise opportunities.\nIt also provides a firm base for the Company\u2019s operational team to draw learnings from established world class deposits that have similar mineralisation characteristics to the Company\u2019s exploration targets.\nMore specifically at the Clontibret target, the work evidenced potential structural controls for zones of higher gold mineralization in the deposit at depth, as well as additional target areas for antimony mineralisation.\nThe insights from this work are helping to guide choices and underpin decisions on how the Company best allocates exploration capital in future work programmes.\nAnd finally, the re-logging work boosted active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners for the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project which continue in the current financial year.\nThe Company completed two small fund raisings during the May 2025 Financial Year to help cover its operating cash requirements at a basic level.\nIn October 2024, \u20ac405,928 (\u00a3344,635) was raised via a discounted equity placing at 4.75p/share.\nTowards the end of the financial year in May 2025, the Company raised c. \u20ac240,000 (c.\u00a3203,400) by issuing a 3-year convertible loan note, with a headline conversion price of 10p that represented a material premium to the then prevailing share price of 2.65p.\nNew and existing shareholders participated in the fundraisings, and I thank them for their support of the Company.\nThere were two Director changes during the financial year.\nAs noted earlier, Executive Chairman Professor Richard Conroy passed away in October 2024.\nThe Board of Directors elected me as (Non-Executive) Chairman in November 2024.\nMarian Moroney chose to stand down from the Board in February 2025 following her appointment to a senior leadership position at BHP.\nIn her short time with the Company, Marian had a tremendous impact, bringing her world-class exploration knowledge, rigor, energy, and optimism to us all.\nOn behalf of the Shareholders, Staff, and Board, I express sincere thanks to Marian for her service to the Company.\nCurrent Financial Year ending 31 May 2026\nIn late August 2025, the Company entered into a formal agreement with current and former Directors (or their representatives in the case of a deceased former Director) to restructure amounts owed to them (in excess of \u20ac3.3M) by the Company in respect to accrued fees and other emoluments into success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price.\nThe agreement codifies the participants\u2019 deferral of their legal right to payment, which echoes their long-standing, but voluntary, practice of agreeing to 12-month deferrals as part of the approval of the Company\u2019s annual report and consolidated financial statements.\nThe agreement was, and continues to be, an essential step for attracting new investment in the Company to advance its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project into a successful mine.\nAlthough not required by stock market or legal regulations, certain aspects of the agreement relating to the granting of a net smelter royalty and the proposed issue of share options will be put to a shareholder vote for final approval at next month\u2019s AGM.\nI urge unanimous support for the agreement.\nIn October, the Company completed an oversubscribed private share placement to raise \u20ac1,988,005 (\u00a31,728,700) at 10p per share, representing 24% of the enlarged equity base.\nThe participating investors were primarily long-term, value-oriented investors from North America with significant knowledge of the mining industry.\nThese funds are being used to fund further geological work on the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project (as discussed in more detail below), supporting the work to secure material asset level investment in the project, and for general working capital purposes.\nFurther funding of \u20ac497,987 (\u00a3433,035) came into the Company in October via the exercise of 9.5p per share 12-month warrants that were issued as part of the October 2024 share placing.\nThese fundings and the agreement to restructure the amounts owing to current and former Directors position the Company to decisively advance the \u201cDiscs\u201d project.\nThe geologist team actively prepared the Company for the next phase of in-ground investment in the \u201cDiscs\u201d project, combining the insights gained from the re-logging and deposit modelling effort, with new learnings from the field.\nTaking advantage of drought conditions to access the stream network, the team identified new mineralised gold in outcrop (\u201cMcCully\u2019s Outcrop\u201d) at Corcaskea, which sits 300 metres outside of the Clontibret resource footprint of 0.5M Oz. Au Indicated and Inferred Resource and outside the Preliminary Economic Assessment which confirmed economic and technical viability at a gold price of USD1,372.\nThe knowledge gained from the McCully\u2019s Outcrop suggests a markedly different lode orientation than that seen in the Clontibret deposit and has the potential to upgrade the prospectivity of the Corcaskea area as a potential extension for future growth to the current resource area.\nOn the recently identified Skullmartin gold trend where at the Creenkill Gold Target visible (native) gold from surface quartz breccia samples assaying up to 123.0 g/t Au (4 oz/t), soil sampling work conducted as part of license commitments, yielded five new high priority gold targets for follow-on exploration work and extended the Skullmartin gold trend which now stands at 30km giving the Company over 95km of surface\ngold\nanomalism within the Company\u2019s 1,000km\n2\n, 100% held licences.\nThe discovery of gold across multiple targets demonstrates the diversity of mineralisation styles within the Company\u2019s licence portfolio underlining the district-scale gold potential and potential to depth within the Company\u2019s licence holdings.\nFinally, the geologists supported the executive team in discussions with potential strategic and financial partners, with their help underpinning the September fundraising.\nThe recent fundings are allowing the Company to invigorate pace of its development work on the \u201cDiscs\u201d projects.\nThe initial work program focuses on Clontibret, where drilling is recommencing.\nLater phases of the programme will build out the Company\u2019s understanding of the Clay Lake and Creenkill target areas.\nThe aim of these works is to support the ongoing effort to bring asset level investment in the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project to develop and deliver a successful mine.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Issues\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues are of crucial importance to the Company at all stage of mining, particularly as it moves towards mining development.\nThe Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and integrity in all of its activities and operations including rigorous health and safety compliance, environmental consciousness and the promotion of a culture of good ethical values and behaviour.\nThe Company conducts its business with integrity, honesty and fairness, and requires its partners, contractors and suppliers to meet similar ethical standards.\nIndividual staff members must ensure that they apply and maintain these standards in all their actions.\nAs Chairman of the Board, I am required to regularly monitor and review the Company\u2019s ethical standards and cultural environment and, where necessary, take appropriate action to ensure that proper standards of corporate governance are maintained.\nFurther details are set out in the Directors Report and on the Company\u2019s website (\nwww.conroygold.com\n).\nFinancials for May 2025 Financial Year\nThe loss after taxation from continuing operations for the financial year ended 31 May 2025 was \u20ac633,394 (year ended 31 May 2024: \u20ac585,920).\nAs at 31 May 2025, the Group had cash reserves of \u20ac77,285 (year ended 31 May 2024: \u20ac143,532) and net assets of \u20ac20,526,199 (year ended 31 May 2024: \u20ac20,740,573).\nDirectors and Staff\nI would like to express my deepest appreciation for the support and dedication of the Directors, staff and consultants which has made possible the continued development of the Company during the past year.\nJohn Sherman\nChairman\n25 November 2025\nExtracts from the Directors\u2019 Report\nCorporate governance\nThe Board has adopted the QCA Corporate Governance Code (\u201cQCA Code\u201d), which is derived from the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the Guidance on Board Effectiveness (the \u201cCode\u201d) but adapted to the needs of smaller quoted companies. The Company agrees that good governance contributes to sustainable success and recognises the renewed emphasis on business building trust by forging strong relationships with key stakeholders. The Company understands the importance of a corporate culture that is aligned with the Company\u2019s purpose and business strategy, and which promotes integrity and includes diversity. The Company conducts its business with integrity, honesty and fairness and requires its partners, contractors and suppliers to meet similar ethical standards. The Board is satisfied that its corporate culture and culture of its employees aligns the Company\u2019s objectives, strategy and business model. It is an objective of the Company that all individuals are aware of their responsibilities in applying and maintaining these standards in all their actions. The Board ensures that support is available in the form of staff training and updating its employee handbook such that staff members understand what is expected of them.\nThe Board is aware of the updates to the QCA Code launched in November 2023 for financial years commencing post 1 April 2024 and has applied all relevant updates to these financial statements as required. The Company\u2019s Statement of Compliance with the ten principles of the QCA code and how it has addressed each of these is set out in detail under the section \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d on its website:\nwww.conroygoldandnaturalresources.com/corporate-governance\n.\nExtract from the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nThe following section is extracted from the Independent Auditor's Report but shareholders should read in full the Independent Auditor's Report contained in the Annual Report.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nWe draw attention to note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that during the financial year ended 31 May 2025, the Group and Company incurred losses of \u20ac633,394 and \u20ac605,968 respectively, and, as at that date, the Group and Company had net current liabilities of \u20ac4,027,521 and \u20ac3,583,034 respectively.\nAs stated in note 1, these events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nOur evaluation of the directors\u2019 assessment of the Group and Company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\nobtaining an understanding of the Group and Company\u2019s relevant controls over the preparation of cash flow forecasts and approval of the projections and assumptions used in cash flow forecasts to support the going concern assumption;\nassessing the design and determining the implementation of these relevant controls;\nevaluating directors\u2019 plans and their feasibility by agreeing the inputs used in the cash flow forecast to expenditure commitments and other supporting documentation;\nchallenging the reasonableness of the assumptions applied by the directors in their going concern assessment;\nobtaining confirmations received by the Group and Company from the directors and former directors (as applicable) evidencing that they will not seek repayment of amounts owed to them by the Group and Company within 12 months of the date of approval of the financial statements, unless the Group and/or Company has sufficient funds to repay;\nassessing the mechanical accuracy of the cash flow forecast model; and\nassessing the accuracy and completeness of the relevant disclosures made in the financial statements.\nConsolidated

accounting policies\nReporting entity\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a company domiciled in Ireland. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended 31 May 2025 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the \u201cGroup\u201d). The Company is a public limited company incorporated in Ireland under registration number 232059. The registered office is located at Shannon Airport House, Shannon Free Zone, Shannon, Co. Clare, V14E370, Ireland.\nThe Company is a mineral exploration and development company whose objective is to discover and develop world class ore bodies in order to create value for its shareholders.\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (\u201c\u20ac\u201d). The euro is the functional currency of the Company. The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, where applicable, which are measured at fair value at each reporting date.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Board of Directors and management to use judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Details of critical judgements are disclosed in the accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 25 November 2025.\nStatement of compliance\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2014. The Company\u2019s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101: Reduced Disclosure Framework (\u201cFRS101\u201d) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Conroy Gold and Natural Resources P.L.C. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Group is exposed to or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its control over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Intra-Group balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognises investment in subsidiaries at cost less impairment.\nGoing Concern\nThe Group recorded a loss of \u20ac633,394 (31 May 2024: \u20ac585,920) and the Company recorded a loss of \u20ac605,698 (31 May 2024: \u20ac567,463) for the financial year ended 31 May 2025.

Fitzpatrick, Dr. Sor\u010ba Conroy and the representatives of the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy and his beneficiaries have confirmed that they will not seek repayment of amounts owed to them by the Group and the Company of \u20ac3,460,200 (31 May 2024: \u20ac3,325,822) which are included in net current liabilities, within 12 months of the date of approval of the financial statements, unless the Group and the Company have sufficient funds to repay and subsequent to the year-end entered into a formal agreement with certain of the above Directors and former Directors in this regard as set out in Note 20.\nThe Board of Directors have considered carefully the financial position of the Group and the Company and in that context, have prepared and reviewed cash flow forecasts for the period until 30 November 2026. The Directors have fully considered both current and future capital expenditure commitments and the options to fund such commitments in the twelve month period to 30 November 2026.\nIn doing so, the Directors are mindful of the risks faced by the business including in particular general industry risks facing companies in the natural resource sector.\nThe Board of Directors are experienced at managing the peaks and troughs of investor sentiment in the natural resources industry and will continue to manage the cashflows of the Group and Company including planning/revising work programmes according to available funds.\nThe Group and Company continue to rely on the support of its Directors and also its ability to raise appropriate finance through either asset level investment or fresh issues of share capital to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\nThe support of the Directors and former directors by virtue of the deferral agreement entered into in relation to debts owing to them and the funds raised post year end as set out in Note 20 support the Directors\u2019 assumptions regarding going concern.\nThe Directors recognise that the Group\u2019s net current liabilities of \u20ac4,027,521 of which \u20ac3,460,200 have been deferred as noted above (31 May 2024: \u20ac3,491,763 of which \u20ac3,188,823 was deferred) is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group and the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nIn reviewing the proposed work programme for exploration and evaluation assets, the results obtained from the exploration programme, the funds raised post year end, the write off and deferral of amounts owing to Directors and former Directors post year end, and the prospects for raising additional funds as required, the Board of Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare the Group and the Company financial statements on a going concern basis. The Group consolidated and the Company\u2019s financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying value and classification of assets and liabilities that would arise if the Group and the Company were unable to continue as going concern.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\n(a)\nNew and amended standards adopted by the Group and the Company\nThe Group and the Company have adopted the following amendments to standards for the first time for its annual reporting year commencing 1 June 2024:\nAmendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease liability in a sale and leaseback \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2024; and\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as current or non-current \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2024.\nThe adoption of the above amendments to standards had no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company either due to being not applicable or immaterial.\n(b)\nNew standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group and the Company\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published and endorsed by the EU that are not mandatory for 31 May 2025 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Company.\nThe Board of Directors does not consider that those of the below that will be effective for the year ended 31 May 2026 will have a material effect on the financial statements and they are considering whether or not those that become effective in the following financial year will have any impact on the financial statements.\nAmendments to IAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2025;\nAmendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 17 regarding supplier finance arrangements \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2025;\nAmendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 regarding classification and measurement of financial instruments \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2026;\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards \u2013 Volume 11 \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2026;\nThe following new standards and amendments to standards have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but have not yet been endorsed by the EU, accordingly, none of these standards have been applied in the current year. The Board of Directors is currently assessing whether these standards if endorsed by the EU will have any impact on the financial statements of the Company.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2027;\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2027;\nAmendments to SASB standards regarding enhancement of their international applicability;\n(a)\nIntangible assets\n(i)\nCapitalisation\nAll costs related to acquiring the legal rights to explore will be capitalised in accordance with IFRS 6 criteria. All other costs incurred prior to acquiring the rights to explore are charged directly to the consolidated profit and loss account. Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure incurred on exploring, and testing exploration prospects are accumulated and capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation (\u201cE&E\u201d) assets.\nE&E capitalised costs include geological and geophysical costs, and other direct costs of exploration (drilling, trenching, sampling and technical feasibility and commercial viability activities). In addition, E&E capitalised costs include an allocation from operating expenses.\nAll such costs are necessary for exploration and evaluation activities. E&E capitalised costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.\nAt completion of appraisal activities if technical feasibility is demonstrated and commercial resources are discovered, then the carrying amount of the relevant E&E asset will be reclassified as a development and production asset, once the carrying value of the asset has been assessed for impairment. If following completion of appraisal activities in an area, it is not possible to determine\ntechnical feasibility and commercial viability, or if the right to explore expires\n, then the costs of such unsuccessful exploration and evaluation is written off to the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which the event occurred.\n(ii)\nImpairment\nIf facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment review is performed. The following are considered to be key indicators of impairment\nin relation to E&E assets:\nThe period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired or will expire in the near future and is not expected to be renewed.\nSubstantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned.\nExploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area has not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area.\nSufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.\nFor E&E assets, where the above indicators exist at the balance sheet date on an annual basis, an impairment test is carried out. The E&E assets are categorised into Cash Generating Units (\u2018\u2019CGU\u2019\u2019) on a country-by-country (where material) basis for the years ended 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024. The carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount and any resulting impairment loss is written off to the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The recoverable amount of the CGU is assessed as the higher of its fair value, less costs to sell, and its value in use.\n(b)\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group\u2019s statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are initially measured at fair value.\nTransaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities as appropriate, on initial recognition.\nTransaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nSubsequent measurement of financial assets\nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost unless held within a different business model other than the \u2018hold to collect\u2019 or \u2018hold to collect and sell\u2019 in which case they are categorised at fair value through profit or loss (\u201cFVTPL\u201d). Further, irrespective of the business model used, financial assets whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest are accounted for at fair value though profit or loss. All derivative instruments fall into this category, except for those designated and effective as hedging instruments, for which the hedge accounting requirements apply. No adjustment has been made to the carrying value of the convertible loan on the basis that any move in foreign exchange rate was immaterial and the fair value of the loan remains the contractual value of the cash flows associated with the loan.\nThe category also contains an equity instrument. The Group accounts for the investment at fair value through profit or loss and did not make the irrevocable election to account for the investment in Karelian Diamond Resources PLC and listed equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income. The fair value was determined in line with the requirements of IFRS 13 \u2018Fair Value Measurement\u2019. Assets in this category are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss.\nTrade and other receivables are measured at their transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade and other payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost.\nSubsequent measurement of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This method calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates the interest expense over the relevant period.\nThe effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period to the amortised cost of a financial liability.\nThe Net Smelter Royalty liability is a fixed euro financial liability instrument linked to production of gold from the Group\u2019s licences which form part of the Group\u2019s intangible assets. This was measured at fair value at the date of cashflows from a producing mine together with an appropriate discount rate.\nIt was reviewed at 31 May 2025 using the effective interest method and will be reviewed annually on this basis.\n(c)\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nMotor vehicles\n5 years\nPlant and office equipment\n10 years\n(d)\nIncome taxation expense\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n(e)\nWarrants and share-based payments\nThe Group classifies instruments issued as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments. When the warrants issued (see Note 18 for details) have an exercise price in sterling, they are derivative in nature and are liability classified. They do not qualify for equity classification as any cash settlement on exercise of these warrants will be received in a foreign currency. Where warrants are issued in the functional currency of the parent company and meet the other necessary conditions, they are recognised as equity instruments. The warrant liabilities are recognised at their fair value on initial recognition and subsequently are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Any costs associated with the issuance of warrants are taken as an immediate charge or credit through the statement of profit or loss. See Note 13 for further details.\nFor equity-settled share-based payment transactions (i.e. the granting of share options and certain share warrants), the Group measures the services and the corresponding increase in equity at fair value at the measurement date (which is the grant date). In both instances a recognised valuation methodology for the pricing of financial instruments is used (Binomial Lattice Model or Black Scholes Model).\n(f)\nEarnings per share\nThe Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.\n(g)\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n(h)\nPension costs\nThe Group provides for pensions for certain employees through a defined contribution pension scheme. The amounts are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Any difference between amounts charged and contributions paid to the pension scheme is included in receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n(i)\nForeign currencies\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies relating to costs and non-monetary assets are translated into \u20ac at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates on which the transactions occurred. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into \u20ac at the rate of exchange ruling at the consolidated statement of financial position date. The resulting profits or losses are dealt with in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n(j)\nLoans\nDirectors\u2019 loans are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability.\nAs the convertible loans are made up of both equity and liability components, they are considered to be compound financial instruments. At initial recognition, the carrying amount of a compound financial instrument is allocated to its equity and liability components. When the initial carrying amount is allocated, the equity component is assigned the residual amount after deducting from the fair value of the instrument as a whole the amount separately determined for the liability component. The fair value of the conversion feature is taken directly to equity. The fair value of the liability, which is the difference between the transaction price and the fair value of the conversion feature, is recognised as a liability in the consolidated statement of financial position. The liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Company accounts for the interest expense on the liability component of the convertible loan notes at the effective interest rate. The difference between the effective interest rate and interest rate attached to the convertible loan increases the carrying amount of the liability so that, on maturity, the carrying amount is equal to the capital cash repayment that the Company may be required to pay.\n(k)\nOrdinary shares\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from retained earnings, net of any tax effects. Where warrants are issued for the sole purpose of assisting with an issue of equity or to meet broker transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of equity, the amount initially recognised, that is their fair value, is deducted from share premium.\nSubsequently, where the warrants qualify as equity they are recognised in other reserves and the amount recognised is not changed.\nIf the warrants qualify as a liability the fair value is trued up from one reporting period to the next through profit or loss.\n(l)\nImpairment \u2013 financial assets measured at amortised cost\nFinancial assets measured at amortised cost are reviewed for impairment loss at each reporting date.\nThe Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d) as required under a simplified approach for receivables that do not contain a financing component. The Company\u2019s approach to ECL reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Significant financial difficulties of the counterparty, probability that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation and default in payments are all considered indicators for increases in credit risks. If the credit risk increases to the point that it is considered to be credit impaired, interest income will be calculated based on the gross carrying amount adjusted for the loss allowance. Any contractual payment which is more than 90 days past due is considered credit impaired.\n(m)\nSignificant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nSignificant judgements in applying the Company\u2019s accounting policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Board of Directors to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Board of Directors evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. The Board of Directors bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and on other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of the reported amounts that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In the process of applying the Group\u2019s accounting policies above, the Board of Directors have identified the judgemental areas that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements (apart from those involving estimations), which are dealt with as follows:\nExploration and evaluation assets\nThe assessment of whether general administration costs and salary costs are capitalised exploration and evaluation costs or expensed involves judgement. The Board of Directors consider the nature of each cost incurred and whether it is deemed appropriate to capitalise it within exploration and evaluation assets. Given that the activity of management and the resultant administration and salary costs are primarily focused on the Group\u2019s gold prospects, the Board of Directors consider it appropriate to capitalise a portion of such costs. These costs are reviewed on a line-by-line basis with the resultant calculation of the amount to be capitalised being specific to the activities of the Company in any given year.\nGoing concern\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires an assessment on the validity of the going concern assumption. The validity of the going concern assumption is dependent on the successful further development and ultimate production of the mineral resources and the availability of sufficient finance to bring the resources to economic maturity and profitability. The Directors recognise that these matters are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Board of Directors, having reviewed the proposed programme for exploration and evaluation assets, the results from the exploration programme and the prospects for raising additional funds as required, are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.\nRefer to pages 35 and 36 for further details.\nCash Generating Units (\u2018\u2019CGUs\u2019\u2019)\nAs outlined in the Intangible assets accounting policy, the exploration and evaluation assets should be allocated to CGUs. The determination of what constitutes a CGU requires judgement. The Board of Directors consider that the licences held by the Group and Company in the Longford-Down Massif on the island of Ireland represent one CGU and its licence in Finland is a separate CGU.\nThe carrying value of each CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the CGU is assessed as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The determination of value in use requires the following judgements:\nEstimation of future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset;\nExpectation about possible variations in the amount or timing of the future cash flows; and\nThe determination of an appropriate discount rate.\nDeferred tax\nNo deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses as it is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the related temporary differences can be utilised.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Board of Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the consolidated statement of financial position date and the amounts reported during the financial year. The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. While uncertainty exists, primarily due to the nature of the mining and exploration business, this assessment includes a review of the possible outcomes that can be reasonably expected in the forthcoming financial period.\nExploration and evaluation assets\nThe carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets in the consolidated statement of financial position was\n\u20ac\n29,059,463 (31 May 2024: \u20ac28,405,738) at 31 May 2025 (Note 8). The Board of Directors carried out an assessment, in accordance with IFRS 6:\nExploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\nrelating to likelihood of licence renewal, likelihood of further expenditure, possible discontinuation of activities over specific claims and available data which may suggest that the recoverable value of an exploration and evaluation asset is less than its carrying amount. This assessment included an assessment of the likelihood of securing a future strategic investment or joint venture partner to assist with the development of the assets.\nBased on this assessment the Board of Directors is satisfied as to the carrying value of these assets and is satisfied that these are recoverable, acknowledging however that their recoverability is dependent on future successful exploration efforts.\nEmployee benefits - Share-based payment transactions\nThe Company had equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with non-market performance conditions which fall within the scope of and are accounted for under the provisions of IFRS 2:\nShare-based Payment\n. Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the options under these schemes is recognised as an operating expense with a corresponding increase in the \u201cShare-based payment reserve\u201d, within equity, where the exercise price is granted in EUR or recognised as a liability where a different currency is quoted as the exercise price over the vesting period. The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Company has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options granted and the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Company is the Black Scholes Model. The fair value of these options is measured using an appropriate option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.\n(n)\nSegmental reporting\nOperating segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group\u2019s geographical segments which represent the financial basis by which the Group manages its business. The Group has one class of business, Gold Exploration. The Group has two principal reportable segments as follows:\nIrish exploration assets: gold exploration assets in Ireland; and\nFinnish exploration assets: gold exploration assets in Finland.\nGroup assets and liabilities include cash resources held by the Group. Corporate expenses include other operational expenditure incurred by the Group. These are not within the definition of an operating segment. Performance is measured based on segment result and total asset value as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group\u2019s Board of Directors. There are no significant inter segment transactions. Costs that are directly attributable to Ireland and Finland have been capitalised to exploration and evaluation assets as appropriate (Note 8). The Group did not earn any revenue in the current or comparative financial year.\n(o)\nLeased assets\nThe Group makes the use of leasing arrangements principally for the provision of motor vehicles.\nLease terms for motor vehicles have lease terms of between 6 months and 6 years without any extension terms. The Group does not enter into sale and leaseback arrangements. All the leases are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide variety of different terms and conditions such as purchase options and escalation clauses. The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. A lease conveys the right to direct the use and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nMeasurement and recognition of leases as a lessee\nAt lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in its consolidated statement of financial position. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received). The Group depreciates the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.\nAt the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate.\nSubsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced by lease payments that are allocated between repayments of principal and finance costs. The finance cost is the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is reassessed when there is a change in the lease payments.\n2\nOperating expenses\n2025\n2024\n(a)\nAnalysis of operating expenses\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nOperating expenses\n1,040,690\n877,912\nTransfer to intangible assets\n(509,888)\n(196,408)\n530,802\n681,504\nOperating expenses are analysed as follows:\nWages, salaries and related costs\n665,973\n456,379\nProfessional fees\n188,164\n249,986\nOther operating expenses\n126,632\n113,127\nAuditor\u2019s remuneration\n41,500\n40,000\nDepreciation\n18,421\n18,420\n1,040,690\n877,912\nOther operating costs include items such as insurance, printing, stationery and office expenditure.\nOf the above costs, a total of\n\u20ac509,888\n(31 May 2024: \u20ac196,408) is capitalised to intangible assets based on a review of the nature and quantum of the underlying costs. The costs capitalised to intangible assets mainly relate to salaries of geological and on-site staff together with an appropriate portion of executive management salaries. \u20ac145,879 (31 May 2024: \u20ac201,162) is charged to the Statement of profit or loss in relation to executive management salaries.\n2025\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n(b)\nWages, salaries and related costs as disclosed above is analysed as follows:\nThe following amounts has been charged to Profit and Loss account:\nWages and salaries\n636,466\n450,374\nSocial insurance costs\n29,507\n6,005\n665,973\n456,379\nCapitalised as intangible assets\n457,004\n192,411\nCharged to profit and loss\n208,969\n263,968\n665,973\n456,379\nThe average number of persons employed during the financial year (including executive Directors) by activity was as follows:\n2025\n2024\nExploration and evaluation\n6\n6\nCorporate management and administration\n2\n2\n8\n8\nThe Group has an externally funded defined contribution scheme in order to satisfy the pension arrangements in respect of certain management personnel. No pension contribution costs or share based payments have been incurred over the past number of years.\nAccrued amounts of salary and pension owing to current and former directors are set out in note 13.\nIt is anticipated that the Company will move towards incorporating share based payments as part of overall remuneration in future years.\nAn analysis of remuneration for each Director of the Company in the current financial year (prior to amounts transferred to intangible assets) is as follows:\nFees\n\u20ac\nSalary\n\u20ac\nTotal\n\u20ac\nProfessor Richard Conroy\n8,333\n67,219\n75,552\nMaureen T.A.

They are subject to impairment assessment whenever indicators of impairment exist, considering factors such as the remaining terms of licences or claims, the likelihood of licence renewal, the probability of further exploration or evaluation expenditure, the potential discontinuation of exploration activities on specific claims, and any available data indicating that the recoverable amount of the asset may be less than its carrying amount.\nThe Irish licenses in relation to Clontibret, Longford Down and Armagh were transferred in 2022 to the first three subsidiaries as set out in Note 7. All prior costs capitalised in line with IFRS 6 as above, in relation to these three licenses, were transferred to the subsidiaries where the licenses are now held. Costs incurred in the current year in relation to the licenses held by these companies either were or will be recharged to the subsidiaries.\nIn assessing for impairment the Board of Directors have considered in particular the proposed work programmes for the underlying mineral resources in both Ireland and Finland and their likelihood of adding to the existing resource and resource potential in their licence areas.\nThey have also assessed the likelihood of securing a future strategic investment or joint venture partner to assist with the development of the assets.\nThey are satisfied that there are no indications of impairment and this confidence is underpinned by the strength of the gold price which was in excess of $4,000 (c. \u20ac3,500) per ounce in October 2025.\nThe Board of Directors note that the realisation of the intangible assets is dependent on further successful development and ultimate production of the mineral resources and the availability of sufficient finance to bring the resources to economic maturity and profitability.

However, as these amounts are receivable from the Group companies, the Directors are confident that the probability of default is negligible.\nKarelian Diamond Resources P.L.C. (\u201cKarelian\u201d) is not a group company however the Company holds a 2.545% interest in Karelian and it is also considered related due to common directors, registered office, the sharing of personnel and office facilities. Due to this relationship, expenses are shared and allocated to one another and payment of these is through an intercompany account.\nOther related companies are as set out in Note 17 (f).\nBecause of the interrelationship of the Group with Karelian in terms of shared costs and the cross-over of relationship between the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy, and the other related companies, the Directors consider that the probability of default is negligible.\n11\nFinancial assets\nGroup and Company\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nEquity investment\n34,012\n143,943\nConvertible loan\n142,506\n136,026\n176,518\n279,969\nIn May 2023, the Group reached an agreement whereby it converted an amount equivalent to \u20ac143,943 (\u00a3125,000) (of amounts owing by Karelian into 5,000,000 new ordinary shares of \u20ac0.00025 each in the capital of Karelian at a price of 2.5p per share. The quoted share price of Karelian was 0.585p per share at 31 May 2025 (2024:\n2.7p).\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s shareholding in Karelian was therefore revised downwards to \u20ac34,012 with the resultant decrease in fair value of \u20ac109,931 recognised as a loss in the statement of profit or loss.\nAs part of the same transaction a further amount outstanding equivalent to \u00a3112,500 was incorporated into a convertible loan note (\u201cthe Loan Note\u201d) with a term of 18 months attracting an interest rate of 5% per annum, payable on the redemption or conversion of the Loan Note.\nThe Loan Note can be converted at the option of the Company at a price equivalent to 5p per Share.\nThe Group is in discussions to extend the term of this Loan Note.\nInterest income of \u20ac6,481 (2024: \u20ac6,481) was earned on the financial asset during the year.\n12\nCash and cash equivalents\nGroup\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash held in bank accounts\n77,285\n143,532\n77,285\n143,532\nCompany\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash held in bank accounts\n75,295\n55,943\n75,295\n55,943\n13\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\nGroup\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nAmounts falling due within one year:\nOther creditors and accruals\n648,800\n660,627\nAccrued Directors\u2019 remuneration\nFees and other emoluments\n1,256,937\n2,617,549\nPension contributions\n164,675\n164,675\nAccrued former Directors\u2019 remuneration\nFees and other emoluments\n2,082,156\n443,022\n4,152,568\n3,885,873\nCompany\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nAmounts falling due within one year:\nOther creditors and accruals\n341,376\n336,219\nAmounts owing to subsidiary companies\n378,216\n381,725\nAccrued Directors\u2019 remuneration\nFees and other emoluments\n1,256,937\n2,617,549\nPension contributions\n164,675\n164,675\nAccrued former Directors\u2019 remuneration\nFees and other emoluments\n2,082,156\n443,022\n4,223,360\n3,943,190\nIt is the Group\u2019s practice to agree terms of transactions, including payment terms with suppliers.

Amounts invested by Demir Export were treated as a non-controlling interest in each year from financial year ending 31 May 2022.\nOn 29 April 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement with Demir Export that resulted in Demir Export exiting the joint venture.\nDemir Export had continued to spend on the project in the current financial year and at the time of their exit, had invested a total of \u20ac5,657,671 in the subsidiary companies covered by the joint venture which was accounted for as a non-controlling interest.\nAs a result of the joint venture exit, Demir transferred all convertible shares to the Company with the consideration being the granting by the Company of a net smelter royalty interest payable from future production.\nThe net smelter royalty is calculated at a rate of 2% payable from commercial production of minerals from the joint venture licences.\nThe royalty payment will be made from the first mine or mines that are brought into production however the total payment under the net smelter royalty is capped at the total amount invested by Demir Export of \u20ac5,657,671.\nThis transaction was treated as an asset acquisition under IFRS 3 with the value of the intangible assets acquired being equal to the investment into the subsidiary companies by Demir Export of \u20ac5,657,671 and the consideration paid being the granting of the Net Smelter Royalty to Demir Export which is capped at the amount of the investment.\nThis liability is carried as a non-current liability under other creditors as it will only become payable when a fully permitted mine is brought into production in one or more of the Group\u2019s licences.\nAn obligation has been recognised given that it is considered probable by the Directors that one of the groups exploration and evaluation assets will be commercially developed.\nThe fair value of the Net Smelter Royalty Liability as at 29 April 2024 (being the date of the transaction) was calculated at \u20ac4,501,410 in accordance with the Group\u2019s accounting policies as set out in Note 1.\nThe resultant difference between this and the value of the non-controlling interest of \u20ac5,657,671 resulted in a gain of \u20ac1,156,261 being recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity and recorded as an increase in other reserves on the Group\u2019s Statement of Financial Position in the consolidated financial statements to 31 May 2024 in accordance with IFRS 10.\nThe fair value of the liability was considered at both 31 May 2024 and 31 May 2025 in the context of any potential changes in underlying assumptions and no amendment made as any relevant changes were immaterial.\n15\nCalled up share capital and share premium \u2013 Group and Company\nAuthorised:\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n11,995,569,057 ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each\n11,995,569\n11,995,569\n306,779,844 deferred shares of \u20ac0.02 each\n6,135,597\n6,135,597\n437,320,727 deferred shares of \u20ac0.00999 each\n4,368,834\n4,368,834\n22,500,000\n22,500,000\nThe deferred shares do not entitle the holder to receive a dividend or other distribution.

The loans do not incur interest, are not secured and will not be called upon within twelve months from the date of signing of these consolidated financial statements unless the company is in a position to pay.\n(b)\nFor the financial year ended 31 May 2025, the Company incurred costs totalling \u20ac52,702 (31 May 2024: \u20ac115,048) on behalf of Karelian Diamond Resources P.L.C., which has certain common shareholders and Directors. These costs were recharged to Karelian Diamond Resources P.L.C. This intercompany account does not incur interest and no final settlement of the balance has been agreed.

Maureen T.A. Jones is a Director of Trans-International Oil Exploration Limited. The Estate of Professor Richard Conroy holds 50.7% of the share capital of this company. A further \u20ac47,535 (31 May 2024: \u20ac47,535) is owed by Conroy P.L.C., a company in which the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy has a controlling interest. Amounts totalling \u20ac3,076 (31 May 2024: \u20ac3,076) were owed by companies in which the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy and Maureen T.A. Jones hold a 50% interest each. The amounts owed by the various companies are included within \u201cOther receivables\u201d in the current and previous financial year\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position and company\u2019s statement of financial position.\n(g)\nAt 31 May 2025, the Company owed \u20ac10,398 to (31 May 2024: \u20ac25,094 was owed by) Conroy Gold (Clontibret) Limited, \u20ac36,389 to (31 May 2024: \u20ac10,793 was owed by) Conroy Gold (Longford-Down) Limited and it owed \u20ac331,429 to (31 May 2022: \u20ac381,725) Conroy Gold (Armagh) Limited.

The determination of the fair value of the warrants on the date of grant using the Black Scholes Model is affected by the Company\u2019s share price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables. These variables include the expected term of the warrants, the share price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividends.\nThe following key input assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of the sterling based warrants:\n31 May\n2025\n9 October\n2024\n31 May\n2024\n23 June\n2023\nWarrants\nWarrants\nWarrants\nWarrants\nDividend yield\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nShare price volatility\n100.95%\n43%\n46.49%\n43.00%\nRisk free interest rate\n4.15%\n4.72%\n4.72%\n4.72%\nExpected life (in years)\n0.5 - 1 years\n1 year\n2 years\n3 years\n19\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial risk management objectives, policies and processes\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n(a)\nInflation;\n(b)\nInterest rate risk;\n(c)\nForeign currency risk;\n(d)\nLiquidity risk; and\n(e)\nCredit risk.\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group\u2019s risk management framework.\nThe Group\u2019s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group\u2019s activities. The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group\u2019s risk management policies and procedures and framework in relation to the risks faced.\n(a)\nInflation\nThe Group is exposed to the risk associated with inflation such as the impact of increased operating expenses including rent, light and heat and wages and salaries. The Chairman and Managing Director monitor costs on an ongoing basis.\n(b)\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group currently finances its operations through shareholders\u2019 funds. Short term cash funds are invested, if appropriate, in short-term interest-bearing bank deposits. There were no short-term interest-bearing bank deposits at 31 May 2025 or 31 May 2024 and no sensitivity analysis has been performed. The Group did not enter into any hedging transactions with respect to interest rate risk.\n(c)\nForeign currency risk\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk on purchases, loans and bank deposits that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entities of the Group.\nIt is Group policy to ensure that foreign currency risk is managed wherever possible by matching foreign currency income and expenditure. During the financial years ended 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024, the Group did not utilise foreign currency forward contracts or other derivatives to manage foreign currency risk.\nThe Group\u2019s foreign currency risk exposure in respect of the principal foreign currencies in which the Group operates was as follows at 31 May 2025:\nSterling exposure\nEuro exposure\nTotal\ndenominated in \u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash and cash equivalents\n108\n77,177\n77,285\nTrade and other payables\n(68,345)\n(4,084,223)\n(4,152,568)\nOther receivables and Vat receivable\n-\n111,959\n111,959\nAmount owed by Karelian Diamond Resources P.L.C\n-\n75,065\n75,065\nRelated party loans\n-\n(139,263)\n(139,263)\nConvertible Loan\n(240,179)\n-\n(240,179)\nTotal exposure\n(308,416)\n(3,959,285)\n(4,267,701)\nThe Group\u2019s foreign currency risk exposure in respect of the principal foreign currencies in which the Group operates was as follows at 31 May 2024:\nSterling exposure\nEuro exposure\nTotal\ndenominated in \u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash and cash equivalents\n695\n142,837\n143,532\nTrade and other payables\n(111,586)\n(3,774,287)\n(3,885,873)\nOther receivables\n-\n243,026\n243,026\nAmount owed by Karelian Diamond Resources P.L.C\n-\n144,551\n144,551\nRelated party loans\n-\n(136,999)\n(136,999)\nTotal exposure\n(110,891)\n(3,380,872)\n(3,491,763)\nThe following are the significant exchange rates that applied against \u20ac1 during the financial year:\nAverage rate 2025\nAverage rate 2024\nSpot rate\n31 May\n2025\nSpot rate\n31 May\n2024\nGBP\n0.840\n0.860\n0.841\n0.851\nSensitivity analysis\nA 10% strengthening of Euro against Sterling, based on outstanding financial assets and liabilities at 31 May 2025 would have decreased the reported loss by \u20ac30,842 (31 May 2024: \u20ac11,089) as a consequence of the retranslation of foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities at those dates. A weakening of 10% of the Euro against Sterling would have had an equal and opposite effect. It is assumed that all other variables, especially interest rates, remain constant in the analysis.\n(d)\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and adverse conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group\u2019s reputation.\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by regularly monitoring cash flow projections. The nature of the Group\u2019s exploration and appraisal activities can result in significant differences between expected and actual cash flows.\nContractual maturities of financial liabilities as at 31 May 2025 were as follows:\nItem\nCarrying amount \u20ac\nContractual cash flows \u20ac\n6 months or less \u20ac\n6 -12 months \u20ac\n1-2 years\n\u20ac\n2-5 years\n\u20ac\nTrade and other payables (including related party loans)\n4,291,832\n4,291,832\n624,337\n207,295\n3,460,200\n-\nConvertible Loan\n216,208\n240,180\n-\n-\n-\n240,180\n4,508,040\n4,532,012\n624,337\n207,295\n3,460,200\n240,180\nContractual maturities of financial liabilities as at 31 May 2024 were as follows:\nItem\nCarrying amount \u20ac\nContractual cash flows \u20ac\n6 months or less \u20ac\n6 -12 months \u20ac\n1-2 years\n\u20ac\n2-5 years\n\u20ac\nTrade and other payables (including related party loans)\n4,034,318\n4,034,318\n610,210\n235,285\n3,188,823\n-\n4,034,318\n4,034,318\n610,210\n235,285\n3,188,823\n-\n\\* The amount of \u20ac624,337 (31 May 2024: \u20ac610,210) relates to trade creditors and accruals.\n*\\* The Directors, namely Maureen T.A. Jones, Professor Garth Earls, Brendan McMorrow, Howard Bird, John Sherman and former Directors, namely, James P. Jones, S\u00e9amus P. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Sor\u010ba Conroy and representatives of the Estate of Professor Richard Conroy and his beneficiaries have confirmed that they will not seek repayment of amounts owed to them by the Group and the Company of \u20ac3,460,200 (31 May 2024: \u20ac3,188,823) within 12 months of the date of approval of the financial statements, unless the Group has sufficient funds to repay.\nThe Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac77,285 at 31 May 2025 (31 May 2024: \u20ac143,532).\n(e) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge its obligation.\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a cash deposit, amount owed by related party and other receivables is not recovered. Group deposits are placed only with banks with appropriate credit ratings.\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024 was:\n31 May\n2025\n31 May\n2024\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash and cash equivalents\n77,285\n143,532\nAmount owed by Karelian Diamond Resources Plc\n75,065\n144,551\nConvertible Loan (Note 11)\n142,506\n136,026\nOther receivables (Note 10)\n68,715\n64,226\n363,571\n488,335\nThe Group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are held at AIB Bank which has a credit rating of \u201cBBB+\u201d (31 May 2024: BBB+) as determined by Standard & Poor's Credit Rating, and Bank of Ireland which has a short term credit rating of \u201cF2\u2019\u2019 (31 May 2024: F2) as\ndetermined by Standard & Poor's Credit Rating.\nExpected credit loss\nThe Group measures credit risk and expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost using probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default. Management consider both historical analysis and forward-looking information in determining any expected credit loss. At 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024, all cash is accessible on demand and held with counterparties with a credit rating of BBB+ or higher. Having considered the credit rating of the counterparties and the outstanding balances, management have determined that for both financial years presented, the amount of ECL is immaterial.\nThe receivables relate to amounts receivable from Group/related companies (as set out in Note 10). The directors are confident that the probability of any default in relation to these items is so low that they have calculated the amount of any related ECL to be immaterial.\n(f)\nFair values versus carrying amounts\nDue to the short-term nature of the Group\u2019s current financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost at 31 May 2025 and 31 May 2024,\nthe fair value equals the carrying amount\nin each case. The carrying value of non-current\nfinancial assets and liabilities has been considered by the Board and is not materially different to their fair value.\n(g) Capital management\nThe Group\u2019s objective is to discover and develop world class ore bodies in order to create value for its shareholders. The Group\u2019s strategy is to explore in politically stable and geographically attractive countries such as Ireland and Finland. The Group ensures as far as possible to obtain adequate working capital to carry out its work obligations and commitments.\nThe Group\u2019s overall strategy remains unchanged from the prior period.\nThe Group has historically funded its activities through share issues and placings and loans.
