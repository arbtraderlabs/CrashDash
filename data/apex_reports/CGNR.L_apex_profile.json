Details of these can be found below and a full copy of the interim results statement can be viewed on the Company\u2019s website.\nHighlights:\nRestructuring completed in relation to amounts owing to Directors and former Directors in excess of \u20ac3.3 million including a write off of \u20ac680,000 with the balance being deferred and ultimately repayable from success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price.\nOversubscribed private placement at 10.0p raising approximately \u20ac2.0 million (\u00a31.7 million) with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5 million (\u00a30.4 million) from the exercise of warrants during the period.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at Clontibret covering ca 2,000 metres commenced in November with the planned holes aiming to follow on the gold and antimony plunge trends at Clontibret identified during the detailed relogging project.\nNet assets of the group were \u20ac22,407,969 as at 30 November 2025 and the group made a profit for the six-month period of \u20ac278,636 after the effects of the debt write off.\nJohn Sherman, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe balance sheet repair delivered during the reporting period, including fundraisings involving both new and existing shareholders, is allowing the Company to purposefully advance its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at the Clontibret gold deposit commenced at the end of the reporting period; the work aims to assess the potential for higher-grade structurally controlled gold mineralization at depth to expand the deposit, as well as testing the antimony-bearing lode system for its potential contribution to project economics.\nI look forward to seeing the initial results of this work by the end of the current calendar quarter.\"\nAbout the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d Project\nConroy Gold\u2019s \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project in Ireland is defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100% held under license by the Company, and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit.\nThe Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions.\nThe Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest.\nGold occurs in multiple styles in the Company\u2019s license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit. There are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs\u201d targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel: +353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel: +44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-203-764 2341\nTel: +44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel: +353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\nChairman\u2019s statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI present your Company\u2019s Half-Yearly Report and Condensed Financial Statements for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025.\nThe critical action for the Company in the period was the repair to its balance sheet through two steps as follows:\n1) in late August 2025 when the share price was 5.3p, the Company entered into an agreement with certain current and former directors (\u201cthe Participants\u201d) to restructure amounts owed to them (in excess of \u20ac3.3M) into success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price; and 2) in October 2025, the Company closed an\noversubscribed private placement at 10p raising \u20ac2.0M (c. \u00a31.7M), with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5M (c. \u00a30.4M) coming from the exercise of 12-month warrants at 9.5p issued as part of the Company\u2019s October 2024 fundraising.\nFurther details on these two steps are in my letter sent to shareholders dated 26 November 2025 along with the Company\u2019s Annual Report for 2025.\nTo close my comments on this action, I was pleased to see shareholders vote at the AGM in December to approve the August agreement with near unanimity, allowing the Company to have a clear focus on the futur"

These three gold zones include 2 metres at 2.1 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au), 1.5 metres at 3.2 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au) and 0.5 metre at 0.8 g/t Au. The first gold mineralisation was intersected at a relatively shallow down hole depth of 27.5 metres.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two style of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork. The assay results reported on today relate to the lode style mineralisation.\nThe stockwork resource also contributes to the overall contained ounces. Three previous drill holes totalling 1,053 metres in a step out drilling programme have also demonstrated, through intersections of gold in the stockwork, that the Clontibret gold deposit extends 375 metres to the north-east (announced by the Company on 18 January 2023).\nThe lode gold zone intersections between the Clontibret gold resource and the Corcaskea gold target, which were reported in the assay results from this drill hole, open up the surrounding area for further step out drilling and the probability of linking the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret resource area which are 535 metres apart.\nThe drill hole was drilled to a down hole depth of 268.5 metres at a -60 degree angle and drilled to the east (Azimuth 090).\nDrill Hole Intersections:\n\u2022\n2.0m\n@ 2.1 g/t Au from\n27.5m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au from\n28.5m\n\u2022\n1.5m\n@ 3.2 g/t Au from\n40.0m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au from\n41.0m\n\u2022\n0.5m\n@ 0.8 g/t Au from\n88.5m\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented)\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe Board believes that these results provide further evidence of the continuity between the Clontibret gold target and the Corcaskea area, where excellent gold intersections have been recorded in trenching, including 16.5 metres at 6.5 g/t gold, and 12 metres at 4.9 g/t gold.\nThe results are also a further indication of the overall gold potential of the 65 km gold trend which the Company has discovered. Many other gold targets have been identified along the trend including, for example, the Clay Lake gold target, which has a far larger gold-in-soil target footprint than Clontibret.\nIn addition to Clontibret, the Board looks forward to demonstrating the overall potential of the gold trend, on which in the north-eastern segment alone, we have a gold exploration target of 8.8 million ounces in addition to the JORC resource of 517,000 oz gold.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377"

The programme is being carried out in association with the Company\u2019s joint venture partner, Demir Export A.?.\nThe Clay Lake gold target in\nCounty Armagh\nis one of a series of targets discovered by the Company along the 65 km (45 Mile) gold trend. A JORC resource of 517,000oz/Au has been estimated on a small part of the Clontibret gold deposit in\nCounty Monaghan\n(previously announced by the Company on\n28 July 2017\n).\nThe step out drilling programme at the Clay Lake gold target forms part of an overall assessment of the gold and base metal potential of the joint venture area. Eight holes on the Derryhennet section of the Clay Lake gold target, totalling approximately\n2,000m\n, are planned initially. Drilling is also planned in due course on other targets along the gold trend.\nThe overall Clay Lake gold target forms a single large gold-in-soil anomaly, over 200 Ha (c.500 acres) in area and is nearly 3km in length, which in places is 2km wide (as previously announced by the Company on\n28 January 2016\n). This is a much larger gold-in-soil footprint than at the Clontibret gold target. The drilling programme at Clay Lake will step out from the known gold mineralisation, where previous trenching and drilling has yielded trenching results of up to\n5m\nat 3.0g/t gold and, drilling, a continuous gold intersection of\n100m\nat 0.6g/t gold (including\n11.8m\nat 1.4g/t Au).\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cI am delighted to see drilling at the Clay Lake gold target. The initial drilling programme at Clay Lake forms part of the overall assessment of the gold trend which the Company has discovered. We are, of course, looking at an entire new gold district which contains many gold targets along the trend, including the Clontibret gold deposit, where results have been excellent including the recent drilling that demonstrated the continuity between that deposit and the Corcaskea gold target.\nI would also like to refer interested parties to the Company website where there is a map showing the location of the trend and the areas that have been identified, giving a picture of its potential and the work being undertaken.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com"

The exploration programme is being carried out in conjunction with the Company\u2019s joint venture partner, Demir Export A.?.\nThe discovery was made during prospecting over the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Newtownhamilton) option area in\nCounty Armagh\nin\nNorthern Ireland\n. The discovery location is south of the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Keady) option area, which contains the Company\u2019s\nClay Lake\ngold discovery.\nVisible gold was observed at two locations within the new discovery area.\nAssay results, from five quartz samples, located on or close to the surface, returned values of 123.0 g/t Au, 76.7 g/t Au, 44.1 g/t Au, 35.2 g/t Au and 12.8 g/t Au, respectively. The assay results of 123.0 g/t Au, 76.7 g/t Au and 44.1 g/t Au are the highest gold assay results returned since the Company began exploration in the Longford\u2013Down Massif. All samples were analysed by ALS (OMAC Laboratories), Loughrea, using 30g fire assay fusion with gravimetric finish (method code Au-GRA21).\nA trenching and drilling programme is planned to follow up on the discovery and to enable the Company to better assess and understand the mineralisation in the area.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThis new discovery is potentially a transformational event for gold exploration and development in this very large gold district. The presence of visible gold and the outstanding gold grades of up to 123g/t gold (4oz/t gold) in these initial samples are exceptional and, taken in conjunction with the Company\u2019s other significant discoveries, indicate the potential for the district to become a Tier 1 gold area.\u201c\nFor further information please contact:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com"

The period has been one of great progress for the Company. The Company\u2019s Joint Venture (\u201cJV\u201d) with Demir Export A.S (\u201cDemir Export\u201d) is now well underway to continue the exploration and development of the new district scale gold trend which\nConroy Gold\ndiscovered in the Longford-Down Massif in\nIreland\n.\nA new gold discovery was made post period as announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n, with visible gold and assay results of up to 123 g/t gold in quartz breccia samples during prospecting over the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Newtownhamilton) option area in\nCounty Armagh\nin\nNorthern Ireland\n. The new discovery is potentially a transformational event for gold exploration and development in the Company\u2019s licence area and, taken in conjunction with the Company\u2019s other significant discoveries, indicates the potential for the district to become a Tier I gold area.\nTechnical Results\nTechnical results during the period and post period end included excellent drilling results. A step-out drilling programme on the stockwork demonstrated an extension of over 375 metres to the northeast of the Clontibret gold deposit and extended the bedrock gold mineralisation further outside the gold-in-soil footprint at Clontibret which has a surface area of c.125 hectares.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two styles of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork.\nThree gold lodes, with grades up to 8.3 g/t over 0.5 metres, were intersected in a drill hole located approximately 200 metres to the south of the Corcaskea gold target. This has yielded significant gold intersections in trenches, including 16.5 metres of 6.5 g/t gold and 12 metres of 4.9 g/t gold. The drill hole was 70 metres north-east of the gold outcrop (5.6 g/t gold) discovery which was the crucial first step in establishing continuity between the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret gold deposit, on which the Company has defined a gold resou"

The drill holes are designed to follow up on the gold and antimony plunge trends identified during the detailed re-logging project, as first announced on 27 February 2025.\nFirst Deep Drill Hole Underway\nThe first hole, now in progress, is planned to target the major stockwork zone located beneath the historic Tullybuck Antimony Mine, at approximately 500 metres vertical depth. This hole represents the deepest drilling undertaken on the Clontibret deposit to date.\nThe hole has been designed to intersect more than ten identified lodes before reaching the deeper stockwork zone target. The objective is to enhance the geological understanding of the system and assess the potential for higher-grade, structurally controlled mineralisation at depth.\nFollow-Up Drill Holes\nThe second and third drill holes will test the strike extension of the antimony-bearing lode system toward a postulated northern fault zone believed to separate the Corcaskea mineralisation from the main Clontibret deposit. The holes will also test several of the central gold lodes.\nA second drill-rig is expected to be mobilised before year-end to accelerate this portion of the programme.\nThis drill programme represents the first phase of systematic deeper exploration at Clontibret and is an important step toward evaluating the deposit's potential to host higher-grade mineralisation at depth.\nMr John Sherman, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThis initial package of drilling follows on from the insights into plunge controls at the Clontibret target gained from the re-logging effort.\nThe aim of this body of work is to begin to assess the potential for gold in the system at depth, as well the contribution of antimony to the attractiveness of Clontibret.\"\nAbout Clontibret\nClontibret lies within a major transatlantic structural corridor that extends from Canada, through Ireland, and into Scotland. Within the Irish segment of this corridor, Conroy Gold has established the foundations of two district-scale gold trends spanning more than 95 kilometres of surface gold anomalism. These trends occur entirely within the Company's 100%-owned licence area, which covers a dominant 1,000 km\u00b2 land position.\nClontibret is located in the north east of the 65 kilometre Orlock Bridge gold trend where three targets lie in the 17 kilometre section noted in the above map, the most of advanced of which is Clontibret where a 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) has been defined that remains open in multiple directions including at depth.\nThe Orlock Bridge and Skullmartin trends are hosted within an accretionary prism formed during the oblique collision of the Laurentia and Avalonia tectonic plates and the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. This geological environment comprises Ordovician and Silurian turbidite sequences including greywacke sandstones, conglomerates, siltstones, mudstones, and volcanic units-an established setting globally for significant orogenic gold deposits.\nClontibret - Geological Analogies with Fosterville (+10 Moz)\nThe Clontibret gold target exhibits several key geological features analogous to the high-grade Fosterville Gold Mine in Victoria, Australia (current endowment >10 Moz), indicating the potential for multi-million-ounce gold mineralisation at depth.\nThese analogies include:\nHost Rocks: A folded Ordovician-age turbidite package, comparable to the rock sequence hosting Fosterville's high-grade zones.\nMineralisation Style: At Clontibret gold is intimately associated with acicular arsenopyrite, and to a lesser extent pyrite, similar to the mineralogical style at Fosterville's deposit.\nThe discovery of visible gold in a quartz breccia nearby at Creenkill (with assay values of 123.0 g/t) lends credence to the possib",

Two of the anomalies, being Moyer at 3km by 3km and Shanco at 3km by 1km, cover substantial areas. The regional programme has been very successful at first pass in identifying substantial gold anomalies for further follow up, prospecting and sampling.\nThe anomalies confirm the prospectivity of the Skullmartin gold trend which also hosts multiple gold mineralisation styles including disseminated visible gold in a quartz breccia outcrop at Creenkill to the north east of the trend (where the Company returned the highest gold assay results since the Company began exploration in the Longford -Down massif).\nThe location of the discoveries are set out in the below map:\nThe assay results received from ALS OMAC Laboratories Limited, Loughrea were based on the selection of 265 soil samples of the 468 soil samples collected across the Skullmartin gold trend\non a 1km\n2\nor\n500m\n2\nbases (announced by the Company on\n13 February 2025\n) as part of the licence work commitments carried out over the last 2 years. Thirty of the regional samples had gold-in-soil assay results greater than 5ppb Au up to a maximum of 82ppb Au (anomalies greater than 10ppb gold-in-soil in the Longford-Down Massif tend to be associated with gold-in-bedrock) and enabled the identification of 5 additional gold anomalies.\nMr\nJohn Sherman\n, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThis is a positive step forward with the identification of five new gold anomalies bringing the total on the expanded 30km length Skullmartin trend to seven to date. These discoveries, while early stage, significantly support the exploration potential along the Skullmartin trend where free gold in outcrop with values of up to 123.0g/t Au have been discovered at Creenkill.\"\nAbout the Skullmartin Gold Trend\nConroy Gold's\nSkullmartin trend was discovered by the Company in 2022, is located 20km to the south of the Orlock Bridge gold trend and runs parallel to the Orlock Bridge gold trend.\nIt extends for over 30km and presently comprises seven exploration gold targets. One at Creenkill in\nNorthern Ireland\nand six at Bocks, Clarebane, Knockreagh, Shanco, Taghart and Moyer in the\nRepublic of Ireland\n.\nThe Creenkill gold target followed by the Bocks gold target are the Company's most advanced targets on the Skullmartin gold trend followed by the recent discoveries, particularly Moyer at 3km by 3km and Shanco at 3km by 1km.\nAt the Creenkill gold target the Company has discovered a quartz breccia outcrop which has returned assay results of 123.0 g/t (4 oz) with visible (native) gold (announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n). The assay results are the highest gold assay results since the Company began exploration in the Longford - Down massif and indicates the potential for free gold in the licence areas.\nCreenkill also has multiple gold mineralisation styles present with disseminated visible gold in the quartz breccia outcrop and a zone of arsenopyrite fault gouge grading 1.7 g/t Au running nearly parallel to the quartz breccia outcrop at\n100m\nto the northwest of the outcrop. There are also quartz-pyrite veins giving grades of 2.7 g/t Au running nearly perpendicular to the quartz breccia outcrop.\nInitial trenching at quartz breccia outcrop gave\n1.0m\n@ 64.3 g/t Au and drilling intersected and\n1.2m\n@ 3.8 g/t Au. Trenching thirty five metres to the southwest of the quartz breccia outcrop has identified what is interpreted to be the same zone assaying 17.5 g/t. Approximately one hundred and fifteen metres from the quartz breccia outcrop to the northeast initial trenching and drilling intersected\n1.0m\n@ 6.5 g/t Au and\n0.5m\n@ 11.5 g/t Au. These results to the southwest and northeast of the quartz breccia outcrop extend the surface extent of the zone to approximately 150 metres in length and it remains open.\nTwelve kilometres to the southwest of the Creenkill gold target along the Skullmartin gold trend lies the Bocks gold target covering an area of 1.5km by 1.1km.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo,",

The Corcaskea gold target has yielded significant gold intersections in trenches, including 16.5 metres at 6.5 g/t gold and 12 metres at 4.9g/t gold. The discovery has the potential to upgrade the prospectivity of the Corcaskea gold target as a potential extension of the Clontibret gold resource.\nMcCully's Outcrop was discovered during prospecting and has a grade of 1.5 g/t gold over an approximate width of 25cm. Significantly, the discovery suggests a different structural orientation of mineralisation in the Corcaskea area to that of the Clontibret resource area. The orientation of the lode in McCully's Outcrop is in an East - West orientation and dipping North. This is markedly different from the lodes which strike Northnortheast - Southsouthwest in the Clontibret resource area. Drilling at Corcaskea to date has been informed by the lode strike direction seen in the Clontibret resource area.\nThis outcrop discovery coupled with the ongoing relogging work of drill core at Clontibret and its environs now enhances the Company's understanding of structural orientations and provides a strong case for drilling in a different orientation to expand the resources towards and into the Corcaskea target area.\nMr\nJohn Sherman\n,\nConroy Gold's\nChairman, commented:\n\"\nThe discovery significantly enhances the geological understanding and better establishes controls to guide us in growing the resource into the Corcaskea target area\n.\"\nOutcrop Location\nMcCully's Outcrop lies\n300m\nto the north of the closest drill hole in the Clontibret gold deposit on which the Company has defined a JORC resource of 517,000 ounces of gold (announced by the Company on\n28 July 2017\n) and\n200m\nto the south of the Corcaskea gold target. It is also over\n115m\nto the East of the Lisglassan Stream outcrop discovery (announced on\n22 October 2018\n).\nThe map below shows the location of McCully's Outcrop.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nAbout the \"Discs of Gold\" Project\nConroy Gold's\n\"Discs of Gold\" project in\nIreland\nis defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100 per cent. held under license by the Company and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit. The Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions. The Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest. Gold occurs in multiple styles in the Company's license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit.\nThere are clear geological analogies between the \"Discs of Gold\" targets and large gold deposits in\nSoutheastern Australia\nand\nAtlantic Canada\n.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7469-0930\nTel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\n4182033_0.jpeg\n4182033_1.jpeg",

The samples returned very high gold grades of 21.9 g/t Au and 11.2 g/t Au and results for antimony were above detection limits greater than 1% (10,000 ppb).\nThe samples are with ALS Laboratory for detailed assaying in relation to antimony ore grade content in the samples.\nEncouraging preliminary analysis has already been obtained onsite using a portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) instrument, which returned indicative results in excess of 40 per cent. antimony.\nThis work is part of follow up actions being taken by the Company to demonstrate the antimony potential of Clontibret and in particular to further evaluate the second antimony trend identified by the initial results from remodelling the Clontibret deposit (as announced by the Company on 27\nth\nFebruary 2025\n).\nWork continues on completing the relogging of drill core from the deposit and the construction of a more robust 3D geological model, in tandem with follow up exploration activity in relation to antimony.\nMr\nJohn Sherman\n, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThe discoveries of antimony float which show high gold grades further highlight both the antimony potential of the Clontibret deposit and its correlation to potentially high-grade gold.\nWe are looking forward to exploring the potential of the second antimony trend identified recently to increase the scale of the gold resource within the existing resource footprint.\nThe Company also intends to apply to the European Commission for recognition of Clontibret as a strategic project under the European Critical Raw Materials Act 2024 on the basis of the antimony content\n.\"\nHistorically, the Clontibret area was known for its small-scale antimony mine operations, which were active in the 18\nth\nand 19\nth\ncenturies. Channel sampling of the two historic antimony mines resulted in the first bedrock gold discovery in\nIreland\n. High antimony grades of 14.5% over 1.2 metres were previously recorded together with gold values of up to 35.0 g/t gold over 2 metres.\nHistorical references in a report by Russell 1917 (Report on the Clontibret Antimony mine, Castleblayney,\nCo Monaghan\n) had been made of a trial pit associated with the area where the float boulders were recovered.\nSome references related to the trial pit included in the Russell report are as follows:\n\"On the East bank of the stream in the townland of Lisglassan, 55 feet N.E. of the main shaft, a trial pit has been sunk to a depth of about five feet by the present proprietors. This reveals a vein bearing approximately 45\u00b0 E. of N and underlying about 45\u00b0 N.W. It has a very well-defined footwall, and fairly well-defined hanging wall, and carries a rib of excellent stibnite 8 inches wide.\"\n\"This same pit reveals another rib of antimony 3 inches wide running parallel to and under the stream the direction being approximately that of the main vein as exposed in the north drive from the main shaft. This rib is, therefore, probably, identical with one of these exposed in the drive, which has reached a point almost under the pit.\"\nThe precise location of the trial pit has been lost over time but a recently uncovered map (Figure 1 below) is believed to show the location of this trial pit which also fits the description above by Russell.\nFigure 1: Historical map with assumed location of the historic trial pit marked\n.\nMap from:\nHallissy T 1914 Explanatory Memoir to Sheet 58, illustrating parts of the Counties Armagh, Fermanagh and Monaghan. Memoirs of the geological Survey of\nIreland\n.\nConroy Gold's\nprospecting work to determine the precise location of the trial pit led to the discovery of some spectacular examples of stibnite in float.\nThe company plans to perform further work focused on uncovering the trial pit in order to progress the Company's understanding of a new second trend of antimony previously identified by the Company.\nIt will also assess the potential of this",

The Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions. The Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest. Gold occurs in multiple styles in the Company's license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit. There are clear geological analogies between the \"Discs\" targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This could be significant in targeting high grade gold mineralisation at depth.\nThe detailed pXRF analysis has identified a second trend to the antimony mineralisation at the Clontibret deposit. Antimony was previously mined at Clontibret from two drifts that followed the approximate North \u2013 South orientation of the mineralisation where grades of 14.5 per cent. over 1.2 metres have been recorded. The recent mineralisation shells generated from the pXRF antimony analysis of the drill core from the Clontibret gold deposit has identified a second trend, of a Northeast \u2013 Southwest orientation.\nThis newly identified mineralisation trend parallels that of the stockwork gold mineralisation.\nThe analysis has also identified antimony mineralisation from scout drill holes that were situated on the southern side of the stockwork gold mineralisation. This area had previously not been the focus of detailed exploration; these new results however highlight the significant potential of this area.\nThe Company is progressing with the construction of the 3D geological model and pXRF analysis is continuing on Clontibret drill core from outside of the deposit area. This work contributes to the Company\u2019s ongoing discussions with potential strategic and financial partners on defining and funding the next cycle of major investment in the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project. It also supports the Company\u2019s planned application to the European Union for recognition of Clontibret, with its antimony (Sb) potential, as a strategic project under the European Critical Raw Materials Act of 2024.\nAbout the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d Project\nConroy Gold\u2019s \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project in\nIreland\nis defined by two parallel district scale gold trends,\nextending over c.90km, which are 100 per cent. held under license by the Company, and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit.\nThe Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions.

This work contributes to the Company\u2019s ongoing discussions with potential strategic and financial partners on defining and funding the next cycle of major investment in the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project. It also supports the Company\u2019s planned application to the European Union for recognition of Clontibret, with its antimony (Sb) potential, as a strategic project under the European Critical Raw Materials Act of 2024.\nMr.\nJohn Sherman\n, the Company\u2019s Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe Company continues to actively engage with interested parties to develop partnerships to accelerate and fund the next phases of the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project. The re-logging programme, including the work on the antimony potential of the Clontibret target, is helping to define and prioritise the investment choices to best progress the Discs of Gold project and build shareholder value.\u201d\nRe-logging programme for Clontibret\nConroy Gold is progressing its re-logging programme on 16,000+ metres of drill core at Clontibret, including the near completion of the portable XRF (\u201cpXRF\u201d) analyses for the entire Clontibret gold deposit and target. The objective of the programme is to identify controls to the mineralisation enabling the Company to target high grade zones at depth.\nThe re-logging effort has allowed for a consistent logging approach and pXRF analyses of\nall Clontibret core held by the Company, including that drilled by former partners and operators.\nSignificant information is emerging from the programme, including the overall geometry of folded geology in the deposit.\nThe pXRF analysis across the drill core at the Clontibret gold deposit, taken at one reading every\n0.5m\n, is expected to help identify alteration envelopes that can be used to target high grade gold mineralisation at depth.\nSimilarly, the pXRF information will help define the controls to the antimony mineralisation in the deposit.\nThe re-logging programme is therefore enabling the construction of a 3D geological model to help enhance the Company\u2019s understanding of the controls to mineralisation, particularly in relation to the Fosterville deposit model where grades increase at depth. Construction of this model has commenced starting with cross sections in the existing deposit where the re-logging is complete.\nThe pXRF being used in this work is a Bruker S1 Titan hand-held x-ray fluorescence device which is designed as a \u201cpoint and shoot\u201d analyser that is calibrated for \u201cGeoChem\u201d meaning it is optimised for mining, exploration and grade control.\nThis calibration includes full light element support via dual phase measurement.\nOperating plan for 2025\nThe overriding priority of the Company is to secure asset level investment from strategic and/or financial partners to underwrite the next cycle of major investment into the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project.\nThe upgrading of the geological model will provide a robust foundation upon which follow up drill programmes will be based.\nIt will also enhance the structural understanding of the system enabling the use of alteration halos as a vector to potential higher-grade zones within the system.\nThe Board of Conroy are hopeful that the work in respect to antimony could unlock support for a portion of the project from the European Union.\nContinuation of re-logging programme\nThe remainder of the first half of 2025 will see the Conroy Gold geological team complete its re-logging programme at Clontibret and begin to incorporate drill core from the remaining targets across the Company\u2019s licence areas beginning with its Clay Lake target.\nSince the last resource update for Clontibret in 2017, additional drilling at Clontibret intersected a large stockwork zone (\n95m\n@ 1.0g/t Au) associated with the Orlock Bridge Fault zone.\nA similar broad zone of mineralisation was intersected in a shear zone c.7km to the northeast at Clay Lake gold target (\n100m\n@ 0.6g/t Au) in 2023.\nGeochemical anomalism extends for the entirety o",

There are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs\u201d targets and large gold deposits in\nSoutheastern Australia\nand\nAtlantic Canada\n.\nThe \u201cDiscs\u201d name references two gold \u201cSun Discs\u201d in the collection of the National Museum of\nIreland\n, dated to 2000BC found in\nCo. Monaghan\n, adjacent to the Company\u2019s license area, in the 19\nth\ncentury. The extensive \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project is profiled in the Company\u2019s new corporate presentation, available on the Company\u2019s website (\nwww.conroygold.com\n).\nPreparing for the Next Major Investment Cycle in the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d Project\nThe Conroy Gold geological team has initiated a re-logging program covering over\n30,000m\nof drill core to extract more comprehensive and consistent information.\nThe purpose of this work is to build a robust geological model, identify controls to mineralisation, progress /advance each target and realise the full growth potential of the emerging gold district in Conroy Gold\u2019s license area.\nThe ongoing learnings from this effort will inform our choices for the next cycle of major investment in the project, including in the context of potential joint venture partnerships.\nThe re-logging work and evaluation will apply the geological knowledge gained from recent successes at similar ore systems, including those in the Lachlan Fold Best of southeast\nAustralia\n(Agnico\u2019s\nFosterville\nmines (~10M oz), Southern Cross Gold\u2019s recent\nSunday Creek\ndiscovery and\nAtlantic Canada\n(St Barbara\u2019s Atlantic operations (~2Moz), Calibre Mining\u2019s\nValentine Lake\ndeposit (5Moz+ MI&I), and New Found Gold\u2019s Queensway project).\nThe Company intends to upgrade the geological model to provide a robust foundation upon which follow up drill programs will be based.\nSpecifically, the understanding of alteration halos around such mineral systems has developed and can provide a larger footprint for targeting and growing ore zones.\nThe zonation of such alteration halos, in addition to the structural understanding, can also be used as a vector to higher grade zones within the system.\nWhilst there are c.90km of favourable geochemical and structural trends which have barely been screened to date, a particularly attractive 7km trend from Clontibret to Clay Lake is an emerging focus of the geological work.\nThe Clontibret target has a current resource of 517Koz @ 2g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)).\nThe Clontibret target generated favourable economics in an early study of a prior resource (601Koz @ 1.6g/t Au resource generated an 11 year mine life with 49% IRR and a 2 year payback, 2011).\nSince the last 2017 resource, additional drilling has been undertaken which intersected a large stockwork zone (\n95m\n@ 1.0g/t Au) associa",

Demir Export have expended a total of \u20ac5,657,671 across the licences covered by the joint venture agreement since the JV became unconditional on\n31 March 2022\n. The NSR is at a net smelter return rate of 2% and is capped at the total investment by Demir Export in the project.\nThe Company is pleased with the progress that has been achieved during the JV and now holds licences over two district scale gold trends, the already established Orlock Bridge gold trend together with the newly discovered Skullmartin gold trend. The JV has enabled the Company to accelerate its exploration and drilling activities and has moved the Company from primarily being mineral exploration to having mine development as its main focus.\nThe district scale gold trends are located along the extension of the geological structural corridor from the\nNewfoundland\nprovince in\nCanada\nwhere a number of significant gold deposits have recently been discovered in similar geology.\nThe two gold trends total between them over ninety kilometres, with multiple mineralisation styles ranging from lower grade refractory mineralisation (averaging 2.0g/t Au) through to very high grade vein hosted visible gold mineralisation (grading up to 123 g/t Au in rock chip sampling).\nDrilling and exploration success over these trends during the past 30 months has included:\nexcellent gold intersections from drilling of the stockwork zone of the Clontibret gold target in the Orlock Bridge trend;\ncontinuity between the Clontibret gold deposit and the Corcaskea gold target;\nconfirmation, through step-out drilling, of the potential of the extensive\nClay Lake\ngold target (6Km in length by 2Km in width in some places) for high tonnage and overall gold content; and\nthe discovery at Creenkill, along the Skullmartin gold trend, of visible gold and gold assay results of up to 123 g/t Au (4oz gold per tonne) is particularly significant\nUnder the terms of the NSR agreement, with effect from commercial production, a net smelter return, at a rate of 2%, will be paid to Demir Export calculated on the sales of minerals.\nThe maximum aggregate amount payable to the Royaltyholder (being Demir Export) shall be capped at the amount of the total investment by Demir Export.\nThe 15 licences that were subject to the JV with Demir Export will continue to be held within wholly owned subsidiaries of Conroy being: (i)\nConroy Gold\n(Clontibret) Limited- which holds the Clontibret licence; (ii)\nConroy Gold\n(\nArmagh\n) Ltd- which holds the licences and Mines Royal options in\nNorthern Ireland\n; and (iii)\nConroy Gold\n(Longford Down) Limited- which holds the remaining prospecting licences in the\nRepublic of Ireland\npreviously subject to the JV. As a result of the exit of the JV and the granting of the NSR to Demir Export, Demir Export will no longer retain any rights to earn-in to the wholly owned subsidiaries that were originally set up as part of the JV agreement.\nThe Clontibret gold deposit to date has a defined gold resource of 517,000oz (JORC 2012).\nThe deposit shows at shallow depths a similar style of mineralisation to the shallow section of the\nFosterville\ngold deposit in\nAustralia\n, and the targeting concept at depth is similar to the very high grade Swan Zone discovered at depth at\nFosterville\n.\nA new partner will now be sought by\nConroy Gold\nto build on the success achieved to date and on the potential for the development of one, or more, gold mines along the district scale gold trends which the Company has discovered.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\"I would like to express my appreciation for the contribution which Demir Export has made in conjunction with\nConroy Gold\nto the continued success of the Company's exploration programme and its potential for gold deposits with high tonnage and overall gold content.\n\"\nConroy Gold\nnow holds licences over two district scale gold trends, which includes the Clontibret gold deposit with its similarities to the very major\nFosterville\ngold mine in\nAustralia\n, the extensive\nClay Lake\n(Derryhennet) gold target, and the exciting C",

The Company is now in the attractive position of having discovered two new district scale gold trends and of having secured the land position over both entire gold trends. The Board is hopeful that they may well have discovered a world class gold deposit on the Derryhennet section of the Clay Lake target.\nThe Company\u2019s licences, totalling 20 in number, comprise 14 licences in the Orlock Bridge gold trend and 6 in the Skullmartin gold trend. The Orlock Bridge gold trend extends for over 65km (c.40 miles) whilst the Skullmartin gold trend extends for over 25km (c.15miles) and lies approximately 20km south of the Orlock Bridge trend. An earn-in Joint Venture (the \u201cJV\u201d) with Demir Export\nA.\u015e\n(\u201cDemir Export\u201d), in three phases, has been agreed over 15 of the licences.\nDuring the course of phase 1 of the JV, which includes the current period, all exploration costs expended on the 15 licences in the JV are being covered by the JV partner in order to earn a 25% interest in these licences, incurring a minimum expenditure of over \u20ac6.5 million. To earn a further 15% interest a further minimum expenditure of \u20ac5.5 million in Phase 2 of the JV agreement must be made.\nTo proceed with a mining project in any of these licences the JV partner must cover, in Phase 3, all further expenditure required, including costs associated with drilling, laboratory test work, environmental studies and acquisition of planning and mine licences, together with land acquisition costs, to bring the JV partner\u2019s interest up to 57.5 per cent in that particular mining project, or in any further mining projects over the JV licences, with\nConroy Gold\nretaining 42.5 per cent in each one.\nAt\n30 November 2023\n, Demir Export had invested \u20ac4,807,218 in the subsidiary companies with convertible shares issued for the first \u20ac2,557,218 of this investment and the balance to be issued post period end in line with the agreement.\nThe significant potential of the Clay Lake gold target, in terms of high tonnage, overall gold content and mineability, in particular in the Derryhennet section of the target which is an orogenic folded black carbonaceous shale, is such that it could possibly be a world class gold target.

The results included 31.0 metres gold zone intersection at 1.0 g/t gold (including grades up to 3.2 g/t gold) and a 29.0 metres gold zone at 0.9 g/t gold (including 16.0 metres 1.2 g/t gold).\nThe Derryhennet section of the gold target is an orogenic folded black carbonaceous shale hosted gold target and is up to 1Km in length and 2Km in width. The step-out drilling programme has confirmed good continuity of the gold Stockwork zone at Derryhennet which now stands at over 400 metres in length and is still open. The continued encountering in this programme of wide gold intersections at relatively shallow depths further indicates the potential for high tonnage, overall gold content and mineability in this part of the Clay Lake gold target.\nThe drilling programme is being carried out in conjunction with joint venture partner, Demir Export A.\u015e (\"Demir Export\").\nThe two drill holes, which totalling\n493.8m\n, complete an eight-hole (\n2,303.3m\n) step-out drill programme on the Derryhennet section of the Company's Clay Lake gold target bringing the total drilling to date at Derryhennet to 5,067.0 metres in twenty five drill holes. The overall Clay Lake gold target is 3Km in length and in places 2Km wide.\nThe first drill hole, CGA-22-001, was drilled to a down hole depth of 190.3 metres, at a 60 degree dip, and intersected a series of gold zones including 29.0 metres grading 0.9 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 26.0 metres and 31.0 metres at 1.0 g/t gold with grades up to 3.2 g/t gold within 38.0 metres grading 0.9 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 107.0 metres.\nThis hole was situated\n300m\nto the northeast of the drill hole (CGA-22-005) which intersected 40.5 metres at 1.2 g/t gold and c.100.\n0m\nto the northeast of the drill hole which intersected 100.0 metres at 0.6 g/t gold, at a depth of 26.4 metres, which is believed to be the longest continuous gold intersection in the British Isles.\nThe second drill hole, CGA-22-008, was drilled to a down hole depth of 317.5 metres, at a 60 degree dip, and intersected 2.0 metres at 1.0 g/t gold from\n126.0m\n, 4.0 metres at 1.1 g/t gold from 155.0 metres, 3.0 metres to 1.6 g/t gold from 267.0 metres and 2.0 metres at 1.0 g/t gold from 280.0 metres.\nIntercepts from drill holes CGA-22-001 and CGA-22-008 at Derryhennet include:\nCGA-22-001\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n10.0m\n2.0m\n@ 0.3 g/t Au from\n19.0m\n29.0m\n@ 0.9 g/t Au from\n26.0m\ninc.\n16.0m\n@ 1.2 g/t Au from\n26.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.6 g/t Au from\n93.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n103.0m\n38.0m\n@ 0.9 g/t Au from\n107.0m\ninc.\n31.0m\n@ 1.0 g/t Au from\n112.0m\n1.3m\n@ 0.6 g/t Au from\n172.0m\nCGA-22-008\n1.0m\n@ 0.3 g/t Au from\n55.0m\n2.0m\n@ 0.5 g/t Au from\n59.5m\n0.5m\n@ 0.8 g/t Au from\n72.0m\n2.0m\n@ 1.0 g/t Au from\n126.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.3 g/t Au from\n135.0m\n4.0m\n@ 1.1 g/t Au from\n155.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.3 g/t Au from\n165.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.3 g/t Au from\n169.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.6 g/t Au from\n205.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n219.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.3 g/t Au from\n224.0m\n4.0m\n@ 0.5 g/t Au from\n229.0m\n3.0m\n@ 1.6 g/t Au from\n267.0m\n2.0m\n@ 1.0 g/t Au from\n280.0m\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented)\nAll samples were analysed by ALS (OMAC Laboratories) Loughrea using Au-ICP21 (Au by fire assay and ICP-AES 30g sample).\nFollowing these excellent results further step-out drilling is being considered on the Derryhennet section of the Clay Lake gold target.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\"These results highlight the massive potential of the Derryhennet folded orogenic black carbonaceous shale hosted section of the\nClay Lake gold target.\nThe step-out drilling programme has previously intersected\n40.5m\nat 1.2 g/t gold in the southwest of Derryhennet and, in this drilling to the northeast,\n38.0m\nat 0.9 g/t gold.\nOrogenic black carbonaceous shale hosted gold targets can contain multimillion ounce gold dep",

The ongoing drilling programme is being carried out in conjunction with the Company's joint venture partner, Demir Export A.\u015e (\"Demir Export\").\nThe Company's licenced areas over the Orlock Bridge and Skullmartin gold trends now cover an area in excess of 1,000km\n2\n. Geophysics and geochemical sampling have shown a series of targets over both gold trends. These targets require follow up exploration including scout trenching and/or scout drilling. A scout drill hole is a drill hole used to ascertain the presence of mineralisation or to explore an area in a preliminary\nmanner.\nOrlock Bridge Gold Trend: Corcaskea Gold Target\nThe scout drilling programme at the Corcaskea gold target, which forms part of the overall Clontibret gold target, consisted of three holes for a total of 666.2 metres.\nThe drilling intersected gold outside the current Clontibret resource area and to depth which demonstrates that the Clontibret resource is still very much open in all directions. The drilling is approximately 200 metres north from a previous drill hole which intersected 8.3 g/t gold over 0.5 of a metre (as announced by the Company on 2\nnd\nFebruary 2023\n).\nHole Id\nLength (m)\nGrade (g/t)\nFrom (m)\nCOR-23-001\n1.4\n0.7\n45.9\nCOR-23-003\n1.0\n2.5\n0.4\n0.6\n154.0\n199.0\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented).\nA series of shallow dipping mineralised lode structures have been interpreted at Corcaskea which is different to the lode structures at the Clontibret deposit which are relatively steep dipping. Some of the mineralised lode structure intersected in the recent drilling suffered from poor core recovery particularly the\n1.4m\n@ 0.7 g/t Au from\n45.9m\nwhich recorded less than 45% recovery.\nOrlock Bridge Gold Trend: Corraweelis Gold Target\nThe scout drilling programme at the Corraweelis gold target, which lies within the overall Slieve Glah gold target area, consisted of two holes for a total of 544.7 metres.\nThe programme was designed around a deep overburden sampling programme which gave highly anomalous gold values. 81 deep overburden samples were previously collected of which 28 samples recorded assay results above 10ppb Au, with 14 samples returning assay results greater than 100 ppb Au. Two samples of 1,160 ppb Au (1.16 g/t Au) and 1,425 ppb Au (1.425 g/t Au), respectively, were previously recorded at the Corraweelis gold target (as announced by the Company on\n23rd March 2023\n).\nThe Corraweelis target area is over a 1km northeast from previous drilling and 1.5km northeast from drill hole SG-01-08 which intersected\n1.0m\n@ 1.5 g/t gold from\n94.0m\n.\nHole Id\nLength (m)\nGrade (g/t)\nFrom (m)\n3130-23-001\n1.0\n1.2\n1.0\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n122.0\n146.9\n157.0\n3130-23-002\n1.0\n1.0\n0.3\n0.3\n129.0\n138.0\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented).\nThese drill hole results are the first gold-in-bedrock intersections in the Corraweelis gold target area. The Corraweelis gold anomaly extends over a length of\n500m\nwhich is still open at both ends and is\n200m\nwide. Both drill holes crossed the width of the gold anomaly, one on the very south-western end and the other on the north-eastern portion.\nOrlock Bridge Gold Trend: Dunraymond Gold Target\nA drilling programme consisting of two holes (3028-23-001 and 3028-23-002) for a total of 582.6 metres at the Dunraymond gold target, which lies within the overall Glenish gold target, has also been completed.\nThe drilling tested interpreted structures within a large (\n550m\nby\n600m\n) deep overburden geochemical gold anomaly which has previously been identified at Dunraymond through 363 deep overburden samples, collected on a c.50m grid basis. These samples included gold values of up to 447 ppb Au (as announced by the Company on\n4th September 2023\n).\nThe drill holes were located over\n700m\nfrom the previous drilling (Drill hole GL10) in Glenish, which gave assay results of\n2.3m\n@ 2.7 g/t gold from\n18.0m\n, and over\n750m\nfrom an outcrop where the Company intersected\n1.0m\n@ 9.4 g/t gold.\nDrill hole 3028-23-001 tested the large Glenish fault zone within the geochemical gold anomaly and intersected it from\n179.4m\nto\n233.6m\n, i.e. the end of the drill hole, giving a\n54.2m\nintersection.

The results included an 80.0 metre gold zone intersection at 0.5 g/t gold including 9.0 metres at 1.0 g/t gold and a 32.0 metre gold zone intersection at 0.7 g/t gold with grades up to 3.1 g/t gold. The drilling programme is being carried out in conjunction with the Company's joint venture partner, Demir Export A.\u015e (\"Demir Export\").\nThe first drill hole, CGA-22-003, was drilled to a down hole depth of 201.0 metres and intersected 32.0 metres grading 0.7 g/t gold, with grades going up to 3.1 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 105.0 metres.\nThe second drill hole, CGA-22-004, was drilled to a down hole depth of 317.5 metres and intersected 80.0 metres at 0.5g/t gold, including 9.0 metres at 1.0 g/t gold, from a depth of 33.0 metres.\nThe drill holes indicate significantly wide and shallow\nmineralised zones.\nThe 80.0 metre intersection in the second drill hole is c.100m to the southwest of where the Company intersected 100.0 metres at 0.6 g/t gold, at a depth of 26.4 metres, which is believed to be the longest continuous gold intersection in the British Isles. Both drill holes were on the same drill section line and, together with previous drilling on the Clay Lake gold target, demonstrate both continuity of the gold stockwork zone and that the gold mineralisation remains open.\nThe continued intersection of wide zones of gold mineralisation in the very large Clay Lake gold target extends for 3km in length, and is in many areas 2km in width, and as such indicates its potential for high tonnage and overall gold content.\nThe Clay Lake gold target is situated in the northern eastern section of the 65km Orlock Bridge gold trend. The Orlock Bridge gold trend is one of two district scale gold trends, (the other being the Skullmartin gold trend, 10km to the south) which the Company has discovered in the Longford- Down Massif in\nIreland\n.\nA series of gold targets, including Clay Lake, have been discovered along both gold trends.\nIntercepts from the two drill holes (totalling c.518.\n5m\n) at the Clay Lake gold target include:\nCGA-22-004\n\u00b7\n2.5m\n@ 0.6 g/t Au from\n19.5m\n\u00b7\n80.0m\n@ 0.5 g/t Au from\n33.0m\ninc.\n9.0m\n@ 1.0 g/t Au from\n54.0m\n\u00b7\n2.0m\n@ 0.6 g/t Au from\n189.0m\n\u00b7\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n198.0m\nCGA-22-003\n1.0m\n@ 0.5 g/t Au from\n46.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.6 g/t Au from\n50.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n68.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.5 g/t Au from\n73.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n100.0m\n32.0m\n@ 0.7 g/t Au inc. 1.0xm @ 3.1 g/t Au from\n105.0m\n1.0m\n@ 0.4 g/t Au from\n162.0m\n1.0m\n@ 1.0 g/t Au from\n165.0m\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented)\nAll samples were analysed by ALS (OMAC Laboratories) Loughrea using Au-ICP21 (Au by fire assay and ICP-AES 30g sample).\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\"These excellent results re-affirm the potential of the Clay Lake gold target for both high tonnage and overall gold content and taken in conjunction with the sheer size of the target indicate that the Clay Lake gold target could be, in the Board's view, of world class significance.\"\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7469-0930\nTel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\n3896572_0.jpeg",

(\u201cDemir Export\u201d) became fully operational.\nA major feature of the year was the discovery of a second district scale gold trend in the Longford-Down Massif in\nIreland\n, where the Company previously discovered the Orlock Bridge gold trend, also a district scale gold trend.\nThe new gold trend lies along a geological structure known as the Skullmartin Fault Zone, lying to the south of the Orlock Bridge Fault Zone.\nThis new gold trend, the Skullmartin gold trend, extends for approximately 24km and, like the Orlock Bridge gold trend, has the potential to hold many gold targets. The Company has already identified a highly exciting discovery along the new trend at Creenkill in\nCounty Armagh\nwith visible gold and gold assay results of up 123 g/t Au (4oz gold per tonne).\nAs well as the discovery of the new gold trend, an extensive drilling programme across the JV licence area has yielded other highly important and exciting results, both during the period under review and post year end. The drilling programme included step-out and stockwork drilling on the Clontibret gold deposit.\nThis has shown continuity between the Clontibret gold deposit and the Corcaskea gold target, where historic trenching demonstrated high gold grades and has extended the deposit 400 metres to the North",

Additionally, a deep overburden (\"DOB\") sampling programme has identified new drilling targets over five licence areas. 4 new anomalous gold areas have been identified in the vicinity of the newly discovered Creenkill gold target, in\nCo Armagh\n. The drilling and DOB sampling programmes are being carried out in association with the Company's JV partner, Demir Export.\nThe JV programme, which is an earn-in JV, is structured over three phases of work\n.\nPhase 1 - \u20ac4.5 million, plus minimum regulatory work commitments (\"MRWC\") on all JV licences (plus \u20ac1m on signing agreement) to earn an initial 25% across all of the JV licences.\nPhase 2 - \u20ac4.5 million, plus MRWC, to earn a further 15%.\nPhase 3 - all expenditure required to bring a given project to shovel ready status (including all planning and land acquisition costs) to earn a further 17.5% (total 57.5%) in that given project with\nConroy Gold\nretaining the right to a 42.5% interest or to avail of one or other of the various options under the joint venture agreement, details of which have been previously announced.\nThe DOB assay results reported in today's announcement form part of an on-going overall technical assessment, incorporating drilling together with extensive soil and deep overburden sampling and geophysics, across both district scale gold trends which the Company has discovered in the Longford - Down gold district. The primary focus of the joint venture is to develop a mine at Clontibret, or elsewhere along the gold trends, with the long-term objective of the delivery of a series of mine developments across the new gold districts.\nA total of 1,519 DOB samples have been collected over 5 separate areas (Creenkill 470 samples, Dunraymond 363, Rackwallace 137, Rockcorry 422 and Avalbane 127) within the Longford-Down Massif on a c.50m grid basis.\n500 samples returned results greater than, or equal to, 10 ppb Au (samples of 10 ppb Au, or higher, tend to be associated with the presence of underlying bedrock gold). 11 samples returned results greater than, or equal to, 100 ppb Au.\nThe maximum gold value returned was 447 ppb Au, in a sample taken in the Dunraymond area. The second highest result returned was 442 ppb Au from the Rockcorry gold target.\nIn the Creenkill gold target, four anomalous gold areas have been identified, two to the south of the exciting quartz breccia discovery, which returned values up to 123.0 g/t Au (announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n) and the other two up strike\n250m\nto the Northeast and\n400m\ndown strike to the Southwest from the quartz breccia. A further DOB sampling programme is planned to extend the current coverage of DOB sampling to the Northeast. Drilling is ongoing at Creenkill.\nIn Dunraymond, which lies within the Glenish gold target, and where the anomalous gold value of 447 ppb Au was discovered, the programme has identified a consistently anomalous gold area covering\n550m\nby\n600m\n. Follow up drilling is underway.\nIn Rackwallace, the sampling has extended the Rackwallace gold anomaly 180 metres to the Southwest. The gold anomaly still remains open to the South. Follow up drilling is planned.\nIn Rockcorry, a highly anomalous gold target area, measuring 700 metres by 350 metres has been defined. The anomaly is still open to the Northwest and Southeast. Follow up drilling is planned.\nIn Avalbane, an anomalous gold target measuring 200 metres by 180 metres, was defined by the deep overburden sampling programme.

This licence area also previously yielded sediment samples, which returned gold values of up to 170ppb Au, as part of the nationwide TELLUS survey.\nThe new gold discovery in\nCounty Monaghan\n, and the recently announced gold discovery in quartz breccia samples (which had assay results of up to 123.0 g/t gold) in\nCounty Armagh\n, have both been recorded along a major geological structure, the Skullmartin Fault Zone, indicating the presence of a second gold trend in the Longford-Down Massif.\nThe newly identified (24km) gold trend lies parallel to, and south of, the Orlock Bridge Fault Zone, on which the Company has made a series of gold discoveries along a 65 km gold trend.\nThe new trend, along the Skullmartin Fault Zone, links the\nCounty Monaghan\ngold discovery, as announced today, to the recent gold discovery in quartz breccia samples in\nCounty Armagh\n.\nThe Company also announces that applications for five further prospecting licences along the trend have been made by the Company.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe identification of a new gold trend in the Longford \u2013 Down Massif is a further step forward in relation to the very extensive new gold district discovered by the Company.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com",

The period has been one of great progress for the Company. The Company\u2019s Joint Venture (\u201cJV\u201d) with Demir Export A.S (\u201cDemir Export\u201d) is now well underway to continue the exploration and development of the new district scale gold trend which\nConroy Gold\ndiscovered in the Longford-Down Massif in\nIreland\n.\nA new gold discovery was made post period as announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n, with visible gold and assay results of up to 123 g/t gold in quartz breccia samples during prospecting over the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Newtownhamilton) option area in\nCounty Armagh\nin\nNorthern Ireland\n. The new discovery is potentially a transformational event for gold exploration and development in the Company\u2019s licence area and, taken in conjunction with the Company\u2019s other significant discoveries, indicates the potential for the district to become a Tier I gold area.\nTechnical Results\nTechnical results during the period and post period end included excellent drilling results. A step-out drilling programme on the stockwork demonstrated an extension of over 375 metres to the northeast of the Clontibret gold deposit and extended the bedrock gold mineralisation further outside the gold-in-soil footprint at Clontibret which has a surface area of c.125 hectares.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two styles of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork.\nThree gold lodes, with grades up to 8.3 g/t over 0.5 metres, were intersected in a drill hole located approximately 200 metres to the south of the Corcaskea gold target. This has yielded significant gold intersections in trenches, including 16.5 metres of 6.5 g/t gold and 12 metres of 4.9 g/t gold. The drill hole was 70 metres north-east of the gold outcrop (5.6 g/t gold) discovery which was the crucial first step in establishing continuity between the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret gold deposit, on which the Company has defined a gold resou",

The programme is being carried out in association with the Company\u2019s joint venture partner, Demir Export A.?.\nThe Clay Lake gold target in\nCounty Armagh\nis one of a series of targets discovered by the Company along the 65 km (45 Mile) gold trend. A JORC resource of 517,000oz/Au has been estimated on a small part of the Clontibret gold deposit in\nCounty Monaghan\n(previously announced by the Company on\n28 July 2017\n).\nThe step out drilling programme at the Clay Lake gold target forms part of an overall assessment of the gold and base metal potential of the joint venture area. Eight holes on the Derryhennet section of the Clay Lake gold target, totalling approximately\n2,000m\n, are planned initially. Drilling is also planned in due course on other targets along the gold trend.\nThe overall Clay Lake gold target forms a single large gold-in-soil anomaly, over 200 Ha (c.500 acres) in area and is nearly 3km in length, which in places is 2km wide (as previously announced by the Company on\n28 January 2016\n). This is a much larger gold-in-soil footprint than at the Clontibret gold target. The drilling programme at Clay Lake will step out from the known gold mineralisation, where previous trenching and drilling has yielded trenching results of up to\n5m\nat 3.0g/t gold and, drilling, a continuous gold intersection of\n100m\nat 0.6g/t gold (including\n11.8m\nat 1.4g/t Au).\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cI am delighted to see drilling at the Clay Lake gold target. The initial drilling programme at Clay Lake forms part of the overall assessment of the gold trend which the Company has discovered. We are, of course, looking at an entire new gold district which contains many gold targets along the trend, including the Clontibret gold deposit, where results have been excellent including the recent drilling that demonstrated the continuity between that deposit and the Corcaskea gold target.\nI would also like to refer interested parties to the Company website where there is a map showing the location of the trend and the areas that have been identified, giving a picture of its potential and the work being undertaken.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com",

These three gold zones include 2 metres at 2.1 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au), 1.5 metres at 3.2 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au) and 0.5 metre at 0.8 g/t Au. The first gold mineralisation was intersected at a relatively shallow down hole depth of 27.5 metres.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two style of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork. The assay results reported on today relate to the lode style mineralisation.\nThe stockwork resource also contributes to the overall contained ounces. Three previous drill holes totalling 1,053 metres in a step out drilling programme have also demonstrated, through intersections of gold in the stockwork, that the Clontibret gold deposit extends 375 metres to the north-east (announced by the Company on 18 January 2023).\nThe lode gold zone intersections between the Clontibret gold resource and the Corcaskea gold target, which were reported in the assay results from this drill hole, open up the surrounding area for further step out drilling and the probability of linking the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret resource area which are 535 metres apart.\nThe drill hole was drilled to a down hole depth of 268.5 metres at a -60 degree angle and drilled to the east (Azimuth 090).\nDrill Hole Intersections:\n\u2022\n2.0m\n@ 2.1 g/t Au from\n27.5m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au from\n28.5m\n\u2022\n1.5m\n@ 3.2 g/t Au from\n40.0m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au from\n41.0m\n\u2022\n0.5m\n@ 0.8 g/t Au from\n88.5m\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented)\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe Board believes that these results provide further evidence of the continuity between the Clontibret gold target and the Corcaskea area, where excellent gold intersections have been recorded in trenching, including 16.5 metres at 6.5 g/t gold, and 12 metres at 4.9 g/t gold.\nThe results are also a further indication of the overall gold potential of the 65 km gold trend which the Company has discovered. Many other gold targets have been identified along the trend including, for example, the Clay Lake gold target, which has a far larger gold-in-soil target footprint than Clontibret.\nIn addition to Clontibret, the Board looks forward to demonstrating the overall potential of the gold trend, on which in the north-eastern segment alone, we have a gold exploration target of 8.8 million ounces in addition to the JORC resource of 517,000 oz gold.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377",

The first hole will be 500m. I think the other 2 might be less than that. As for double digit grams over double digit metres that would obviously be good.

They drilled multiple other prospects with no material results, and Clay Lake which was too low grade. Therefore no progress with development, they walked.

They are investing in Irish gold in a big way - worth looking how many millions they spent to acquire majority stake in Galantas' Irish property - while Galantas plc are pivoting towards Chile. https://galantas.com/news/galantas-gold-closes-transaction-to-form-joint-venture-with-ocean-partners-uk-limited-to-develop-omagh-gold-project-in-northern/ The fact these guys are pouring big cash into renovating that mine north of the border is telling.  Then you look at the links here. Conroy own land in area surrounding that mine. Conroy's gold is on same geological fault line. And south of the border, as we know Conrory have a significant amount gold in the ground - hundreds of thousands of ounces - more gold than the Ocean Partners property. Once that gold is dug up, the Ocean Partners property could provide the processing facilities. The more you look, the more links and synergies you find. I'd say some form of M&A is nailed on here.",

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

Presumably this is what new investors bought into and if you think that is going to be a quick win then you are in the wrong game. First thing they should do is hire a geologist to lead the company and that takes at least three months for someone decent. Six or seven months until drill results so not a lot for PIs to get excited about, especially on the London market where there is clearly very little / low interest in this.",

For three decades it was the former hobby of a nutty professor with an obsession to find leprechaun gold, now passed. He did, however, find a small low-grade deposit and has decades of amassed data and kilometers of archived core, and very serendipitously a top-notch Aussie gold geo with a glowing career record did a year of pro-bono consulting, identified the problems and showed the way forward. It's an all-or-nothing shot to prove up her concept, and you just raised \u00a32M as your effective IPO from new overseas investors who know a thing or two about the business. What do you do? 1. Follow her recommendations, re-log all the old core and update the resource (promised but as-yet not delivered). 2. Put the old lady who was the nutty professors' sidekick and is now running the show, and her nephew in accounts, out to pasture and fire the staff geos who have spent nearly two decades dicking around, costing \u00a3millions, drilling a hole here or there but mostly sitting drinking coffee or working on their PowerPoint skills, and hire some consultants/contractors as required. 3. Clear your board of irrelevant deadwood, especially the nutty professors' family, friends and former cronies. 4. Appoint a top notch gold expert with an international reputation, both technically and in the market, to run the show, with a generous performance-based package (options). 5. Crack on with the proof-of-concept program you were handed on a plate ASAP, because without it, it's a busted flush anyway, and get the news out quick so you can reward shareholders, attract a partner and fund its further development. The current impasse strikes me as \"many a great story has been ruined by drilling it\". I for one would like to know or move on. It's either a multi-Moz high-grade deposit at $4,250/oz or it isn't.",

All they have done is file licence renewals to keep the show going. The directors have, at least, finally stopped holding the company to ransom after decades of over-paying themselves. No doubt a condition of the new money. They raised over \u00a33M in three placings, a loan note and a warrants exercise but still haven't done anything practical. Zero mention of any JV activity or progress, because we must assume, nobody is biting! They still managed to pay themselves \u20ac666,000, up \u20ac200,000 from last year. The little old lady we never hear from still got her \u20ac125k, and despite saving the \u20ac200k on the nutty professor, management salaries only went down \u20ac35k to \u20ac258k. The 6 [SIX!] exploration staff took home the other ~\u20ac400k. Oh, and they bilked the shareholders of their \"other\" company another \u20ac240k, of which Jonesy collected a further \u20ac60k.",

Nothing wrong with this, the problem is an ineffectual managenent who refuse to make progress yet continue to extract wealth from shareholders into their own pockets. You can rest assured that the writing down of \u00a33.5M of historic debt to directors was an absolute condition of raising the new money at 10p, and yet per the results, the graft continues. Jones, who features in zero publicity or leadership was paid \u20ac125k this year for cripe's sake! For what??? When I first started posting on this little foray into AIM the SP was 20p for 30M shares on the back of a \u00a35M cash injection. It dropped to 2p.

Everybody that knows anything about this company knows what a piece of scum you are. How many years have you spent saying that cgnr have nothing and it's all a big con. You are a total moron. Oh and by the way if the drilling is successful I'll make a lot of money because I've been buying all the way from 2p when you were calling it a strong sell dumbo.",

They didn't prove more ounces, they didn't prove anything. At least this will yield some meaningful information. There was a map on the drilling RNS that shows the location of the 3 drill holes. The first hole will be 500m. I think the other 2 might be less than that. As for double digit grams over double digit metres that would obviously be good. Even grades of half that would be something though if the widths are good. It would prove that Clontibret is much bigger than 500k oz.",

They did stepout drilling which was negative (and pre JV CGNR did infill drilling which had no impact on  the resource - no increase in ounces, no classification upgrade). They drilled multiple other prospects with no material results, and Clay Lake which was too low grade. Therefore no progress with development, they walked. Far from proving nothing, they proved it is not a development project. The current strategy is a different one - to explore a high grade underground concept. Will it yield meaninful information?

In 1984 he made the headlines when he flew a light aircraft under the arches of the Eiffel Tower.

Then you look at the links here. Conroy own land in area surrounding that mine. Conroy's gold is on same geological fault line. And south of the border, as we know Conrory have a significant amount gold in the ground - hundreds of thousands of ounces - more gold than the Ocean Partners property. Once that gold is dug up, the Ocean Partners property could provide the processing facilities. The more you look, the more links and synergies you find. I'd say some form of M&A is nailed on here.",

They did stepout drilling which was negative (and pre JV CGNR did infill drilling which had no impact on  the resource - no increase in ounces, no classification upgrade). They drilled multiple other prospects with no material results, and Clay Lake which was too low grade. Therefore no progress with development, they walked. Far from proving nothing, they proved it is not a development project. The current strategy is a different one - to explore a high grade underground concept. Will it yield meaninful information? Hope you are right.",

If you don't know about Bob Moriarty, his web site is http://www.321gold.com/ He was the youngest USAF pilot in the Vietnam War.  He flew the most missions in the Vietnam War.  In 1984 he made the headlines when he flew a light aircraft under the arches of the Eiffel Tower.    He has been running 321gold for 25 years and visited hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mining projects.",

Where it gets more interesting is if you look at some of the deals Haywood have overseen. Canadian Nickel Company was one, that's seen blockbuster returns as Canadian government took a big stake in it. And most recently Galantas Gold. Galantas links to Conroy probably go without saying, both geologically and as the only other listed name in Irish gold. Galantas has seen spectacular gains this year with a deal brokered by none other than Haywood.",

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

Then you look at the links here. Conroy own land in area surrounding that mine. Conroy's gold is on same geological fault line. And south of the border, as we know Conrory have a significant amount gold in the ground - hundreds of thousands of ounces - more gold than the Ocean Partners property. Once that gold is dug up, the Ocean Partners property could provide the processing facilities. The more you look, the more links and synergies you find. I'd say some form of M&A is nailed on here.",

Canadian Nickel Company was one, that's seen blockbuster returns as Canadian government took a big stake in it. And most recently Galantas Gold.

Anyone, including the usual green suspects and their barristers in far-away leafy Dublin suburbs, can throw spanners in the works. Ireland has history here! It's not all down to the locals hoping to score big on land sales and jobs. The hope here has to be that grades sufficient to justify underground costs and too deep for an open pit are found in this next drilling round, because a massive low-grade open pit is problematic. The issues with low-grades are the enormous volume of tailings, and open pits, the large volume of waste rock generated. Both require unsightly, land-hungry surface disposal, and will be rich in pyrite, arsenic and other nasties, prone to AMD. Nearby massive gypsum pits and limestone quarries cited as precedents don't have these issues! Bear in mind, Dalradian's plan is all undergound at 13-15g/t and still ran into problems. Better to face the issues and work around them than stick your fingers in your ears and whistle, as you seem to be doing. Pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't make it go away. Some clarity/assurance they are pre-empting this from the company would help here!",

They drilled multiple other prospects with no material results, and Clay Lake which was too low grade. Therefore no progress with development, they walked.

There is also the antimony. How significant is that going to be for the economics of Clontibret? What do you believe Goldbug?

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

He is investment manager at Haywood, big players in Canadian mining equity deals https://www.haywood.com/ So a pretty big name to have bought into a micro cap like this. Where it gets more interesting is if you look at some of the deals Haywood have overseen. Canadian Nickel Company was one, that's seen blockbuster returns as Canadian government took a big stake in it. And most recently Galantas Gold. Galantas links to Conroy probably go without saying, both geologically and as the only other listed name in Irish gold. Galantas has seen spectacular gains this year with a deal brokered by none other than Haywood.",

If you don't know about Bob Moriarty, his web site is http://www.321gold.com/ He was the youngest USAF pilot in the Vietnam War.  He flew the most missions in the Vietnam War.  In 1984 he made the headlines when he flew a light aircraft under the arches of the Eiffel Tower.    He has been running 321gold for 25 years and visited hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mining projects.",

Ms Moroney's deep high grade concept will be the make-or-break, however. If anything has kept my interest, it's been her previous input. As you are so in management's pocket as you claim, how about asking them to release more timely updates on drilling results, like a time line for metres and assay results? Comparable companies at this make-or-break stage bombard the market with technical updates on an almost weekly basis. Rigs operating, metres drilled, assays as they come in. Rigs can easily drill 25-35m a day, that's 500m a fortnight, and assays can be turned around in under a week if the lab is down the road.",

They drilled multiple other prospects with no material results, and Clay Lake which was too low grade. Therefore no progress with development, they walked.

There is also the antimony. How significant is that going to be for the economics of Clontibret? What do you believe Goldbug?

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

He is investment manager at Haywood, big players in Canadian mining equity deals https://www.haywood.com/ So a pretty big name to have bought into a micro cap like this. Where it gets more interesting is if you look at some of the deals Haywood have overseen. Canadian Nickel Company was one, that's seen blockbuster returns as Canadian government took a big stake in it. And most recently Galantas Gold. Galantas links to Conroy probably go without saying, both geologically and as the only other listed name in Irish gold. Galantas has seen spectacular gains this year with a deal brokered by none other than Haywood.",

If you don't know about Bob Moriarty, his web site is http://www.321gold.com/ He was the youngest USAF pilot in the Vietnam War.  He flew the most missions in the Vietnam War.  In 1984 he made the headlines when he flew a light aircraft under the arches of the Eiffel Tower.    He has been running 321gold for 25 years and visited hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mining projects.",

Details of these can be found below and a full copy of the interim results statement can be viewed on the Company\u2019s website.\nHighlights:\nRestructuring completed in relation to amounts owing to Directors and former Directors in excess of \u20ac3.3 million including a write off of \u20ac680,000 with the balance being deferred and ultimately repayable from success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price.\nOversubscribed private placement at 10.0p raising approximately \u20ac2.0 million (\u00a31.7 million) with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5 million (\u00a30.4 million) from the exercise of warrants during the period.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at Clontibret covering ca 2,000 metres commenced in November with the planned holes aiming to follow on the gold and antimony plunge trends at Clontibret identified during the detailed relogging project.\nNet assets of the group were \u20ac22,407,969 as at 30 November 2025 and the group made a profit for the six-month period of \u20ac278,636 after the effects of the debt write off.\nJohn Sherman, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe balance sheet repair delivered during the reporting period, including fundraisings involving both new and existing shareholders, is allowing the Company to purposefully advance its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at the Clontibret gold deposit commenced at the end of the reporting period; the work aims to assess the potential for higher-grade structurally controlled gold mineralization at depth to expand the deposit, as well as testing the antimony-bearing lode system for its potential contribution to project economics.\nI look forward to seeing the initial results of this work by the end of the current calendar quarter.\"\nAbout the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d Project\nConroy Gold\u2019s \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project in Ireland is defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100% held under license by the Company, and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit.\nThe Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions.\nThe Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest.\nGold occurs in multiple styles in the Company\u2019s license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit. There are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs\u201d targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel: +353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel: +44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-203-764 2341\nTel: +44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel: +353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\nChairman\u2019s statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI present your Company\u2019s Half-Yearly Report and Condensed Financial Statements for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025.\nThe critical action for the Company in the period was the repair to its balance sheet through two steps as follows:\n1) in late August 2025 when the share price was 5.3p, the Company entered into an agreement with certain current and former directors (\u201cthe Participants\u201d) to restructure amounts owed to them (in excess of \u20ac3.3M) into success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price; and 2) in October 2025, the Company closed an\noversubscribed private placement at 10p raising \u20ac2.0M (c. \u00a31.7M), with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5M (c. \u00a30.4M) coming from the exercise of 12-month warrants at 9.5p issued as part of the Company\u2019s October 2024 fundraising.\nFurther details on these two steps are in my letter sent to shareholders dated 26 November 2025 along with the Company\u2019s Annual Report for 2025.\nTo close my comments on this action, I was pleased to see shareholders vote at the AGM in December to approve the August agreement with near unanimity, allowing the Company to have a clear focus on the futur",

The project has effectively been dormant for more than a decade because they haven't had the financials to expand the program. What has changed is that with these new investors on board they do. The balance sheet has been fixed, debts cleared, they banked \u00a32.1m cash. That will go a significant distance to expanding the resource. Starting with current drill program. Gamechanger now is they are able to drill at depth. Based on everything we know about the high grades closer to surface, and geological similarities with other significant finds globally, there is massive potential here nowhere near reflected in today's market cap. Suspect this is why they have so much support from the Canadian heavy hitters. As company themselves say, Clontibret has \"potential for multi-million-ounce gold mineralisation at depth\". Multi million.",

It is very rare to see an explorer anywhere in the world with this kind of resource at a market cap this low. The other dynamic that will significantly move the needle here is well known names in North American mining getting on board including Haywood's investment manager buying a stake. Then there's Eric Sprott putting money into Galantas which owns a dormant mine north of the border that now looks set to be coming back into production. Irish gold is having a genuine moment.",

I jumped back in pre the JV with Demir, again expecting a good profit and got trapped again as that fell apart. I recently sold 2/3 of my holding and if my next order hits I'll be out, I've  grown tired of the glacial movement here.

If you read ANY of my past posts, you will see my claim, unlike our friend DS,  that 0.5M is not to be sneezed at, not at $2k/oz, not at $3k/oz and certainly not at $5k/oz.  Ms Moroney's deep high grade concept will be the make-or-break, however. If anything has kept my interest, it's been her previous input. As you are so in management's pocket as you claim, how about asking them to release more timely updates on drilling results, like a time line for metres and assay results? Comparable companies at this make-or-break stage bombard the market with technical updates on an almost weekly basis. Rigs operating, metres drilled, assays as they come in. Rigs can easily drill 25-35m a day, that's 500m a fortnight, and assays can be turned around in under a week if the lab is down the road.",

The first hole will be 500m. I think the other 2 might be less than that. As for double digit grams over double digit metres that would obviously be good. Even grades of half that would be something though if the widths are good. It would prove that Clontibret is much bigger than 500k oz.",

While the geology is in the hands of the gods, knowing how many, how deep and where the holes are going might inspire some confidence that it's not going to be a Demir repeat. Look at any Canadian company which has to issue detailed 43-101 technical reports. CGNR has never even provided as much as a map or section. I can't imaging the likes of Mr Ryan are thrilled with the current setup, unless they are being told what we are not.",

They are doing the kind of drilling that should have been done by Demir. I think the main contribution of Demir was to set the project back by about 4-5 years. The question is whether you believe that they are going to find more gold? If gold extends below 250m and the grades are decent then that's going to significantly increase the resource. There is also the antimony. How significant is that going to be for the economics of Clontibret? What do you believe Goldbug? Do you think this new drilling is going to prove that Clontibret is more valuable or not?",

Still, only just over a month to the next PDAC jamboree where a row of new suitors are already being lined up I'm sure. Is it too much to ask for some leadership and for the Chair to come out with a clear and bold statement of objectives, plans and a timeline?

Everybody that knows anything about this company knows what a piece of scum you are. How many years have you spent saying that cgnr have nothing and it's all a big con. You are a total moron.

There are very few projects showing real grades so eyes will be on CGNR if the assays look good. If continuity at depth is confirmed Sb becomes a serious value driver here, maybe as much as the gold.

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

The balance sheet has been fixed, debts cleared, they banked \u00a32.1m cash. That will go a significant distance to expanding the resource. Starting with current drill program. Gamechanger now is they are able to drill at depth. Based on everything we know about the high grades closer to surface, and geological similarities with other significant finds globally, there is massive potential here nowhere near reflected in today's market cap. Suspect this is why they have so much support from the Canadian heavy hitters. As company themselves say, Clontibret has \"potential for multi-million-ounce gold mineralisation at depth\".

The mineralization is similar in nature to the orogenic gold found at Fosterville. But everyone wants to find another Fosterville, the highest-grade gold mine in the world. I am impressed with the quality of their technical people and especially with their newly updated corporate presentation. I highly suggest any potential investor pay attention to it.

Comparable companies at this make-or-break stage bombard the market with technical updates on an almost weekly basis. Rigs operating, metres drilled, assays as they come in. Rigs can easily drill 25-35m a day, that's 500m a fortnight, and assays can be turned around in under a week if the lab is down the road.",

It's not all down to the locals hoping to score big on land sales and jobs. The hope here has to be that grades sufficient to justify underground costs and too deep for an open pit are found in this next drilling round, because a massive low-grade open pit is problematic. The issues with low-grades are the enormous volume of tailings, and open pits, the large volume of waste rock generated. Both require unsightly, land-hungry surface disposal, and will be rich in pyrite, arsenic and other nasties, prone to AMD. Nearby massive gypsum pits and limestone quarries cited as precedents don't have these issues! Bear in mind, Dalradian's plan is all undergound at 13-15g/t and still ran into problems. Better to face the issues and work around them than stick your fingers in your ears and whistle, as you seem to be doing. Pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't make it go away.

Anyone, including the usual green suspects and their barristers in far-away leafy Dublin suburbs, can throw spanners in the works. Ireland has history here! It's not all down to the locals hoping to score big on land sales and jobs. The hope here has to be that grades sufficient to justify underground costs and too deep for an open pit are found in this next drilling round, because a massive low-grade open pit is problematic. The issues with low-grades are the enormous volume of tailings, and open pits, the large volume of waste rock generated. Both require unsightly, land-hungry surface disposal, and will be rich in pyrite, arsenic and other nasties, prone to AMD. Nearby massive gypsum pits and limestone quarries cited as precedents don't have these issues! Bear in mind, Dalradian's plan is all undergound at 13-15g/t and still ran into problems. Better to face the issues and work around them than stick your fingers in your ears and whistle, as you seem to be doing. Pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't make it go away.

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

Then you look at the links here. Conroy own land in area surrounding that mine. Conroy's gold is on same geological fault line. And south of the border, as we know Conrory have a significant amount gold in the ground - hundreds of thousands of ounces - more gold than the Ocean Partners property. Once that gold is dug up, the Ocean Partners property could provide the processing facilities. The more you look, the more links and synergies you find. I'd say some form of M&A is nailed on here.",

Where it gets more interesting is if you look at some of the deals Haywood have overseen. Canadian Nickel Company was one, that's seen blockbuster returns as Canadian government took a big stake in it. And most recently Galantas Gold. Galantas links to Conroy probably go without saying, both geologically and as the only other listed name in Irish gold. Galantas has seen spectacular gains this year with a deal brokered by none other than Haywood.",

The balance sheet has been fixed, debts cleared, they banked \u00a32.1m cash. That will go a significant distance to expanding the resource. Starting with current drill program. Gamechanger now is they are able to drill at depth. Based on everything we know about the high grades closer to surface, and geological similarities with other significant finds globally, there is massive potential here nowhere near reflected in today's market cap. Suspect this is why they have so much support from the Canadian heavy hitters. As company themselves say, Clontibret has \"potential for multi-million-ounce gold mineralisation at depth\".

Ms Moroney's deep high grade concept will be the make-or-break, however. If anything has kept my interest, it's been her previous input. As you are so in management's pocket as you claim, how about asking them to release more timely updates on drilling results, like a time line for metres and assay results? Comparable companies at this make-or-break stage bombard the market with technical updates on an almost weekly basis. Rigs operating, metres drilled, assays as they come in. Rigs can easily drill 25-35m a day, that's 500m a fortnight, and assays can be turned around in under a week if the lab is down the road.",

They drilled multiple other prospects with no material results, and Clay Lake which was too low grade. Therefore no progress with development, they walked.

There is also the antimony. How significant is that going to be for the economics of Clontibret? What do you believe Goldbug?

          "content": "Anyone spotted today's gold price? Anyone? US$4,920 per ounce! Now, consider the brutal, beautiful irony of Conroy Gold (CGNR). While the world watches that number flash, this company holds a JORC-backed 517,000 ounces of that exact asset. And when you run the math, a staggering US$2.54 billion of in-situ gold is spat out. Now, here\u2019s the punchline that should stop you cold: the market is valuing the entire company at \u00a311.5 million (16p per share)! Let\u2019s sit with that disconnect for a second. The market is essentially pricing their gold at US$28 an ounce. That\u2019s not a discount; it\u2019s a cognitive breakdown. This is the precise, fleeting anomaly that defines the early innings of a resource bull market \u2014 where reality hasn't yet caught up to the price on the screen. So, what\u2019s a sane valuation? Applying a skeletal, risk-heavy metric of just US$50 per resource ounce \u2014 a 99% discount to spot \u2014values their current resource at over US$25 million. That\u2019s the conservative floor, and we\u2019ve already blown past the current cap. Factor in the multi-million-ounce targets, the drills turning right now, and the \u00a32 million+ fuel in the tank, and a re-rate to \u00a350-80 million isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s simply arithmetic catching up. BOTTOM LINE: In a world of US$4,920 gold, owning a slice of a proven US$2.5 billion deposit for a microscopic \u00a311.5 million valuation isn't an investment \u2014 it's a logical inevitability waiting to happen. The market will close this gap; it's only a matter of when. ATB .",

They are investing in Irish gold in a big way - worth looking how many millions they spent to acquire majority stake in Galantas' Irish property - while Galantas plc are pivoting towards Chile. https://galantas.com/news/galantas-gold-closes-transaction-to-form-joint-venture-with-ocean-partners-uk-limited-to-develop-omagh-gold-project-in-northern/ The fact these guys are pouring big cash into renovating that mine north of the border is telling.  Then you look at the links here. Conroy own land in area surrounding that mine. Conroy's gold is on same geological fault line. And south of the border, as we know Conrory have a significant amount gold in the ground - hundreds of thousands of ounces - more gold than the Ocean Partners property. Once that gold is dug up, the Ocean Partners property could provide the processing facilities. The more you look, the more links and synergies you find. I'd say some form of M&A is nailed on here.",

He is investment manager at Haywood, big players in Canadian mining equity deals https://www.haywood.com/ So a pretty big name to have bought into a micro cap like this. Where it gets more interesting is if you look at some of the deals Haywood have overseen. Canadian Nickel Company was one, that's seen blockbuster returns as Canadian government took a big stake in it. And most recently Galantas Gold. Galantas links to Conroy probably go without saying, both geologically and as the only other listed name in Irish gold. Galantas has seen spectacular gains this year with a deal brokered by none other than Haywood.",

In 1984 he made the headlines when he flew a light aircraft under the arches of the Eiffel Tower.
