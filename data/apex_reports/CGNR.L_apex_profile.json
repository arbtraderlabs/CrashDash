Details of these can be found below and a full copy of the interim results statement can be viewed on the Company\u2019s website.\nHighlights:\nRestructuring completed in relation to amounts owing to Directors and former Directors in excess of \u20ac3.3 million including a write off of \u20ac680,000 with the balance being deferred and ultimately repayable from success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price.\nOversubscribed private placement at 10.0p raising approximately \u20ac2.0 million (\u00a31.7 million) with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5 million (\u00a30.4 million) from the exercise of warrants during the period.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at Clontibret covering ca 2,000 metres commenced in November with the planned holes aiming to follow on the gold and antimony plunge trends at Clontibret identified during the detailed relogging project.\nNet assets of the group were \u20ac22,407,969 as at 30 November 2025 and the group made a profit for the six-month period of \u20ac278,636 after the effects of the debt write off.\nJohn Sherman, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe balance sheet repair delivered during the reporting period, including fundraisings involving both new and existing shareholders, is allowing the Company to purposefully advance its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at the Clontibret gold deposit commenced at the end of the reporting period; the work aims to assess the potential for higher-grade structurally controlled gold mineralization at depth to expand the deposit, as well as testing the antimony-bearing lode system for its potential contribution to project economics.\nI look forward to seeing the initial results of this work by the end of the current calendar quarter.\"\nAbout the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d Project\nConroy Gold\u2019s \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project in Ireland is defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100% held under license by the Company, and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit.\nThe Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions.\nThe Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest.\nGold occurs in multiple styles in the Company\u2019s license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit. There are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs\u201d targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel: +353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel: +44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-203-764 2341\nTel: +44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel: +353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\nChairman\u2019s statement\nDear Shareholder,\nI present your Company\u2019s Half-Yearly Report and Condensed Financial Statements for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025.\nThe critical action for the Company in the period was the repair to its balance sheet through two steps as follows:\n1) in late August 2025 when the share price was 5.3p, the Company entered into an agreement with certain current and former directors (\u201cthe Participants\u201d) to restructure amounts owed to them (in excess of \u20ac3.3M) into success-based instruments tied to commercial production and a material increase in the share price; and 2) in October 2025, the Company closed an\noversubscribed private placement at 10p raising \u20ac2.0M (c. \u00a31.7M), with a further inflow of \u20ac0.5M (c. \u00a30.4M) coming from the exercise of 12-month warrants at 9.5p issued as part of the Company\u2019s October 2024 fundraising.\nFurther details on these two steps are in my letter sent to shareholders dated 26 November 2025 along with the Company\u2019s Annual Report for 2025.\nTo close my comments on this action, I was pleased to see shareholders vote at the AGM in December to approve the August agreement with near unanimity, allowing the Company to have a clear focus on the future and a significantly approved balance sheet.\nThe strengthened financial base is allowing the Company to purposefully advance its \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project that covers two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over 90km and 100% under license by the Company.\nDuring the reporting period, the geologist team prepared for the next phase of in-ground investment in the \u201cDiscs\u201d project, supplementing the knowledge gained from the ongoing re-logging and deposit modelling effort with insights from new field work.\nThe geologists have also supported the executive team in discussions with potential strategic and financial partners, with their help underpinning the success of the fundraising in the period.\nThe first phase of a new drilling programme at Clontibret covering c. 2,000 metres commenced coincident with the close of the reporting period.\nThe planned holes aim to follow on the gold and antimony plunge trends at Clontibret identified during the detailed relogging project, as initially announced on 27 February 2025:\nThe first hole underway targets the major stockwork zone beneath the historic Tullybuck antimony mine at approximately 500 metres vertical depth, while intersecting more than ten identified lodes before reaching the stockwork.\nThe hole\u2019s objectives are to enhance the geological understanding of the system and assess the potential for higher-grade, structurally controlled mineralization at depth to expand the deposit.\nIt will represent the deepest drilling undertaken at Clontibret to date.\nThe second and third drill holes in the plan will test the strike extension of the antimony-bearing lode system toward a postulated northern fault zone believed to separate the Corcaskea mineralization from the main Clontibret deposit. The holes will also test several of the central gold lodes.\nThe Company secured the services of a second drill rig in December, so the first of these antimony-focused holes is underway.\nLater phases of the programme will look beyond Clontibret to build out the Company\u2019s understanding of the Clay Lake and Creenkill target areas.\nThe aim of this work is to support our ongoing effort to bring further investment in the \u201cDiscs\u201d project to develop and deliver a successful gold mine in a manner that protects and materially increases the per share value of your investment in your Company.\nFinance\nThe profit after taxation for the half year end 30 November 2025 was \u20ac278,636 (30 November 2024: loss of \u20ac238,578) and the net assets as at 30 November 2025 were \u20ac22,407,969 (30 November 2024:\n\u20ac20,898,161).\nThe provisions of the Participants\u2019 debt restructuring agreement had two non-cash impacts on the financial statements in the period.\nThe Participants agreement to immediately write-off 20% of the amount owed to them, this being \u20ac687,260, led to the reversal of a \u20ac401,1477 expense accrual on the profit and loss statement, boosting equity, and reducing intangible assets by \u20ac286,083. The effect on the intangible asset balance is an output of the Company\u2019s accounting policy to capitalise a portion of the executive salary expense as an investment in exploration assets.\nFurthermore, the Directors agreed not to seek repayment of the remaining 80% of amounts owed to them before 30 November 2026, thereby re-classifying this debt as a long-term liability.\nShareholder approval of the Director debt restructuring agreement in December will have further non-cash effects on the financial statements in the second half of this financial year.\nThe effects will be a function of: 1) the conversion of the 80% remainder of the Director debt into a capped Net Smelter Royalty (\u201cNSR\u201d); and 2) the issuance of 30p seven-year options to the agreement\u2019s participants.\nThe Company intends to finalise the issue of the Options and the granting of the NSR in the near term and a further announcement will be made by the Company.\nDirectors and staff\nI would like to thank my fellow directors, staff and consultants for their ongoing support and dedication, which has allowed the Company to move forward on its efforts to advance the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d project with its ultimate purpose of delivering a world-class gold mine.\nOutlook\nThe Company expects initial results from the first round of drill holes in the second half of the first calendar quarter, which will yield information on the Clontibret deposit\u2019s resource potential to expand in size at depth, as well as on the potential for antimony to contribute to project economics.\nOnce the drilling of the first two holes is complete, the Company intends to progress to drill the remaining holes in the first phase programme at Clontibret.\nI thank you for your support,\nYours faithfully,\n___________________\nJohn Sherman\nChairman\n30 January 2026\nCondensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income\nfor the

During the six-month period ended 30 November 2025 no warrants expired.\nOther reserve\nThe other reserve comprises of the equity portion of convertible loans and the gain on fair valuing of the net smelter royalty set out in Note 6.\nIt also includes the cumulative translation adjustment representing the foreign exchange differences on translating the financial statements of Conroy Gold Armagh from their functional currency to the group reporting currency.\nRetained deficit\nThis reserve represents the accumulated losses absorbed by the Company to the condensed consolidated statement of financial position date.\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNotes\nto and forming part of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025\nAccounting policies\nReporting entity\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025 comprise the condensed financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the \u201cGroup\u201d).\nBasis of preparation and statement of compliance\nBasis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (\u201cIAS\u201d) 34:\nInterim Financial Reporting\n.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 May 2025, which are available on the Group\u2019s website -\nwww.conroygold.com\n. The accounting policies adopted in the presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group\u2019s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2025.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value at each reporting date.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (\u201c\u20ac\u201d). \u20ac is the functional currency of the Group.\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s subsidiary \u201cConroy Gold (Armagh) Limited\u201d was changed on 1\nst\nJune 2025 to Sterling to reflect the regulatory and tax environment within which the company operates in Northern Ireland.\nThe interim financial statements reflect amendments required with effect from that date.\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Board of Directors and management to use judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the financial period in which the estimate is revised and in any future financial periods affected. Details of critical judgements are disclosed in the accounting policies detailed in the annual consolidated financial statements.\nThe financial information presented herein does not amount to statutory consolidated financial statements that are required by Chapter 4 part 6 of the Companies Act 2014 to be annexed to the annual return of the Company. The statutory consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 May 2025 will be annexed to the annual return and filed with the Registrar of Companies. The audit report on those consolidated financial statements was unqualified.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 30 January 2026.\nGoing concern\nThe Group recorded profit of\n\u20ac\n278,636 for the six-month period ended 30 November 2025 (30 November 2024: loss of \u20ac238,578). The Group had net current assets of\n\u20ac\n1,229,326 at that date (30 November 2024: net current liabilities of \u20ac3,674,672).\nThe Board of Directors have considered carefully the financial position of the Group and in that context, have prepared and reviewed cash flow forecasts for the period to 28 February 2027. In reviewing the proposed work programme for exploration and evaluation assets, the results obtained from the exploration programme, the write of and deferral of amounts owing to certain directors and former directors (detailed in Note 5) and the prospects for raising additional funds as required, the Board of Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Conroy Gold and Natural Resources plc and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Group is exposed to or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its control over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Intra-Group balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognises investment in subsidiaries at cost less impairment.\nChange in accounting policy\nThe Group did not have any changes to its accounting policies from those applied in the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 May 2025.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published and endorsed by the EU that are not mandatory for 31 May 2025 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Company.\nThe Board of Directors does not consider that those of the below that will be effective for the year ended 31 May 2026 will have a material effect on the financial statements and they are considering whether or not those that become effective in the following financial year will have any impact on the financial statements.\nAmendments to IAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2025;\nAmendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 17 regarding supplier finance arrangements \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2025;\nAmendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 regarding classification and measurement of financial instruments \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2026;\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards \u2013 Volume 11 \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2026;\nThe following new standards and amendments to standards have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but have not yet been endorsed by the EU, accordingly, none of these standards have been applied in the current year. The Board of Directors is currently assessing whether these standards if endorsed by the EU will have any impact on the financial statements of the Company.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2027;\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures \u2013 Effective date 1 January 2027;\nAmendments to SASB standards regarding enhancement of their international applicability;\nLoss per share\nBasic earnings per share\nSix-month period ended 30 November 2025\n(Unaudited)\n\u20ac\nSix-month period ended 30 November 2024 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\nYear ended 31 May 2025\n(Audited)\n\u20ac\nProfit / (loss) for the financial period/year attributable to equity holders of the Company\n278,636\n(238,578)\n(633,394)\nNumber of ordinary shares at start of financial period/year\n55,104,175\n47,848,693\n47,848,693\nNumber of ordinary shares issued during the financial period/year\n21,845,258\n7,255,482\n7,255,482\nNumber of ordinary shares at end of financial period/year\n76,949,433\n55,104,175\n55,104,175\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share\n60,138,301\n49,881,823\n52,500,153\nBasic profit / (loss) per ordinary share\n0.0046\n(0.0048)\n(0.0121)\nDiluted profit / (loss) per share\nThe effect of share warrants is anti-dilutive.\nSubsidiaries\nCarrying value of investment in 100% owned subsidiary companies\n30 November 2025 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\n30 November 2024 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\n31 May 2025\n(Audited)\n\u20ac\nConroy Gold (Longford \u2013 Down) Limited\n9,116,824\n9,116,824\n9,116,824\nConroy Gold (Clontibret) Limited\n5,766,902\n5,766,902\n5,766,902\nConroy Gold (Armagh) Limited\n3,719,358\n3,719,358\n3,719,358\nConroy Gold Limited\n1\n1\n1\nArmagh Gold Limited\n3\n3\n3\n18,603,088\n18,603,088\n18,603,088\nThe registered office of the above subsidiaries is Shannon Airport House, Shannon Free Zone, Shannon, County Clare, V14 E370, Ireland.\nIntangible Assets\nExploration and evaluation assets\nCost\n30 November 2025 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\n30 November 2024 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\n31 May 2025\n(Audited)\n\u20ac\nAt 1 June\n29,059,493\n28,405,738\n28,405,738\nExpenditure during the financial period/year\nExpenditure\n391,951\n331,819\n653,755\nForeign currency adjustment\n(210,458)\n-\n-\nWrite-back of certain capitalised expenses\n(286,083)\n-\n-\nAt 30 November/31 May\n28,954,903\n28,737,557\n29,059,493\nExploration and evaluation assets relate to expenditure incurred in the development of mineral exploration opportunities. These assets are carried at historical cost and have been assessed for impairment in particular with regard to the requirements of IFRS 6:\nExploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\nrelating to remaining licence or claim terms, likelihood of renewal, likelihood of further expenditure, possible discontinuation of activities as a result of specific claims and available data which may suggest that the recoverable value of an exploration and evaluation asset is less than its carrying amount.\nThe Board of Directors have considered the proposed work programmes for the underlying mineral resources. They are satisfied that there are no indications of impairment.\nThe Board of Directors note that the realisation of the intangible assets is dependent on further successful development and ultimate production of the mineral resources and the availability of sufficient finance to bring the resources to economic maturity and profitability.\nExploration and evaluation costs include a reduction to the capitalised value of operating costs as a result of the write off in amounts owing set out in Note 5.\nIn addition to this, the change in the functional currency of Conroy Gold (Armagh) Limited to Sterling has resulted in a reduction in the value of intangible assets caused by exchange rate differences on the opening value of intangible assets over the six-month period.\nNon-current liabilities\nOther creditors\nCost\n30 November 2025 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\n30 November 2024 (Unaudited)\n\u20ac\n31 May 2025\n(Audited)\n\u20ac\nDeferred amounts owing to Directors/Former Directors\n2,749,037\n-\n-\nNet Smelter Royalty\n4,501,410\n4,501,410\n4,501,410\nAt 30 November/31 May\n7,250,447\n4,501,410\n4,501,410\nDeferred amounts owing to Directors and former Directors\nOn 28\nth\nAugust 2025, the Group announced that it had signed an agreement with certain past and current directors (or their representatives in the case of a deceased former Director) (the \u201cParticipants\u201d), to restructure amounts owed to them by the Group in respect of accrued fees and other emoluments into an entitlement that links payment of those amounts to commercial production and a material increase in the Group\u2019s share price.\nOn the date of signature of the agreement by the Participants, 20% of the overall balance owed to the Participants was written off amounting to \u20ac687,260 and the remaining balance of \u20ac2,749,037 was initially deferred until post 30 November 2026 and subsequently, on ratification post period end by the shareholders at the Group\u2019s annual general meeting on 17\nth\nDecember 2025, the amounts were deferred for a minimum of 4 years, and can only be repaid through a net smelter royalty from commercial production.\nThis amount has been re-classified as a non-current liability on this basis.\nThe amount of \u20ac687,260 was split with \u20ac401,177 being treated an exceptional item of income and \u20ac286,083 being treated as a reduction in intangible assets to reflect the historic capitalisation of a portion of executive salaries.\nNet Smelter Royalty\nUnder the terms of the joint venture and related agreements entered into between the Company and Demir Export on 31 December 2021, in return for fulfilling funding and other obligations as set out in the agreements, Demir Export made investments in the following wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company: Conroy Gold (Clontibret) Limited, Conroy Gold (Longford Down) Limited and Conroy Gold (Armagh) Limited.\nThe investment by Demir Export was effected by the issuance of convertible shares in each subsidiary company. Amounts invested by Demir Export were treated as a non-controlling interest in each year from financial year ending 31 May 2022.\nOn 29 April 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement with Demir Export that resulted in Demir Export exiting the joint venture.\nAt the time of their exit, Demir Export had invested a total of \u20ac5,657,671 in the subsidiary companies covered by the joint venture which was accounted for as a non-controlling interest.\nAs a result of the joint venture exit, Demir transferred all convertible shares to the Company with the consideration being the granting by the Company of a net smelter royalty interest payable from future production.\nThe net smelter royalty is calculated at a rate of 2% payable from commercial production of minerals from the joint venture licences.\nThe royalty payment will be made from the first mine or mines that are brought into production however the total payment under the net smelter royalty is capped at the total amount invested by Demir Export of \u20ac5,657,671.\nThis transaction was treated as an asset acquisition under IFRS 3 with the value of the intangible assets acquired being equal to the investment into the subsidiary companies by Demir Export of \u20ac5,657,671 and the consideration paid being the granting of the Net Smelter Royalty to Demir Export which is capped at the amount of the investment.\nThis liability is carried as a non-current liability under other creditors as it will only become payable when a fully permitted mine is brought into production in one or more of the Group\u2019s licences.\nAn obligation has been recognised given that it is considered probable by the Directors that one of the groups exploration and evaluation assets will be commercially developed.\nThe fair value of the Net Smelter Royalty Liability as at 29 April 2024 (being the date of the transaction) was calculated at \u20ac4,501,410 in accordance with the Group\u2019s accounting policies as set out in Note 1.\nThe resultant difference between this and the value of the non-controlling interest of \u20ac5,657,671 resulted in a gain of \u20ac1,156,261 being recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity and recorded as an increase in other reserves on the Group\u2019s Statement of Financial Position in the consolidated financial statements to 31 May 2024 in accordance with IFRS 10.\nThe fair value of the liability was considered at this period end in the context of any potential changes in underlying assumptions and no amendment made as any relevant changes were immaterial.\nWarrant Liability\nThe Company holds Sterling based warrants. The Company estimates the fair value of the sterling-based warrants using the Black Scholes Model. The determination of the fair value of the warrants is affected by the Company\u2019s share price at the reporting date and share price volatility along with other assumptions.\nThe fair value of all warrants in issue at 30 November 2025 was \u20ac526,703 and the movement in fair value of the warrants in the six-month period to 30 November 2025 resulted in a non-cash gain of \u20ac151,635.\nWarrants in issue include 17,287,000 warrants issued as part of the share issue on 8 October 2025 whereby one ordinary share could be acquired for each warrant held at an exercise price of GBP 17 pence.\nThese warrants are valued at \u20ac497,751 at 30 November 2025 and expire in October 2027.\n3,092,592 warrants to acquire one ordinary share each at an exercise price of GBP 22.5 pence, issued in June 2023 will expire in June 2026.\nThey are valued at \u20ac28,292 and have not been deemed sufficiently material to classify as a current liability.\nCommitments and contingencies\nExploration and evaluation activities\nThe Group has received prospecting licences under the Republic of Ireland Mineral Development Acts 1940 to 1995 for areas in Monaghan and Cavan. It has also received licences in Northern Ireland for areas in Armagh in accordance with the Mineral Development Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. At 30 November 2025, the Group had work commitments of \u20ac120,000 for the year to 30 November 2026 in respect of these licences.\nThe Group also hold prospecting license in Finland which are currently under application for extending, however there are no work or financial commitments in respect of these licenses as at 30 November 2025.\nSubsequent events\nThere were no material events subsequent to the reporting date which necessitate revision of the figures or disclosures included in the financial statements.\nRelated party transactions\n(a)\nApart from Directors\u2019 remuneration and participation in the re-structuring detailed in Note 5, there have been no contracts or arrangements entered into during the six-month period in which a Director of the Group had a material interest.\n(b)\nThe Group has an equity interest of 5,000,000 ordinary shares in Karelian Diamond Resources plc (\u201cKarelian\u201d) and entered into a convertible loan note with Karelian in May 2023 which attracted an interest rate of 5% per annum, payable on the redemption or conversion of the Loan Note.\nThe Loan Note is convertible into ordinary shares at the option of the Company at any time and was for an initial term of 18 months.\nThe conversion price is at a price of 5 pence per Karelian ordinary share.\nThe Group has the right to seek conversion of the principal amount outstanding on the convertible loan note and all interest accrued at any time during the term.\nThe term of the formal loan agreement ended in November 2024. The Group has been in discussions on extending the term of the loan and the parties have agreed in principle to extend the term of the convertible loan to 30 November 2026, however this remains subject to,\ninter alia\n, finalisation of a variation agreement and any necessary regulatory approvals under the AIM Rules for Companies. The parties are also in discussions to amend the conversion price of the convertible loan note as part of the variation agreement.\n(c)\nThe Group shares accommodation and staff with Karelian which have certain common Directors and shareholders. For the six-month period ended 30 November 2025, the Group incurred costs totalling\n\u20ac\n38,756 (30 November 2024: \u20ac34,245) on behalf of Karelian. These costs were recharged to Karelian by the Group.\nThe Group was owed \u20ac115,031 by Karelian as at 30 November 2025 (30 November 2024:\n\u20ac126,592).\nApproval of the condensed consolidated financial statements\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 30 January 2026. A copy of the condensed consolidated financial statements will be available on the Group\u2019s website (\nwww.conroygold.com\n) shortly.\n4301012_0.jpeg",

The drill holes are designed to follow up on the gold and antimony plunge trends identified during the detailed re-logging project, as first announced on 27 February 2025.\nFirst Deep Drill Hole Underway\nThe first hole, now in progress, is planned to target the major stockwork zone located beneath the historic Tullybuck Antimony Mine, at approximately 500 metres vertical depth. This hole represents the deepest drilling undertaken on the Clontibret deposit to date.\nThe hole has been designed to intersect more than ten identified lodes before reaching the deeper stockwork zone target. The objective is to enhance the geological understanding of the system and assess the potential for higher-grade, structurally controlled mineralisation at depth.\nFollow-Up Drill Holes\nThe second and third drill holes will test the strike extension of the antimony-bearing lode system toward a postulated northern fault zone believed to separate the Corcaskea mineralisation from the main Clontibret deposit. The holes will also test several of the central gold lodes.\nA second drill-rig is expected to be mobilised before year-end to accelerate this portion of the programme.\nThis drill programme represents the first phase of systematic deeper exploration at Clontibret and is an important step toward evaluating the deposit's potential to host higher-grade mineralisation at depth.\nMr John Sherman, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThis initial package of drilling follows on from the insights into plunge controls at the Clontibret target gained from the re-logging effort.\nThe aim of this body of work is to begin to assess the potential for gold in the system at depth, as well the contribution of antimony to the attractiveness of Clontibret.\"\nAbout Clontibret\nClontibret lies within a major transatlantic structural corridor that extends from Canada, through Ireland, and into Scotland. Within the Irish segment of this corridor, Conroy Gold has established the foundations of two district-scale gold trends spanning more than 95 kilometres of surface gold anomalism. These trends occur entirely within the Company's 100%-owned licence area, which covers a dominant 1,000 km\u00b2 land position.\nClontibret is located in the north east of the 65 kilometre Orlock Bridge gold trend where three targets lie in the 17 kilometre section noted in the above map, the most of advanced of which is Clontibret where a 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) has been defined that remains open in multiple directions including at depth.\nThe Orlock Bridge and Skullmartin trends are hosted within an accretionary prism formed during the oblique collision of the Laurentia and Avalonia tectonic plates and the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. This geological environment comprises Ordovician and Silurian turbidite sequences including greywacke sandstones, conglomerates, siltstones, mudstones, and volcanic units-an established setting globally for significant orogenic gold deposits.\nClontibret - Geological Analogies with Fosterville (+10 Moz)\nThe Clontibret gold target exhibits several key geological features analogous to the high-grade Fosterville Gold Mine in Victoria, Australia (current endowment >10 Moz), indicating the potential for multi-million-ounce gold mineralisation at depth.\nThese analogies include:\nHost Rocks: A folded Ordovician-age turbidite package, comparable to the rock sequence hosting Fosterville's high-grade zones.\nMineralisation Style: At Clontibret gold is intimately associated with acicular arsenopyrite, and to a lesser extent pyrite, similar to the mineralogical style at Fosterville's deposit.\nThe discovery of visible gold in a quartz breccia nearby at Creenkill (with assay values of 123.0 g/t) lends credence to the possibility of high grade gold also being present in the Clontibret target.\nLate-Stage Antimony: Presence of late stibnite/antimony mineralisation, including recent float samples assaying 21.9 g/t Au with 26.4% Sb, indicating a comparable Au-As-Sb mineral system.\nAlteration Envelope: Mineralisation hosted within broad sericite / white mica alteration zones, several metres wide, and around the margins of quartz-carbonate veins.\nMineralisation controlled by brittle faulting\nCollectively, these geological characteristics highlight Clontibret as a highly prospective target with potential for significant high-grade gold mineralisation at depth.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nAbout the \"Discs of Gold\" Project\nConroy Gold's \"Discs of Gold\" project in Ireland is defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100 per cent. held under license by the Company and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit. The Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions. The Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest. Gold occurs in multiple styles in the Company's license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit.\nThere are clear geological analogies between the \"Discs of Gold\" targets and large gold deposits in Southeastern Australia and Atlantic Canada.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7469-0930\nTel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\n4281632_0.jpeg\n4281632_1.jpeg",
