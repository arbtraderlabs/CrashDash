These three gold zones include 2 metres at 2.1 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au), 1.5 metres at 3.2 g/t gold (including\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au) and 0.5 metre at 0.8 g/t Au. The first gold mineralisation was intersected at a relatively shallow down hole depth of 27.5 metres.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two style of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork. The assay results reported on today relate to the lode style mineralisation.\nThe stockwork resource also contributes to the overall contained ounces. Three previous drill holes totalling 1,053 metres in a step out drilling programme have also demonstrated, through intersections of gold in the stockwork, that the Clontibret gold deposit extends 375 metres to the north-east (announced by the Company on 18 January 2023).\nThe lode gold zone intersections between the Clontibret gold resource and the Corcaskea gold target, which were reported in the assay results from this drill hole, open up the surrounding area for further step out drilling and the probability of linking the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret resource area which are 535 metres apart.\nThe drill hole was drilled to a down hole depth of 268.5 metres at a -60 degree angle and drilled to the east (Azimuth 090).\nDrill Hole Intersections:\n\u2022\n2.0m\n@ 2.1 g/t Au from\n27.5m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 6.7g/t Au from\n28.5m\n\u2022\n1.5m\n@ 3.2 g/t Au from\n40.0m\nIncluding\n0.5m\n@ 8.3 g/t Au from\n41.0m\n\u2022\n0.5m\n@ 0.8 g/t Au from\n88.5m\n(Only intercepts of 0.3 g/t or greater are presented)\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe Board believes that these results provide further evidence of the continuity between the Clontibret gold target and the Corcaskea area, where excellent gold intersections have been recorded in trenching, including 16.5 metres at 6.5 g/t gold, and 12 metres at 4.9 g/t gold.\nThe results are also a further indication of the overall gold potential of the 65 km gold trend which the Company has discovered. Many other gold targets have been identified along the trend including, for example, the Clay Lake gold target, which has a far larger gold-in-soil target footprint than Clontibret.\nIn addition to Clontibret, the Board looks forward to demonstrating the overall potential of the gold trend, on which in the north-eastern segment alone, we have a gold exploration target of 8.8 million ounces in addition to the JORC resource of 517,000 oz gold.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377"

The programme is being carried out in association with the Company\u2019s joint venture partner, Demir Export A.?.\nThe Clay Lake gold target in\nCounty Armagh\nis one of a series of targets discovered by the Company along the 65 km (45 Mile) gold trend. A JORC resource of 517,000oz/Au has been estimated on a small part of the Clontibret gold deposit in\nCounty Monaghan\n(previously announced by the Company on\n28 July 2017\n).\nThe step out drilling programme at the Clay Lake gold target forms part of an overall assessment of the gold and base metal potential of the joint venture area. Eight holes on the Derryhennet section of the Clay Lake gold target, totalling approximately\n2,000m\n, are planned initially. Drilling is also planned in due course on other targets along the gold trend.\nThe overall Clay Lake gold target forms a single large gold-in-soil anomaly, over 200 Ha (c.500 acres) in area and is nearly 3km in length, which in places is 2km wide (as previously announced by the Company on\n28 January 2016\n). This is a much larger gold-in-soil footprint than at the Clontibret gold target. The drilling programme at Clay Lake will step out from the known gold mineralisation, where previous trenching and drilling has yielded trenching results of up to\n5m\nat 3.0g/t gold and, drilling, a continuous gold intersection of\n100m\nat 0.6g/t gold (including\n11.8m\nat 1.4g/t Au).\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cI am delighted to see drilling at the Clay Lake gold target. The initial drilling programme at Clay Lake forms part of the overall assessment of the gold trend which the Company has discovered. We are, of course, looking at an entire new gold district which contains many gold targets along the trend, including the Clontibret gold deposit, where results have been excellent including the recent drilling that demonstrated the continuity between that deposit and the Corcaskea gold target.\nI would also like to refer interested parties to the Company website where there is a map showing the location of the trend and the areas that have been identified, giving a picture of its potential and the work being undertaken.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com"

The period has been one of great progress for the Company. The Company\u2019s Joint Venture (\u201cJV\u201d) with Demir Export A.S (\u201cDemir Export\u201d) is now well underway to continue the exploration and development of the new district scale gold trend which\nConroy Gold\ndiscovered in the Longford-Down Massif in\nIreland\n.\nA new gold discovery was made post period as announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n, with visible gold and assay results of up to 123 g/t gold in quartz breccia samples during prospecting over the Company\u2019s Mines Royal (Newtownhamilton) option area in\nCounty Armagh\nin\nNorthern Ireland\n. The new discovery is potentially a transformational event for gold exploration and development in the Company\u2019s licence area and, taken in conjunction with the Company\u2019s other significant discoveries, indicates the potential for the district to become a Tier I gold area.\nTechnical Results\nTechnical results during the period and post period end included excellent drilling results. A step-out drilling programme on the stockwork demonstrated an extension of over 375 metres to the northeast of the Clontibret gold deposit and extended the bedrock gold mineralisation further outside the gold-in-soil footprint at Clontibret which has a surface area of c.125 hectares.\nThe Clontibret gold resource is known to be open in all directions and to depth and comprises two styles of gold mineralisation: (i) lodes; and (ii) stockwork.\nThree gold lodes, with grades up to 8.3 g/t over 0.5 metres, were intersected in a drill hole located approximately 200 metres to the south of the Corcaskea gold target. This has yielded significant gold intersections in trenches, including 16.5 metres of 6.5 g/t gold and 12 metres of 4.9 g/t gold. The drill hole was 70 metres north-east of the gold outcrop (5.6 g/t gold) discovery which was the crucial first step in establishing continuity between the Corcaskea gold target and the Clontibret gold deposit, on which the Company has defined a gold resou"

Monaghan\nSecond gold trend lies parallel and to the south of the Orlock Bridge Fault Zone gold trend\nNew trend covers the new gold target and the recent high grade gold discovery in\nCo. Armagh\nFive further prospecting licences applied for along the new gold trend\nConroy Gold\nand Natural Resources plc (AIM: CGNR), the gold exploration and development company focused on\nIreland\nand\nFinland\n, is pleased to announce the discovery of a new gold target in County Monaghan. This discovery, together with the recent discovery of a gold target in\nCounty Armagh\n(announced by the Company on\n22 February 2023\n), has led to the identification of a second gold trend in the Longford-Down Massif.\nAssay results from gold-in-soil sampling by the Company, on Prospecting Licence 4554 in\nCounty Monaghan\n, have yielded values greater than 10ppb Au over an area of 1.5KM by 1.1KM. Anomalies greater than 10ppb gold-in-soil in the Longford-Down Massif tend to be associated with gold-in-bedrock. This licence area also previously yielded sediment samples, which returned gold values of up to 170ppb Au, as part of the nationwide TELLUS survey.\nThe new gold discovery in\nCounty Monaghan\n, and the recently announced gold discovery in quartz breccia samples (which had assay results of up to 123.0 g/t gold) in\nCounty Armagh\n, have both been recorded along a major geological structure, the Skullmartin Fault Zone, indicating the presence of a second gold trend in the Longford-Down Massif.\nThe newly identified (24km) gold trend lies parallel to, and south of, the Orlock Bridge Fault Zone, on which the Company has made a series of gold discoveries along a 65 km gold trend.\nThe new trend, along the Skullmartin Fault Zone, links the\nCounty Monaghan\ngold discovery, as announced today, to the recent gold discovery in quartz breccia samples in\nCounty Armagh\n.\nThe Company also announces that applications for five further prospecting licences along the trend have been made by the Company.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company\u2019s technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cThe identification of a new gold trend in the Longford \u2013 Down Massif is a further step forward in relation to the very extensive new gold district discovered by the Company.\u201d\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources plc\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas/Nick Harriss\nFirst Equity Limited (Broker)\nJason Robertson\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7330-1883\nT\nel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel\n:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com"
