          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 6458P\nTechnologies New Energy PLC\n21 January 2026\n21 January 2026\nTechnologies New Energy plc\n(\"\nTNE\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\", and together with its subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings, the \"\nGroup\n\")\nAssignment of Shareholder Loans and Agreement for Settlement by Issue of Shares\nTechnologies New Energy plc (LSE: TNE), the energy transition company focused on clean energy projects to drive industrial decarbonisation and on the development of data centre infrastructure, announces that it entered into an agreement concerning the assignment of certain shareholder loan claims (the \"\nCredits\n\") previously owed by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Technologies New Energy, S.A. (\"\nTNE S.A.\n\"), to the Company (the \"\nAssignment\n\"; \"\nAssignment Agreement\n\").\nThe Company confirms that the Assignment constituted a material related party transaction for the purposes of DTR 7.3 and was, accordingly, considered and approved by the statutory directors of the Company who were deemed independent in relation to the Assignment (the \"\nIndependent Directors\n\").\nThe counterparties to the Assignment are Diverstock Investments, S.A. (\"\nDiverstock\n\") and Tranergy, Lda (\"\nTranergy\n\") (together, the \"\nCreditors\n\"). Diverstock (an entity ultimately beneficially owned and controlled by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Meneses da Silva Moura, an Executive Director, and his spouse, Maria Jo\u00e3o Matos Abreu Faria da Silva Moura) is a shareholder of the Company and a related party (as such term is defined in IFRS). Tranergy (an entity ultimately beneficially wholly-owned and controlled by Imobiliaria Gestao E Consultadoria Empresarial S.A., which in turn is wholly-owned and controlled by Alberto Jos\u00e9 Quintas Da Silva Mendes) is also a shareholder of the Company, but is not connected to Mr. Meneses and has not previously been disclosed as a related party in the Company's financial statements. Mr. Meneses recused himself from all deliberations and decision-making concerning the Assignment.\nThe shareholder loan claims (the \"\nCredits\n\") arise from supplementary and ancillary capital contributions previously made by the Creditors to TNE S.A. and total approximately \u20ac666,817 in aggregate, comprising: (i) \u20ac456,250 owed to Diverstock; and (ii) \u20ac210,567 owed to Tranergy.\nFollowing completion of the Assignment, the Credits are owed directly by the Company to the Creditors. The Independent Directors note that these liabilities were already consolidated at Group-level prior to the Assignment and therefore the Assignment does not increase the Group's overall indebtedness, but simplifies the Group's balance sheet by transferring the obligation from subsidiary level to the parent company.\nUnder the terms of the Assignment Agreement, dated 29 December 2025, the Credits may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by the allotment and issue of new ordinary shares in the Company during 2026, subject to applicable shareholder authorities and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. No ordinary shares have been allotted and issued pursuant to the Assignment as at the date of this announcement.\nThe Independent Directors consider the Assignment to be fair and reasonable from the perspective of the Company and shareholders of the Company who are not related parties, noting the benefits of reduced cash outflows and improved liquidity and financial flexibility.\nCommenting on today's announcement, Julio Perez, Chief Executive Officer of Technologies New Energy plc, said:\n\"This Assignment shows strong support from existing shareholders and confidence in increasing their ownership in the Company. Settling these liabilities in shares rather than cash is an efficient outcome that supports our growth plans and benefits all stakeholders.\"\nThis announcement is made in accordance with DTR 7.3.8R.\n- Ends -\nEnquiries:\nTechnologies New Energy plc\nJulio Perez\ninfo@tneplc.com+351 915 126 782\nBurson Buchanan\nChris Lane, Simon Compton, Abigail Gilchrist\n+44 (0)20 7466 5000\nTNE@buchanancomms.co.uk\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Power availability is emerging as the key constraint for AI growth,\nparticularly for AI workloads running on NVIDIA hardware\n, and our scalable generation capability can support the rapid rollout of high-density data centre infrastructure.\nWe are delighted to be working alongside Data District and Alcral AG on their flagship programme in Alberta. This collaboration brings together world-class industrial capability, a region rich in energy infrastructure, and demand from Tier-1\nmajor users of AI computing for facilities\ndesigned to support NVIDIA class AI workloads. It represents an exciting opportunity for TNE to deploy our tailored technical solutions, deepen our commercial footprint, and create value as projects advance into execution.\"\nCommenting on today's announcement, Carlos Caldas, Chief Executive Officer of Data District, said\n:\n\"The agreement with TNE represents a major step forward in our ambition to position Data District as a reference platform at the intersection of clean power and high-performance digital infrastructure. With TNE and Alcral AG, we are building a long-term, scalable ecosystem designed to attract world-class computing workloads and to anchor sustainable investment, employment and innovation in the region.\"\n- Ends -\nEnquiries:\nTechnologies New Energy plc\nJulio Perez, CEO\ninfo@tneplc.com+351 915 126 782\nBurson Buchanan\nChris Lane, Simon Compton, Abigail Gilchrist\n+44 (0)20 7466 5000\nTNE@buchanancomms.co.uk\nNotes to Editors:\nAbout TNE\nTechnologies New Energy plc operates within the renewable energy sector, with a core focus on energy transition, digital transformation, biofuels, green chemicals and the broader bioeconomy.\nTNE is positioned as a global provider of advanced solutions and energy projects that accelerate the energy transition and support decarbonisation objectives.

In line with this strategy, in February 2025 the Company entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of Technologies New Energy S.A., a Portuguese company operating in the renewable energy sector.\nThe acquisition was successfully completed on 30 April 2025 for a total consideration of \u00a328 million, satisfied by the issue and allotment of new ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 each at a reference price of \u00a30.20 per share.\nA description of the Group and its business activities can be found on our website at\nwww.tneplc.com\n.\nFinancial\nreview\nThe Group incurred a loss of \u20ac349,600 in the period (\u20ac96,233 for period ended 30 June 2024). The majority of expenditure during the period related to the reverse takeover transaction and the costs of maintaining the Group's listing on the London Stock Exchange. This included professional and regulatory fees connected with the Company's admission to the standard segment of the Official List of the FCA, which transitioned to the Equity Shares (Transition) category on 29 July 2024, and to trading on the Main Market. Alongside these one-off and regulatory costs, the Group also invested in advancing its proprietary biorefinery project portfolio, laying the foundations for future revenue growth.\nThe Group had a cash position of \u20ac726,037 as at 30 June 2025 (\u20ac27,638 at 30 June 2024). The Group had\na\nbasic loss per share of \u20ac0.60.\nExpenditure\nDuring the period, the Company concentrated on managing its expenditure and on its primary objective of completing the reverse takeover of Technologies New Energy S.A. Since the completion of the RTO, the Group has carefully controlled costs while also investing resources into the development of its portfolio of biorefinery projects. In parallel, management has advanced commercial discussions and generated leads with prospective clients with the aim of securing offtake agreements and strategic partnerships. These activities are designed to support future revenue growth while maintaining disciplined financial management.\nOutlook\nThe reverse takeover of Technologies New Energy S.A. by the Company marks the completion of its mission as an investment company and the start of its future as an operating company.\nOn behalf of the board of directors of the Company (the \"Board\" or \"Directors\"), I would like to take this opportunity to thank our staff and advisers for their hard work as well as our shareholders for their continued support.\nWe look forward to updating shareholders on our progress in due course.\nJos\u00e9 Meneses\nExecutive Chairman\nDIRECTORS REPORT AND STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM REPORT AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe results of the Group have been addressed above in the Chairman's statement. The total comprehensive loss for the six-month period was \u20ac349,600 in the period (\u20ac96,233 for period ended 30 June 2024).\nDirectors\nThe following directors held office during the period:\nJose Meneses, Executive Chairman\nJulio Perez, Executive Director - (Resigned as Non-Executive Director on 30 April 2025 and Reappointed as Executive Director on 27 June 2025)\nRicardo Eiras, Executive Director\nSalvador Amico, Independent Non-Executive Director\nKate Osborne, Independent Non-Executive Director\nJames Lawson-Brown, Chair, Non-Executive Director - (Resigned on 30 April 2025)\nResponsibility Statement\nThe Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\na) the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb) the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R - namely an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the condensed interim financial information, and a description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\nc) the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R - disclosure of material related parties' transactions in the first six months and any material changes therein).\nCautionary Statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to assess the Group's strategies and the potential for those strategies to succeed. The IMR should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose.\nGoing Concern\nThe Directors' assessment of going concern is detailed in Note 3.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business activities of the Group remain those detailed in the annual report and financial statements for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2024, a copy of which is available on the Company website at\nhttps://www.tneplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TNE-plc-Annual-Report-2024.pdf\n.

(\"TNE S.A.\") on 30 April 2025, TNE S.A. has been treated as the accounting acquirer under IFRS 3.\n\u00b7\nComparatives: The figures for the six months ended 30 June 2024 reflect the equity of TNE S.A. only and therefore exclude TNE plc's share capital and share premium.\n\u00b7\nCurrent period: Equity is presented using the legal capital structure of TNE plc, with TNE S.A.'s reserves carried forward.\n\u00b7\nReverse acquisition reserve: Represents the difference between the equity issued by TNE plc and the net assets of TNE S.A. at the acquisition date.\n\u00b7\nCapital contribution reserve: Arises from historical contributions made directly into TNE S.A. prior to the RTO.\n\u00b7\nRetained deficit: Includes accumulated losses of TNE S.A. and the Group's results for the current interim period, but excludes TNE plc's results for the period before 30 April 2025.\nINTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nPeriod ended\nPeriod ended\n30-Jun\n30-Jun\n2025\n2024\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash flows from operating activities\nLoss for the period\n(349,917)\n(96,233)\nFinance income\n(270)\n(154)\nOperating cash flow\n(350,187)\n(96,387)\nIncrease in inventory\n-\n(3,370)\n(Increase) /decrease in trade and other receivables\n248,610\n84,280\n(Decrease) /increase in trade and other payables\n(355,803)\n5,184\nCash generated from operations\n(457,380)\n(10,293)\nOther payments/receipts\n(34,589)\n-\nCash Flow from operating activities\n(491,969)\n-\nFinancing\n358,000\n-\nProceeds from issue of ordinary shares\n472,286\n-\nCash generated from financing activities\n830,286\nTax paid\n-\n-\nInterest income\n125\n154\nNet cash flows from operating activities\n338,442\n(10,139)\nIncrease/ (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n338,442\n(10,139)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n387,595\n37,777\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n726,037\n27,638\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial information\n1\nGeneral information\nTechnologies New Energy plc (\"TNE\" or the \"Company\") is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company's registered office is 9th Floor, 107 Cheapside, London EC2V 6DN and its registered number is 13672588.\nThe principal activity of the Company prior to 30 April 2025 was to identify and complete an acquisition within the renewable energy sector. On 30 April 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Technologies New Energy S.A. (\"TNE S.A.\"), a company incorporated in Portugal and operating in the renewable energy sector. The consideration of \u00a328 million was satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 each at a reference price of \u00a30.20 per share.\nAs a result of this acquisition, TNE has become a trading group (the \"Group\"). The Group's activities now include consultancy services for third-party clients on the design and regulatory pathway for renewable energy projects, operating and maintenance contracting services for the construction and installation of renewable energy projects, and the preparation of a proprietary portfolio of renewable energy projects based on a hybrid biorefinery technology concept from inception to ready-to-build stage.\nThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information comprises the results of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2025 and the comparative six months ended 30 June 2024 (the \"Interim Financial Information\").\n2\nBasis of preparation\nThe Interim Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. It does not include all of the information and disclosures required for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group's most recent annual financial statements. These condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are unaudited and do not constitute statutory accounts.\nThe Interim Financial Information has been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention. The financial statements are presented in euros (\"\u20ac\") and all amounts are rounded to the nearest euro, unless otherwise stated.\n3 Accounting policies\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those set out in the Group's most recent annual financial statements, except as described below. In the opinion of the Directors, the interim unaudited financial information includes all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation.\nCurrency\nFollowing the reverse takeover, the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (\"\u20ac\"), which is the functional and presentational currency of the accounting acquirer, TNE S.A. The legal parent, TNE plc, continues to have pounds sterling as its functional currency. The comparative financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2024 relates solely to TNE S.A. and is therefore presented in euros.\nGoing concern\nThe Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors have assessed the Company's ability to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group's operations are currently being financed through the issuance of new equity, and the Group remains reliant on the continuing support of existing shareholders and the expected participation of future investors.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\nTaking into account the recent capital contributions, current trading conditions, and the measures in place to secure additional funding as required, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for at least 12 months from the date of signing these Interim Financial Statements.\nThe Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Interim Financial Information continues to be prepared on a going concern basis.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries (together, the \"Group\") as at each reporting date. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of subsidiaries with those of the Group.\nAll intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\nFollowing the reverse takeover completed on 30 April 2025, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a continuation of the financial information of Technologies New Energy S.A., which is deemed to be the accounting acquirer under IFRS 3\nBusiness Combinations\n. Although Technologies New Energy plc is the legal parent, the consolidated financial statements present the results of Technologies New Energy S.A. as if it had always been the reporting entity, with the equity structure of Technologies New Energy plc reflected in the consolidated reserves.\n4\nSegmental disclosures\nIn the opinion of the Directors, the Group is organised as a single operating segment, focused on the provision of services to companies developing their energy transition strategies. This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, no separate segmental disclosures are presented.\n5 Revenue\nRevenue from consultancy and services is recognised over time according to the stage of completion, while revenue from other sales is recognised at a point in time when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer.\n6 Earnings per share\nThe basic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nBecause the Group has reported a loss for both periods presented, the effect of outstanding warrants and options is anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.\nIn accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 33 Earnings per Share, these interim results reflect the application of reverse acquisition accounting. Technologies New Energy S.A. is identified as the accounting acquirer and continuing reporting entity, while Technologies New Energy plc is the legal parent. Consequently:\n\u00b7\nThe weighted average number of ordinary shares is based on the capital structure of TNE plc.\n\u00b7\nThe comparative EPS for the six months ended 30 June 2024 has been calculated as if the 158,839,050 ordinary shares in issue immediately after completion of the reverse takeover had been in issue throughout that comparative period.\nAll EPS figures are presented in euros, consistent with the Group's presentation currency.\nBasic and diluted\nPeriod ended\n30 June\n2025\n(unaudited)\n\u20ac\nPeriod ended\n30 June\n2024\n(unaudited)\n\u20ac\nProfit attributable to owners of TNE\n(\u20ac)\n(349,600)\n(96,233)\nWeighted average number of shares\n58,613,017\n158,839,050\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (\u20ac)\n(0.60)\n(0.06)\nComparative calculation\nThese interim results reflect the application of IFRS 3 Business Combinations to the reverse takeover of Technologies New Energy plc by Technologies New Energy S.A. completed on 30 April 2025. Under reverse acquisition accounting, Technologies New Energy S.A. is identified as the accounting acquirer and therefore becomes the continuing reporting entity. However, in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share, earnings per share must be presented using the capital structure of the legal parent, Technologies New Energy plc.\nAccordingly, the comparative loss per share for the six months ended 30 June 2024 has been calculated as if the 158,839,050 ordinary shares in issue immediately after the transaction had been in issue for the entire comparative period. This presentation ensures comparability of the earnings per share figures.\n7\nShare capital\nThe Company has only one class of share, being ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 each. All ordinary shares carry equal voting rights and rank pari-passu in respect of the distribution of dividends and repayment of capital.\nAt 30 June 2025, the Company had 158,839,050 ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 each in issue, all of which were fully paid. There were no other classes of shares or securities in issue or outstanding at that date.\nMovements in issued share capital during the period were as follows:\nDate\nNumber of shares\nNominal value per share\nIssue price\nTotal nominal value (\u20ac)\nShare premium (\u20ac)\nDescription\n1 Jan 2025\n8,500,000\n\u00a30.10\n\u00a30.10\n\u20ac 993,395\n-\nOrdinary shares in issue at start of period\n30 Apr 2025\n150,339,050\n\u00a30.10\n\u00a30.20\n\u20ac 17,570,125\n\u20ac 17,570,125\nShares issued on completion of reverse takeover of Technologies New Energy S.A.\n30 Jun 2025\n158,839,050\n\u00a30.10\n-\n\u20ac 18,563,520\n\u20ac 17,570,125\nOrdinary shares in issue at period end\nFor reporting purposes, share capital and share premium are translated into euros at the balance sheet date exchange rate.\nReverse acquisition reserve\nAs a result of the reverse takeover completed on 30 April 2025, Technologies New Energy S.A. has been identified as the accounting acquirer, while Technologies New Energy plc is the legal parent. The consolidated equity structure presented reflects the legal parent's share capital and share premium. The difference between the plc's issued share capital and share premium and the historical net assets of Technologies New Energy S.A. has been recognised within a reverse acquisition reserve in equity.\n8 Events after the reporting period\nOn 3 July 2025, the Company raised gross proceeds of \u00a384,900 through a subscription for 424,500 new ordinary shares at \u00a30.20 per share.\nOn 28 August 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of Diverfuel S.A., the developer of the Diverfuel Platform, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On the same date, the Company shortened its accounting reference date from 30 April to 31 December to align with Diverfuel S.A.\nThe Directors have evaluated events subsequent to the reporting period and determined that there were no further material events requiring disclosure or adjustment to this Interim Financial Information.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
