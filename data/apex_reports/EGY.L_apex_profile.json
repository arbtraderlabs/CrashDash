PROVIDES POSITIVE OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL UPDATE\nHOUSTON\n- January 15, 2026\n-\nVAALCO Energy, Inc. (NYSE: EGY, LSE: EGY) (\"Vaalco\" or the \"Company\") today provided an operational and financial update including production and sales volumes for 2025, a successful drilling update in Gabon and Egypt, positive accounts receivables update and its increased cash at bank as of December 31, 2025.\nHighlights and Key Items:\n\u2022 Recorded full year 2025 sales volumes of approximately 22,100 working interest (\"WI\") barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"BOEPD\"), at the top of its guidance range of 20,800 to 22,200 WI BOEPD;\no\nProduced approximately 21,150 WI BOEPD for full year 2025, at the midpoint of its full year guidance range;\n\u2022 Increased cash at bank by nearly $35 million to $58.8 million at December 31, 2025, while continuing to fund Vaalco's capital programs with no draws against the Company's reserve based lending facility (\"RBL\") in the fourth quarter;\n\u2022 Continued strong collection of receivables in Egypt with all receivables now largely on a current basis;\n\u2022 Successful start to the Phase Three Drilling Program offshore Gabon;\no\nEncountered high-quality reservoir in the ET-15 well in line with initial estimates;\no\nSecond pilot hole, the ET-15P-ST1, encountered multiple sand intervals with detailed analysis and volumetric assessment underway to confirm commercial viability;\n\u2022 Confirmed Baobab Ivorian (formerly MV10) Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel (\"FPSO\") for the Baobab field remains on track to leave the Dubai dry dock in early February to sail back to Cote d'Ivoire; and\n\u2022\nCompleted successful 2025 Egyptian drilling program, which included a successful exploration well in the H-Field, Eastern Desert, that opens a new development area with an initial flow rate of approximately 450 BOEPD.\nGabon Phase Three Drilling Program Update\nVaalco's Phase three Drilling Program in Gabon commenced in the fourth quarter of 2025 with the drilling of two pilot wells in the Etame field. The first well, ET-15P, was drilled to a total depth of 2,397 meters in the western Etame-1V fault block, targeting the Gamba and encountered high-quality reservoir sands consistent with pre-drill projections. Pressure data confirmed strong communication with nearby producing wells, supporting the presence of a connected and productive reservoir system with initial estimates of between 2.4 and 3.2 million barrels of oil in place. Additionally, the well successfully evaluated the deeper Dentale formation, where good-quality, oil-bearing sands were encountered confirming the continuity of the original oil-water contact across this part of the field and further strengthening the development potential of the Etame asset. The second pilot well, ET-15P-ST1, was drilled to a depth of 2,175 meters on the western side of the main Etame fault block, also targeting the Gamba, and encountered multiple high-quality sand intervals, delivering approximately nine meters of net reservoir and four meters of net pay across two sand lobes. Detailed analysis and volumetric assessment are underway to determine future commercial viability. Vaalco is currently drilling the ET-15P, a horizontal production sidetrack, confirmed by the first pilot hole, which the Company expects to have on production later in the first quarter.\nGeorge Maxwell, Vaalco's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We completed another successful year in 2025 and have started 2026 with some positive momentum as we continue to execute on our major projects. Our track record of consistently delivering results at or above guidance continued in Q4 2025 with very strong sales and solid production performance. We repeatedly raised production and sales guidance in 2025 and continued to deliver on those increased guidance ranges. We were able to fund all cash capital expenditures, pay the quarterly dividend and raise our cash position at year-end by nearly $35 million without any draws against our RBL in Q4 2025, closing the year with a net debt position of just over $1 million. This was driven by strong sales and continued strong collection from our receivables, where all of our aged receivables are now current. We are particularly pleased with the progress our team have made in our Egyptian receivables in 2025. At the start of 2025 our outstanding Accounts Receivable for EGPC amounted to $113 million, and at year end 2025 this balance had fallen to $31 million even after invoicing over $129 million in revenue for the year. We collected over $210 million in 2025, boosted by an industry payment of $40 million received in the last week of the year. We are pleased to be working with strong partners and host nations that continue to be very positive toward capital investment in oil and gas projects.\"\n\"We are encouraged with the successful start of our Phase Three Drilling Program offshore Gabon. As planned, we have drilled two pilot holes and encountered high-quality sands in both pilot holes. The FPSO project at Cote d'Ivoire remains on schedule as we are forecasting the Baobab Ivorian to leave Dubai in early February to sail back to the Baobab field to resume production in the second quarter. As we enter 2026, with major projects underway in both Gabon and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, we are looking to continue to drive meaningful growth that we believe will translate into value for our shareholders for the remainder of the decade.\"\nAbout Vaalco\nVaalco, founded in 1985 and incorporated under the laws of Delaware, is a Houston, Texas, USA based, independent energy company with a diverse portfolio of production, development and exploration assets across Gabon, Egypt, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Canada.\nFor Further Information\nVaalco Energy, Inc.

ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2025 RESULTS\nHOUSTON\n- November 11, 2025\n-\nVAALCO Energy, Inc. (NYSE: EGY, LSE: EGY) (\"Vaalco\" or the \"Company\") today reported operational and financial results for the\nthird\nquarter of 2025.\nThird\nQuarter 2025 Highlights and Recent Key Items:\n\u2022\nReported net income of\n$1.1 million\n(\n$0.01\nper diluted share), Adjusted Net Loss(1) of\n$10.3\nmillion (\n$(0.10)\nper diluted share\n)\nand Adjusted EBITDAX(1) of $\n23.7\nmillion;\n\u2022 Produced\n15,405\nnet revenue interest (\n\"\nNRI\n\"\n)(2) barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"BOEPD\"), at the high end of guidance, or\n19,887\nworking interest (\n\"\nWI\n\"\n)(3) BOEPD, above the midpoint of guidance;\n\u2022 Sold\n12,831\nNRI BOEPD, at the high end of guidance;\n\u2022 Increased full year production and sales guidance midpoints due to strong quarterly performance that has been near the high end of guidance through the first nine months of 2025;\n\u2022 Further decreased full year capital guidance midpoint by 19% or $58 million from original 2025 guidance; and\n\u2022\nDeclared quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock to be paid on December 24, 2025.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow are Non-GAAP financial measures and are described and reconciled to the closest GAAP measure in the attached table under \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n(2) All NRI sales and production rates are Vaalco's working interest volumes less royalty volumes, where applicable.\n(3) All WI production rates and volumes are Vaalco's working interest volumes, where applicable.\nGeorge Maxwell, Vaalco's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We continue to deliver consistent quarterly results that either meet or exceed our guidance. Both our sales and NRI production for the third quarter of 2025 were above the midpoint of guidance, leading to solid financial results. We have positively adjusted our full year 2025 guidance taking into account the production and sales results through the first nine months of the year. Additionally, we have decreased the midpoint of our full year capital guidance twice this year, for a total of $58 million, all while raising full year production expectations driven by operational efficiency and well performance. We also have kept absolute production expense in line with previous guidance and with the increased sales, we are seeing a reduction on our per barrel costs against original guidance. Our track record of success in delivering results at or above expectations should provide our investors with assurance that we will execute on the portfolio of opportunities we discussed in the Capital Markets Day presentation back in May.\"\n\"We are well positioned to deliver growth as we prepare for multiple production enhancing drilling campaigns across our diversified asset base. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the FPSO refurbishment project is well underway, with the vessel at the shipyard in Dubai and we are preparing for a drilling campaign in 2026 to augment the production and economic life of the Baobab field. In Gabon, we have been waiting for the 2025/2026 drilling program to commence once the contracted rig completes its current commitments. The rig is completing its final well commitment and we expect it to arrive at Etame to begin our drilling campaign in late November. In Egypt, we continue to efficiently drill wells and the success of the program has benefitted our production results. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2025, we entered into a new reserves-based credit facility to supplement our internally-generated cash flow and cash balance to assist in funding our robust organic growth projects. Shortly after the third quarter, we successfully completed our semi-annual redetermination with the lenders and have increased their commitments on the $300 million facility from $190 million to $240 million, increasing our available liquidity. This enhances our ability to fund the significant growth and opportunities that we have planned over the next few years as we seek to drive the next phase of growth and generate meaningful value for our shareholders for the remainder of the decade.\"\nOperational Update\nGabon\nThe Company secured a drilling rig in December 2024 in conjunction with its 2025/2026 drilling program, which is expected to begin during the fourth quarter of 2025, once the drilling rig completes its current commitments. The program includes drilling multiple development wells, and appraisal or exploration wells, and perform workovers, with options to drill additional wells. Vaalco plan to drill wells at both the Etame platform and at its Seent platform, as well as a re-drill and a number of workovers in the Ebouri field to access production and reserves that were previously removed from proved reserves due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide.\nIn July 2025, the Company performed planned, staged shutdowns of the Gabon platforms to perform safety inspections and necessary maintenance to increase the integrity and reliability of the assets. This is the first full field maintenance shutdown that Vaalco has performed since the new Floating Storage and Offloading vessel (\"FSO\") was brought online in 2022. All fields were successfully brought back online and the planned turnaround was completed on budget and with no safety or environmental incidents.\nEgypt\nThe current drilling campaign in Egypt began in December 2024 and has continued through the third quarter of 2025. During the third quarter of 2025, four development wells were drilled in the Eastern Desert, of which three were completed during the same period and the fourth well was completed in October 2025. Also, during the third quarter of 2025, Vaalco drilled one exploration well in the Western Desert which was completed in October 2025. Additionally, continuous well interventions, workovers and optimization activities were carried out throughout the third quarter of 2025 to enhance production levels.\nCanada\nIn early 2025, the Company decided to defer the drilling of additional wells in Canada based on a reassessment of capital allocation priorities across the portfolio and to ensure that investment is directed toward projects with the highest expected returns. Therefore, the Canadian division is looking towards lower-cost optimization projects to enhance productivity by year-end.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nAs part of the planned dry dock refurbishment, the Baobab Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel ceased hydrocarbon production on January 31, 2025 and the final lifting of crude oil from the FPSO took place in February 2025. The vessel departed from the field in late March 2025 and arrived at the shipyard in Dubai ahead of schedule in mid-May 2025. The FPSO refurbishment is progressing well and has now been underway for the last five months in the shipyard. A rig has been secured for significant development drilling which is expected to begin in 2026 after the FPSO returns to service, potentially bringing meaningful additions to production from the main Baobab field in CI-40. The Company is also evaluating the potential future development of the Kossipo field, which is on the CI-40 license.\nEquatorial Guinea\nVaalco owns a 60% working interest in an undeveloped portion of Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea where it is the designated operator. The Company has an existing plan of development of the Venus field discovery on Block P, which focuses on key areas of drilling evaluations, facilities design, market inquiries and metocean review. Vaalco has completed the initial Front End Engineering and Design study that confirmed the viability of the development concept and is currently evaluating alternative technical solutions which may deliver enhanced economic value.\nFinancial Update\n-\nThird\nQuarter of\n2025\nVaalco reported net income of\n$1.1 million\n(\n$0.01\nper diluted share) for\nQ3 2025\nwhich was\ndown\ncompared with net income of\n$8.4 million\n(\n$0.08\nper diluted share) in\nQ2 2025\nand net income of\n$11.0 million\n(\n$0.10\nper diluted share) in\nQ3 2024\n. The\ndecrease\nin earnings compared with\nQ2 2025\nwas driven by lower realized pricing and lower sales volume in\nQ3 2025\nof\n1,180\nMBOE compared to a sales volume of\n1,765\nMBOE in\nQ2 2025\npartially offset by lower production expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\"), and lower income tax expense.\nAdjusted EBITDAX totaled\n$23.7 million\nin\nQ3 2025\n, compared with\n$49.9 million\nin\nQ2 2025\n. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized pricing and lower sales volumes partially offset by lower production expense. Adjusted EBITDAX was\ndown\nfrom\n$92.8 million\ngenerated in\nQ3 2024\nprimarily due to lower realized pricing and lower sales volumes.\nQuarterly Summary - Sales and Net Revenue\n$ in thousands\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2025\nGabon\nEgypt\nCanada\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nTotal\nGabon\nEgypt\nCanada\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nTotal\nOil Sales\n$ 24,287\n$ 58,271\n$ 3,278\n$ -\n$ 85,836\n$ 67,964\n$ 55,188\n$ 3,751\n$ 354\n$ 127,257\nNGL Sales\n-\n-\n1,418\n-\n1,418\n-\n-\n1,298\n-\n1,298\nGas Sales\n-\n-\n196\n-\n196\n-\n-\n572\n-\n572\nGross Sales\n24,287\n58,271\n4,892\n-\n87,450\n67,964\n55,188\n5,621\n354\n129,127\nSelling Costs & Carried Interest\n495\n(183)\n(187)\n-\n125\n65\n(179)\n(240)\n-\n(354)\nRoyalties & Taxes\n(3,511)\n(22,392)\n(665)\n-\n(26,568)\n(9,462)\n(21,752)\n(666)\n-\n(31,880)\nNet Revenue\n$ 21,271\n$ 35,696\n$ 4,040\n$ -\n$ 61,007\n$ 58,567\n$ 33,257\n$ 4,715\n$ 354\n$ 96,893\nOil Sales MMB (working interest)\n383\n995\n52\n-\n1,430\n1,034\n995\n62\n-\n2,091\nAverage Oil Price Received\n$ 63.46\n$ 58.40\n$ 62.75\n$ -\n$ 60.04\n$ 65.72\n$ 55.31\n$ 60.44\n$ -\n$ 60.87\nChange\n(1) %\nAverage Brent Price\n$ 69.04\n$ 68.07\nChange\n1 %\nGas Sales MMCF (working interest)\n-\n-\n429\n-\n429\n-\n-\n448\n-\n448\nAverage Gas Price Received\n-\n-\n$ 0.46\n-\n$ 0.46\n-\n-\n$ 1.28\n-\n$ 1.28\nChange\n(64) %\nAverage Aeco Price ($USD)\n-\n-\n$ 0.69\n-\n$ 0.69\n-\n-\n$ 1.35\n-\n$ 1.35\nChange\n(48) %\nNGL Sales MMB (working interest)\n-\n-\n56\n-\n56\n-\n-\n60\n-\n60\nAverage Liquids Price Received\n-\n-\n$ 25.17\n-\n$ 25.17\n-\n-\n$ 21.65\n-\n$ 21.65\nChange\n16 %\nRevenue and Sales\nQ3 2025\nQ3 2024\n% Change Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024\nQ2 2025\n% Change Q3 2025 vs. Q2 2025\nProduction (NRI BOEPD)\n15,405\n21,770\n(29) %\n16,956\n(9) %\nSales (NRI BOE)\n1,180,000\n2,134,000\n(45) %\n1,765,000\n(33) %\nRealized commodity price ($/BOE)\n$ 51.26\n$ 65.41\n(22) %\n$ 54.87\n(7) %\nCommodity (Per BOE including realized\ncommodity derivatives)\n$ 50.96\n$ 65.42\n(22) %\n$ 54.92\n(7) %\nTotal commodity sales ($MM)\n$ 61.0\n$ 140.3\n(57) %\n$ 96.9\n(37) %\nIn\nQ3 2025\n, Vaalco had a net revenue\ndecrease\nof\n$35.9 million\nor\n37%\ncompared to\nQ2 2025\nprimarily due to lower average realized price received of\n$51.26\nper BOE in\nQ3 2025\ncompared to\n$54.87\nper BOE in\nQ2 2025\n, a\ndecrease\nin the total NRI sales volumes of\n1,180\nMBOE which was\n33%\nlower\nthan the\nQ2 2025\nvolumes of\n1,765\nMBOE and was lower compared to\n2,134\nMBOE for\nQ3 2024\n.\nQ3 2025\nNRI sales were at the high end of Vaalco's guidance.

The new facility, which is subject to customary administrative conditional precedents, replaces the Company's previously undrawn revolving credit facility. The Company arranged the new facility primarily to provide short-term funding that may be needed from time-to-time to supplement its internally generated cash flow and cash balance as it executes its planned investment programs across its diversified asset base over the next few years. As of\nSeptember\u00a030, 2025\n, the Company had\n$60.0\u00a0million\noutstanding borrowings.\nEffective October 17, 2025, the Lenders unanimously approved an increase in the Company's borrowing base under the new facility from $186.6\u00a0million to $190.0\u00a0million after the Company completed its semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process. In addition, the Lenders also approved to (i) extend the first date on which the Initial Total Commitments will be reduced from September 30, 2026 to March 31, 2027, and (ii) amend the semi-annual commitment reduction amounts from $19.0\u00a0million to $10.0\u00a0million on March 31, 2027, and $22.5\u00a0million starting on September 30, 2027.\nIn addition, on November 7, 2025, subject to certain conditions precedent, certain existing lenders under the new facility agreed to increase their initial commitment effective January 23, 2026 (the \"Effective Increase Date\") so that the aggregate borrowing base under the 2025 RBL Facility as of the Effective Increase Date would increase from $190.0\u00a0million to $240.0\u00a0million. The increase in commitments was undertaken with the existing accordion feature included in the new facility.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nVaalco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock for the\nthird\nquarter of 2025 on September 19, 2025.

Where a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" \"aim,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"may,\" \"likely,\" \"plan\" and \"probably\" or similar words may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements relating to (i) estimates of future drilling, production, sales and costs of acquiring crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; (ii) expectations regarding Vaalco's ability to effectively integrate assets and properties it has acquired as a result of the Svenska acquisition into its operations; (iii) expectations regarding future exploration and the development, growth and potential of Vaalco's operations, project pipeline and investments, and schedule and anticipated benefits to be derived therefrom; (iv) expectations regarding future acquisitions, investments or divestitures; (v) expectations of future dividends; (vi) expectations of future balance sheet strength; and (vii) expectations of future equity and enterprise value.\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks relating to any unforeseen liabilities of Vaalco; the ability to generate cash flows that, along with cash on hand, will be sufficient to support operations and cash requirements; risks relating to the timing and costs of completion for scheduled maintenance of the FPSO servicing the Baobab field; and the risks described under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in Vaalco's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividends beyond the fourth quarter of\n2025\nhave not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors for Vaalco. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of the Board and will be determined based on Vaalco's financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, crude oil and natural gas prices, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. The Board reserves all powers related to the declaration and payment of dividends. Consequently, in determining the dividend to be declared and paid on Vaalco common stock, the Board may revise or terminate the payment level at any time without prior notice.\nAny forward-looking statement made by Vaalco in this press release is based only on information currently available to Vaalco and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, Vaalco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nOther Oil and Gas Advisories\nInvestors are cautioned when viewing BOEs in isolation. BOE conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalencies described above, utilizing such equivalencies may be incomplete as an indication of value.\nInside Information\nThis announcement contains inside information as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse which is part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\") and is made in accordance with the Company's obligations under article 17 of MAR.

the impact of certain non-cash and/or other items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company's performance from period to period. Management also believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors to evaluate and compare the Company's operating and financial performance across periods, as well as to facilitate comparisons to others in the Company's industry. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income, plus deferred income tax expense (benefit), unrealized derivative instrument loss (gain), bargain purchase gain on the Svenska Acquisition, FPSO demobilization, transaction costs related to the Svenska acquisition and non-cash and other items.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by Vaalco's management and by external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, lenders, rating agencies, investors and others who follow the industry. Management believes the measure is useful to investors because it is as an indicator of the Company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income, plus interest expense (income) net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense, FPSO demobilization, non-cash and other items including stock compensation expense, bargain purchase gain on the Svenska Acquisition, other operating (income) expense, net, non-cash purchase price adjustment, transaction costs related to acquisition, credit losses and other and unrealized derivative instrument loss (gain).\nManagement uses Adjusted Working Capital as a transition tool to assess the working capital position of the Company's continuing operations excluding leasing obligations because it eliminates the impact of discontinued operations as well as the impact of lease liabilities. Under the applicable lease accounting standards, lease liabilities related to assets used in joint operations include both the Company's share of expenditures as well as the share of lease expenditures which its non-operator joint venture owners' will be obligated to pay under joint operating agreements. Adjusted Working Capital is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents working capital excluding working capital attributable to discontinued operations and current liabilities associated with lease obligations.\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate financial performance and to determine the total amount of cash over a specified period available to be used in connection with returning cash to shareholders, and believes the measure is useful to investors because it provides the total amount of net cash available for returning cash to shareholders by adding cash generated from operating activities, subtracting amounts used in financing and investing activities, effects of exchange rate changes on cash and adding back amounts used for dividend payments and stock repurchases. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and adds the amounts paid under dividend distributions and share repurchases over a specified period.\nFree Cash Flow has significant limitations, including that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary purposes and should not be used as a substitute for cash flow measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as a substitute for cashflows from operating activities before discontinued operations or any other liquidity measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company's Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income have significant limitations, including that they do not reflect the Company's cash requirements for capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital or debt service. Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and operating income (loss), and the calculation of these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company's Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow.\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nJune 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNet income\n$ 1,101\n$ 10,990\n$ 8,380\n$ 17,212\n$ 46,827\nAdjustment for discrete items:\nUnrealized derivative instruments loss (gain)\n737\n(192)\n(309)\n626\n365\nBargain purchase gain\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(19,898)\nDeferred income tax benefit\n(12,171)\n(3,089)\n(5,788)\n(19,569)\n(8,551)\nNon-cash purchase price adjustment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n14,981\nTransaction costs related to acquisition\n17\n327\n34\n73\n3,402\nOther operating income, net\n-\n(102)\n-\n-\n(68)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\n$ (10,316)\n$ 7,934\n$ 2,317\n$ (1,658)\n$ 37,058\nDiluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Share\n$ (0.10)\n$ 0.08\n$ 0.02\n$ (0.02)\n$ 0.36\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding (1)\n104,283\n103,842\n103,958\n104,010\n103,728\n(1)\nNo adjustments to weighted average shares outstanding\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDAX\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nJune 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNet income\n$ 1,101\n$ 10,990\n$ 8,380\n$ 17,212\n$ 46,827\nAdd back:\nInterest expense, net\n2,333\n588\n2,572\n6,199\n2,640\nIncome tax expense\n(3,596)\n32,574\n6,983\n19,470\n64,115\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n20,555\n47,031\n28,273\n79,133\n105,987\nExploration expense\n353\n-\n2,520\n2,873\n48\nNon-cash or unusual items:\nStock-based compensation\n1,685\n1,479\n1,411\n4,448\n3,362\nUnrealized derivative instruments loss\n737\n(192)\n(309)\n626\n365\nBargain purchase gain\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(19,898)\nOther operating income, net\n-\n(102)\n-\n-\n(68)\nNon-cash purchase price adjustment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n14,981\nTransaction costs related to acquisition\n17\n327\n34\n73\n3,402\nCredit losses and other\n484\n69\n29\n485\n5,222\nAdjusted EBITDAX\n$ 23,669\n$ 92,764\n$ 49,893\n$ 130,519\n$ 226,983\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nReconciliation of Working Capital to Adjusted Working Capital\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nChange\nCurrent assets\n$ 173,738\n$ 237,927\n$ (64,189)\nCurrent liabilities\n(166,238)\n(181,728)\n15,490\nWorking capital\n7,500\n56,199\n(48,699)\nAdd: lease liabilities - current portion\n16,651\n16,895\n(244)\nAdjusted Working Capital\n$ 24,151\n$ 73,094\n$ (48,943)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nReconciliation of Free Cash Flow\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by Operating activities\n$ 67,494\nNet cash used in Investing activities\n(155,762)\nNet cash provided by Financing activities\n22,603\nEffects of exchange rate changes on cash\n53\nTotal net cash change\n(65,612)\nAdd back shareholder cash out:\nDividends paid\n19,807\nTotal cash returned to shareholders\n19,807\nFree Cash Flow\n$ (45,805)\nReconciliation of Debt to Net Debt\nNet debt, or outstanding debt obligations less cash and cash equivalents, is a non-GAAP financial measure.
