UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n6 September 2024\nDIGITAL 9 INFRASTRUCTURE PLC\n(\"D9\" or the \"Company\" and, together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\")\nCompany Update including Unaudited Portfolio Valuation and Net Asset Value\nIn preparation of the Company's interim results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"\nBoard\n\") today provides\nan\nupdate on the unaudited portfolio valuation and Net Asset Value (\"\nNAV\n\") as at 30 June 2024.\nThe recently appointed Board is undertaking a review to assess the fair value of the Group's portfolio under International Financial Reporting Standards. Whilst the valuation process is still ongoing, the Board, in conjunction with its advisers and having obtained an independent valuation on certain portfolio companies, has determined that the aggregate portfolio valuation as at 30 June 2024 is likely to be materially below the latest published portfolio valuation as at 31 December 2023.\nThe Board currently anticipates the reduction in the unaudited portfolio valuation identified from the valuation process so far would result in a provisional unaudited NAV as at 30 June 2024 of approximately\n45p per share. T\nhe Company's audited NAV as at 31 December 2023,\nas published on 30 April 2024, was 79.3p per share.\nA major part\nof the NAV reduction is attributable to a re-assessment of the assumptions relating to the availability of finance for underlying portfolio companies and its impact on portfolio companies' growth outcomes in the valuation models, as compared to those inputs used in arriving at the NAV as at 31 December 2023\n.\nThe valuation process is yet to be completed which may result in further changes. The Board expects to release the Company's interim results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2024,\nno later than 30 September 2024.\nFurther Company updates\nSale processes\nIn line with the new investment objective and investment policy approved by the Shareholders in the General Meeting held on 25 March 2024, non-binding offers for certain assets have been received and a selected number of preferred bidders have been admitted to a second phase of the sales processes, which will include detailed due diligence. Sales processes are also ongoing for various assets in the portfolio, excluding Arqiva.\nThere can be no guarantee that the sales will proceed, and the sale processes will only be progressed if the Board is satisfied that the values achieved are acceptable.\nA further update on the sales processes will be made as matters progress.\nInvestment management arrangements\nThe Board has made significant progress in its independent review of the Company's investment management arrangements and will make a further announcement upon the conclusion of the process in the near future.\nENDS.\nContacts\nDigital 9 Infrastructure plc\nEric San\nde\nrson\nvia FTI Consulting\nTriple Point Investment Management LLP\n(Investment Manager)\nDiego Massidda\nBen Beaton\nArnaud Jaguin\n+44 (0) 20 7201 8989\nD9contact@triplepoint.co.uk\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Financial Adviser)\nChris Clarke\nDarren Vickers\n+44 (0) 203 100 2000\nJ.P.
