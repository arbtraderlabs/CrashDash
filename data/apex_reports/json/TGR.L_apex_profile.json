That Resolution was withdrawn before being voted on, as the existing auditor has resigned to facilitate the appointment of a new auditor, explained below.\nDetails of the votes relating to each resolution are contained in the table below.\nRESOLUTION\nVOTES FOR\nVOTES AGAINST\nVOTES TOTAL\nVOTES WITHHELD\n1\n46,521,877\n23,311\n46,545,188\n28,423,536\n2\n74,661,027\n285,164\n74,946,191\n22,533\n3\n46,512,566\n28,433,625\n74,946,191\n22,533\n4\n46,502,784\n28,442,454\n74,945,238\n23,486\n5\n47,970,507\n26,974,731\n74,945,238\n23,486\n7\n47,932,717\n24,535\n47,957,252\n27,011,472\n8\n46,481,954\n28,434,923\n74,916,877\n51,847\n9\n46,471,206\n28,445,671\n74,916,877\n51,847\n10\n46,471,206\n28,445,671\n74,916,877\n51,847\n11\n46,418,470\n28,493,588\n74,912,058\n56,666\n12\n46,364,722\n28,548,826\n74,913,548\n55,176\n13\n46,263,488\n28,600,142\n74,863,630\n105,094\n14\n46,428,675\n28,505,339\n74,934,014\n34,710\n15\n46,422,124\n28,494,819\n74,916,943\n51,781\n16\n46,411,375\n28,505,568\n74,916,943\n51,781\n17\n46,463,841\n28,449,207\n74,913,048\n55,676\n18\n46,357,511\n28,555,537\n74,913,048\n55,676\n19\n46,354,511\n28,558,537\n74,913,048\n55,676\n20\n46,354,511\n28,558,537\n74,913,048\n55,676\n21\n46,459,862\n28,479,422\n74,939,284\n29,440\n22\n46,511,118\n28,430,149\n74,941,267\n27,457\nResolutions 15-22, which were Special Resolutions requiring a 75% majority of those voting, were not passed. These resolutions principally relate to the disapplication of pre-emption rights for the issue of new shares, required for the conversion rights under the convertible loan notes (CLNs) to be exercised. In respect of the \u00a34.5 million 2025 CLNs, the Company has in place alternative arrangements permitting the issue of the conversion shares by means of a share for share exchange involving the addition of an intermediate step in the conversion mechanics using shares in a newly incorporated Guernsey subsidiary. As a result, even though the relevant resolutions did not achieve a 75% vote, it is expected that the 2025 CLN will be able to convert to equity as originally planned. Conversion of the 2019 CLN may also be achieved by the same process. Further details of these arrangements will be made available in due course, as will the implications for the 2022 CLN for which conversion may, if needed, be undertaken in a similar way.\nChange of Auditor\nThe Audit Committee and Board have agreed that it would be beneficial to make a change in the Company's auditor. The Company is pleased to report that Moore Kingston Smith LLP, a member firm of the Moore Global network, has agreed to act as the Company's auditor. The previous auditor, Johnsons, have accordingly agreed to step down and tendered their resignation. Johnsons have provided notice under s. 519 of the Companies Act that there are no circumstances connected with their resignation to be brought to the attention of shareholders or creditors. The Board has appointed Moore to serve as auditor until the conclusion of the Company's next AGM.\nENDS\nFor further information, please visit\u202fhttps://www.tirupatigraphite.co.uk/\u202for contact:\nTirupati Graphite Plc\nMark Rollins - Executive Chairman\nAlastair Bath - Investor Relations\ninfo@tirupati.co.uk\nIR@tirupati.co.uk\n+44 7356 057 265\nAbout Tirupati Graphite\u00a0Plc\nTirupati Graphite is a specialist graphite producer and a supplier of the critical mineral for a decarbonised economy and the energy transition, with leading low development capital and operating costs.

Upon the publication of this announcement, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\n7 April 2025\nTirupati Graphite plc\n('Tirupati', or the 'Company' and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\")\nCLN Subscriptions at over \u00a32.5 million; Amended Terms,\nand Operational Update\nTirupati Graphite plc (TGR.L), the specialist flake graphite company and producer of this critical mineral for the global energy transition, is pleased to announce that subscriptions for its placing of zero-coupon Convertible Notes (\"2025 Notes\") have now surpassed \u00a32.5 million. The placing remains open for additional subscriptions until 5pm on Friday 11 April 2025. Terms of the 2025 Notes are being revised as detailed below. The Company has updated its current Investor Presentation (available at\nwww.tirupatigraphite.co.uk\n) and also provides below certain updates following its second month of restarted operations in Madagascar.\nConvertible Loan Note (\"CLN\") Fundraise and Terms Update\nThe previously announced terms for the 2025 Notes are amended as follows:\n\u00b7\nConversion price amended to 3.75 pence per ordinary share of the Company (previously 5 pence);\n\u00b7\nWarrants to be issued on conversion on a 1:1 basis revised to an exercise price of 3.75 pence per ordinary share\n; and\n\u00b7\nAccelerator option amended: in the event that the Company's share price exceeds 11.25 pence per share for a set period prior to 31 December 2025, holders of the warrants issued on conversion of the 2025 Notes who then exercise their warrants within 30 days will be granted additional warrants on a 1:2 basis, with an exercise price of 15 pence per share and a duration of 18 months (previously a trigger price of 15 pence and an exercise price of 20 pence).\nTo date, the Company has received \u00a31.56 million of the proceeds of the CLN offering, with the balance all due by 15 April 2025. As previously announced, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder, and by the Company when the conversion shares can be admitted to trading on the LSE (the \"Conversion Condition\") expected later this year, once: (i) the Company has received approval from shareholders in general meeting for the issue of the shares; (ii) listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the LSE is resumed and the present suspension is lifted, which requires filing of the 31 March 2024 annual report and audited financial statements, as well as the 30 September 2024 half year accounts; and (iii) approval of the required prospectus for issue of the new shares.\nThe Company is similarly revising the amended terms of its \u00a30.9 million 2019 Convertible Notes, reducing the conversion price of the Notes to 3.75 pence per ordinary share. As a reminder, these Notes will also convert to ordinary shares once the Conversion Condition is satisfied.The Company is progressing discussions with holders of its \u00a31.8 million 2022 Convertible Notes regarding agreement to extend the mid 2025 maturity date by one year, with a reduction in the conversion price to 10 pence per ordinary share and amended interest terms.\nProduction Update and Operational Progress\n\u00b7\nDuring March 2025, production achieved from the Vatomina project was 38\n8\nMTs of flake graphite concentrate of various grades, up to 96% purity. Production was below the planned mont\nh\nly target due to a\ncombination\nof plant\nshutdowns\nand lower than expected ore grade.\n\u00b7\nIn order to support mining of higher grade ore, g\nrade control and mine planning drilling was re-commenced in late March following\nthe return to service of the Company-owned\ndrilling rig\n.\n\u00b7\nFirst results from this drilling campaign have demonstrated encouraging higher ore grades, and indicate that daily production rates of around 25 tons per day of flake graphite concentrate at the Vatomina plant should be achievable from two\nP\nre\n-\nconcenta\ntion U\nnits (\n\"PCUs\")\n.\n\u00b7\nThe\nthird and fourth PCUs being transferred from\nthe\nSahamamay\noperation to the Vatomina mine area\nwill be installed during April.\n\u00b7\nProduction guidance of 1000 MT per month by July 2025 and 1500 MT per month by December 2025 remains unchanged.\n\u00b7\nVAT refunds received in Madagascar of $195,000 during March 2025.\nSales Outlook\n\u00b7\nInterest from customers across all product grades has been strong in the intervening period since the last update.\n\u00b7\nAs at 31 March 2025, o\nnly 220 MTs\nof legacy prepaid orders (received and paid for in 2024 under the previous leadership) remain outstanding to be\nproduced\n, with pr\noduction and\nincurred costs\nfor these orders\nexpe\ncted\nto be\ncompleted\nby mid-April. From that point on, all sales will benefit current cashflows\n.\nFinancial Accounts and Audit\n\u00b7\nThe audit of the overdue financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 has now resumed, following the need to re-build the accounting system after the denial of access to IT systems by the previous CEO, as previously reported.\nMark Rollins, Executive Chairman of Tirupati Graphite commented:\n\"The Board is very pleased to have received significant demand for its 2025 Notes from existing and new investors. By surpassing the initial target of \u00a32.5m, the Company is well placed to pursue and deliver on the Board's stated objectives in our announcements and presentations to date, and I encourage those investors who would like to do so to contact the Company directly or through their advisors should they wish to participate.\"\nForward looking statements and disclaimers\nThe information contained in this document and others attached to or referred to here (together \"this document\") have been prepared by Tirupati Graphite plc (the \"Company\") solely for informational purposes.

(10%) of the rights to vote at a General Meeting of the Company attaching to ordinary shares.\n\u00b7\nIG has confirmed that it will not exercise its right to appoint a Board member while Mr Arun Somani serves as Interim CEO.\n\u00b7\nThe Company and IG have also entered into a Relationship Agreement: conditional on it holding a qualifying interest in ordinary shares carrying 20 per cent (20%) or more of the Company's voting share capital, IG undertakes that:\no\nthe Group and the business shall be managed for the benefit of the shareholders as a whole and independently of itself or any of its associates;\no\nall transactions, agreements and arrangements between the Company and IG and/or any of its associates shall be on an arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms; and\no\nthe composition of the Board shall at all times include at least two Independent Directors.\nFollowing the planned conversion to ordinary shares of the 2025 CLN, the Series 2 2025 CLN, and the 2019 CLN, together with adjustment for accrued interest thereon, expected later this year, IG would hold c.12.53% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of the Company (with the precise number at the time depending on the date of conversion and the interest calculation thereto).\nVatomina Operations\nProduction in August 2025 was below plan at 470 MTs. Nine days of mining were lost due to adverse weather and processing was hindered by ore quality issues, and plant operational issues.\nA temporary suspension of mining operations was implemented in mid-September 2025 in order to allow time to address these issues, the installation of additional equipment at the plant, and also allow for the refurbishment and replacement of a number of key plant operational items, which are now due to arrive in mid-October. The combination of these upgrades to the plant and targeted improvements in the mining performance are expected to drive a significant improvement in sustainable production from November onwards.\nMark Rollins, Executive Chairman of Tirupati Graphite Plc commented:\n\"I'd like to welcome Arun as CEO to support the ongoing Vatomina-focused turnaround and the operational improvement and implementation plan there. We are grateful for the continued support of Inland Global Ltd and other subscribers with the latest fundraising, and look forward to working closely together going forward. I'd like to thank James for his contributions as CEO to the turnaround at Vatomina in challenging inherited conditions from the start of the year, and am pleased he has agreed to continue to provide his experience and support as an NED. We will update stakeholders later this month regarding the resumption of operations at Vatomina, funding, the re-listing of the Shares and conversion of the loan notes due this year. We expect to file the audited accounts and annual report for the year ended 31 March 2025 around the end of this month.\"\nArun Somani, Chief Executive Officer of Tirupati Graphite Plc, commented:\n\"I am honoured to take on the role of CEO at this pivotal stage for Tirupati Graphite. My immediate priority is to stabilise operations and resume production at Vatomina without delay, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and disciplined cost control. Achieving reliable output in the short term will be the cornerstone of rebuilding confidence with our investors, partners, and employees.\nLooking beyond Vatomina, our long-term strategy is to unlock the potential of our other mining assets, at the Sahamamy site, and in Mozambique. These projects, combined with our operational improvements at Vatomina, will position Tirupati to become a significant supplier of natural graphite to the global market. I see significant opportunity to unlock further value across both upstream and downstream areas of the business.\nBy balancing immediate operational focus with long-term growth ambitions, we will strengthen the Company's foundation and deliver sustainable value creation for our shareholders while supporting the global energy transition.\"\nENDS\nFor further information, please visit\u202fhttps://www.tirupatigraphite.co.uk/\u202for contact:\nTirupati Graphite Plc\nMark Rollins - Executive Chairman\nAlastair Bath - Investor Relations\ninfo@tirupati.co.uk\nir@tirupati.co.uk\n+44 7356 057 265\nAbout Tirupati Graphite\u00a0Plc\nTirupati Graphite is a specialist graphite producer and a supplier of the critical mineral for a decarbonised economy and the energy transition, with leading low development capital and operating costs.
