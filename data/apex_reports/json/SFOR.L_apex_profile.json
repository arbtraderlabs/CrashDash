This will be achieved by integrating leading businesses in two synchronised practices: Marketing services and Technology services, along with an emphasis on 'faster, better, cheaper, more' execution in an always-on consumer-led environment, with a unitary structure.\nThe Company now has approximately 7,500 people in 33 countries with approximately 80% of net revenue across the Americas, 15% across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 5% across Asia-Pacific. The longer-term objective is a geographic split of 60%:20%:20%. At the Group's last full year results, Content accounted for approximately 60% of net revenue, Data&Digital Media 25% and Technology Services 15%. The long-term objective for the practices is a split of 50%:25%:25%.\nSir Martin was CEO of WPP for 33 years, building it from a \u00a31 million 'shell' company in 1985 into the world's largest advertising and marketing services company, with a market capitalisation of over \u00a316 billion on the day he left. Prior to that Sir Martin was Group Financial Director of Saatchi & Saatchi Company Plc for nine years.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As a result, clients remain generally cautious,\nwith technology clients, which account for almost half our revenue, in particular, continuing to prioritise capital expenditure on AI over operating expenditure, such as marketing. As anticipated, our Technology Services Practice continued to be affected by a reduction in one of our larger relationships. Our liquidity and cashflow was much improved compared with the first quarter of 2024 and net debt was at a similar level to the year-end. This was despite the first quarter, as usual, being the lowest quarter of activity and reflecting our focus on working capital and cost control.\nThe global macroeconomic environment has become even more challenging in 2025. Assessing the impact of US imposed tariffs has been added to the three principal risks around US/China relations, Russia/Ukraine and Iran/Middle-East. Clients, therefore, are likely to remain cautious. However, once the levels of tariffs are negotiated and impacts assessed, we believe clients will become more selective about the geographies in which they operate in order to find growth and focused on implementing technologies, such as, but not only AI, to drive efficiency in a slower growth, higher inflation and higher interest rate environment. This may be the time when AI-adoption accelerates at scale. With that said, we expect an improved performance in the second half of the year, aided by the phasing of revenue from new business. We will continue to focus on our cost base and will take further action to support profitability and expect net revenue and operational EBITDA to be broadly similar to 2024, on a constant currency basis, with a further reduction in net debt by year end to the range of \u00a3100-140 million.\nWe continue to focus on our larger, scaled relationships with leading enterprise clients and our drive for margin improvement\nthrough greater efficiency, utilisation, billability and pricing. We remain confident in our strategy, business model and talent,\nwhich together with scaled client relationships position us well for growth in the longer term. We continue to capitalise on our\nprominent AI positioning and are seeing multiple initial AI-related assignments and new business opportunities.\"\nNotes (in this document):\n1.\nOperational EBITDA is operating profit or loss adjusted for acquisition related expenses, non-recurring items (primarily acquisition payments tied to continued employment, amortisation and impairment of business combination intangible assets and restructuring and other one-off expenses) and recurring items (share-based payments) and includes right-of-use assets depreciation. It is a non-GAAP measure management uses to assess the underlying business performance. Operational EBITDA margin is operational EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue.\n2.\nNet revenue is revenue less direct costs.\n3.\nLike-for-like is a non-GAAP measure and relates to 2024 being restated to show the unaudited numbers for the previous year of the existing and acquired businesses consolidated for the same months as in 2025, applying currency rates as used in 2025.\n4.\nPro-forma numbers relate to unaudited full year non-statutory and non-GAAP consolidated results in constant currency as if the Group had existed in full for the year and have been prepared under comparable GAAP with no consolidation eliminations in the pre-acquisition period.\n5.\nBillings is gross billings to clients including pass through costs.\n6.\nNet debt excludes lease liabilities.\n7.\nThis is a target and not a profit forecast.\nQ1 Trading Update\nThe macroeconomic environment in the first quarter remained challenging with significant volatility and uncertainty in global economic policy. Clients have remained cautious and we also saw a reduction in activity in one key Technology Services client, as expected. Billings were \u00a3463.3 million up 8.6% like-for-like and 7.7% reported, reflecting stronger digital media planning and buying activity. Like-for-like revenue was down 14.3%, down 15.3% reported to \u00a3178.1 million. Like-for-like net revenue declined 11.4%, or 12.2% on a reported basis to \u00a3163.7 million.\nQ1 operational EBITDA was in line with our expectations, re\ufb02ecting the benefit of cost actions taken in reaction to lower activity levels. The number of Monks in the Company was around 7,000 at the end of the first quarter, down 8% compared to circa 7,600 at the end of the Q1 2024 and 2% lower than our year end figure of about 7,150, reflecting the continued focus on pricing and billability. We maintain a disciplined approach to managing our cost base and continue our drive for margin improvement through greater efficiency, utilisation, billability and pricing.\nPerformance by Practice\nMarketing Services like-for-like net revenue for the first quarter was down 7.5% and 8.6% reported to \u00a3148.3 million, reflecting ongoing caution and lower activity with some of our larger technology clients, who continued to prioritise spend on building AI capacity. Marketing Services continues to focus on efficiency, utilisation, billability and pricing.\nTechnology Services' first quarter like-for-like net revenue was down 36.9% and 36.4% reported to \u00a315.4 million primarily reflecting lower activity with one key client and as well as longer sales cycles for new business.\nPerformance by Geography\nThe Americas like-for-like net revenue, which accounts for 80% of the Company's total, was down 10.5%, but with strong growth in Latin America. EMEA, accounting for 15%, was down 15.9%, with lower activity in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Asia Pacific, accounting for the remaining 5%, was down 11.0%, affected by Australia and Singapore.\nNew business and AI\nWe are seeing our AI initiatives improve visualisation and copywriting productivity, deliver considerably more effective and economic hyper-personalisation (better targeted content at greater scale), delivering more automated and integrated media planning and buying, improving general client and agency efficiency and democratising knowledge. Monks.Flow is our AI product solution that automates marketing workflows and we are continuing to add applications and expand its capabilities. Our end-to-end suite of Monks.Flow products orchestrates and helps enable our clients to more easily implement AI solutions, particularly in visualisation and copywriting, in hyper-personalisation at scale, in real time focus groups and linking media planning and buying. We are now producing high quality commercials using AI technologies such Runway, Flux, Omniverse (Nvidia), Substance (Adobe) and Unreal that literally take hours and days to produce at significantly lower cost rather than traditional production techniques, which take weeks and months at significantly greater cost. The quality continues to improve in real time and clients that are exposed to the results of these AI technologies are very excited about their implementation and the commercial impact on their marketing budgets and return on investment.\nWe are seeing significant opportunities for new business, particularly driven by our AI tools and capability. New business wins in the first quarter include new or broadened relationships with Asana, Amplifon, Samsung, Square, NCS and Opella. We also continue to expand many of our existing relationships, in particular GM and Amazon, which will ramp up significantly in the second half of the year. In April we won a large \"Real Time Brands\" assignment with an existing TMT \"whopper\", which will also contribute to our second half performance and over time more than double in size. We continue to win multiple exploratory assignments, as clients experiment and explore AI applications and develop AI use cases. AI capability is becoming more central to the agency's way of working and new business efforts. In this regard the Company's early adoption of AI and proactive approach to staff training on AI is beginning to pay off.\nOur new Go-To-Market propositions, Orchestration Partner, Real Time Brands, Glass Box Media and Digital Transformation are all starting to resonate strongly with clients. These are built around hyper-personalisation at scale, social media, brand strategy, transparent media buying and planning and the leveraging of technology.\nDividend\nOn the 23 March 2025 the Board proposed a final dividend of 1p per share, amounting to \u00a36.1 million, subject to shareowner approval. This will be paid on 10 July 2025 to all shareowners on the register as at 6 June 2025.\nBalance Sheet\nNet debt6 ended the first quarter at \u00a3144.8 million, or 1.7x net debt/12 month pro-forma operational EBITDA. This compares to \u00a3206.0 million at the end of the first quarter last year. The trailing 12 months pro-forma EBITDA was \u00a385.5 million. We expect net debt to reduce as we progress through the second half of 2025 and maintain our target of \u00a3100 to \u00a3140 million for year end. The balance sheet has sufficient liquidity and long-dated debt maturities to facilitate growth and our key covenant, being net debt not to exceed 4.5x the 12 month pro-forma EBITDA. Our RCF of \u00a3100 million remains undrawn.\nBoard\nThe Company was pleased to announce the appointment of Radhika Radhakrishnan as Chief Financial Officer on 1 May 2025, succeeding Mary Basterfield. Radhika was Global Chief Finance Officer of Wavemaker, one of WPPs media brands at Group M, and at Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), one of Publicis' creative agencies. Prior to her time at BBH, she was Chief Finance Officer at 20th Century Fox UK and Chief Financial Officer of Hachette Filipacchi UK, now Hearst Magazines. Radhika qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Ernst & Young London and is a Non-Executive Director of the University of Cambridge Press and Assessment Board.\nThe Board unanimously thanks Mary for her hard work and commitment over the last three years and for improving cost management, liquidity and the financial processes of the company and wishes her every success in her future career.\nThe Company was also pleased to announce the appointment of Nirvik Singh as an independent Non-executive Director of S4 Capital plc on 1 May 2025. Nirvik previously served as Global Chief Operating Officer and President International of Grey Group, a WPP subsidiary, overseeing operations across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. He has also led multiple acquisitions in China, India, South Korea, the UAE, the UK and South Africa, covering sectors such as e-commerce, data analytics and marketing technology. Beginning his career at Lipton India, a Unilever company, Nirvik transitioned into advertising, becoming CEO of Grey Group India at 33 and later leading its expansion into South Asia. In 2010 he relocated to Singapore, when he was appointed Chairman and CEO of Grey Asia-Pacific, before assuming his global role in 2019. He is currently Chairman of Hype Luxury, a luxury mobility aggregator, Non-executive Director of Shoppers Stop, a $800m market capitalisation retail company, Non-executive Director and member of the Nomination and Remuneration, and Risk Committees of Gulf Oil India and an Advisor to Charge Europa, a Polish EV charging company.\nBoth Radhika and Nirvik will stand for election to the Board at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 4 June 2025.\nESG\nWe remain committed to the pillars of our ESG strategy: people fulfilment, our responsibility to the world and one brand. We continue to focus on improving our external reporting, our reporting tools and governance to help us move towards increased transparency and effective reporting and to comply with future global regulatory requirements.\nSummary and outlook\nWe maintain our targets for the year.\nFor the Company as a whole, despite the wider market uncertainty and significant volatility in global economic policy, particularly as a result of the US-imposed tariffs, we continue to target net revenue and operational EBITDA7 to be broadly similar to 2024 on a constant currency basis. We will continue to focus on our cost base and will take further action to support profitability, if necessary. As expected the comparatives for the first half continue to be difficult, in part due to the residual effect of the reduction in revenue from one key client in Technology Services. We expect an improved performance in the second half of the year and a greater second half weighting than in the prior year, enhanced by the phasing of new business revenue, including wins already secured.\nOur targeted range for the year end net debt remains \u00a3100 million to \u00a3140 million. We target medium term financial leverage at the lower end of our previous range of around 1.5 times operational EBITDA. Over the longer term we continue to expect our growth to outperform our markets and operational EBITDA margins to return to historic levels of around 20%7.\nThe strategy of S4Capital remains the same. The Company's unitary, purely digital transformation model, based on first-party data fuelling the creation, production and distribution of digital advertising content, distributed by digital media and built on technology platforms to ensure success and efficiency, resonates with clients.\nWe continue to streamline and integrate our businesses, we have rebranded to Monks and are focusing all our current capabilities into two Practices: Marketing Services and Technology Services. Our tagline 'faster, better, cheaper and more' or 'speed, quality, value and more' and a unitary structure both appeal strongly, even more so in challenging economic times.\nWebcast and conference call\nA webcast and conference call will be held at 09:00 BST in London, followed by another webcast and call at 08:00 EDT/13:00 BST.\n09:00 BST webcast (watch only) and conference call (for Q&A):\nWebcast: https://brrmedia.news/SFOR_Q125\nConference call:\nUK: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200\nUS: +1 786 697 3501\n08:00 EDT/13:00 BST webcast (watch only) and conference call (for Q&A):\nWebcast: https://brrmedia.news/SFOR_Q125_US\nConference call:\nUK: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200\nUS: +1 786 697 3501\nEnquiries to:\nS4Capital plc\n+44 (0)20 3793 0003\nSir Martin Sorrell (Executive Chairman)\nScott Spirit (Chief Growth Officer)\nSodali & Co (PR Advisor)\n+44 (0)7970 246 725\nElly Williamson/ Pete Lambie\nAbout S\n4\nCapital\nOur strategy is to build a purely digital advertising and marketing services business for global, multinational, regional, and local clients, and millennial-driven influencer brands.
