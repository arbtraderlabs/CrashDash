Background to and reasons for the Fundraise\nFollowing the fundamental transformation of the business over the last 24 months, the Company's strategy has been reset with the Group focused on a single SaaS product implemented through its partner-led-goto-market approach. The Company's brand has been modernised with customer service and operational efficiencies significantly improved.\nWith the foundations of the revised strategy laid out and following the Group's \u00a33.3 million fundraise in August 2023, the Group has worked hard to improve its operating model and has focused on sustainable growth through investment in both the Research & Development and Sales & Marketing teams. Notably, the Group has appointed a fractional Chief Technology Officer and commenced re-building of the Sales team including the appointment of a fractional Chief Revenue Officer. The Directors believe that fractional\nappointments combine a higher level of skillset with a more efficient use of resources.\nThese investments have enabled the Company to make significant progress, and the Group's strategy has been validated through:\n\u00b7\nThe transitioning of the business to spend intelligence following the successful operational launch of the Company's AI offering;\n\u00b7\nThe winning of a three-year contract with one of the world's 10 largest technology companies as announced on 21 August 2024; and\n\u00b7\nThe embedding of the partnership with ChainIQ.\nThe pipeline of opportunities in the near-term is also strong, and the Group is notably in advanced negotiations to form a major partnership with one of the world's top 5 largest consulting firms.\nThe Group is now seeking to continue to take advantage of a growing market to execute its business strategy through the Rosslyn Artificial Intelligence Classification Engine (\"AiCE\"), which utilises AI to automate procurement data categorisation and classification.\nThe foundation for all spend intelligence is the quality of the underlying procurement data. By harnessing the power of AI, Rosslyn can automatically generate the categorisations and classifications of extracted procurement data, which is a process that must be undertaken before the data can be analysed. The Directors believe that automating this process significantly increases accuracy, expands the volume and complexity of data that can be incorporated and therefore shortens the time to insight - which is particularly important for meeting the increasing demand for real-time procurement insight. It also reduces the need for time-consuming ongoing manual maintenance of classification rules and frameworks.\nAs previously announced, a successful proof-of-concept of AiCE was conducted with four key clients during FY 2024 and following further development and refinement, the new AiCE solution became operational with the first customer in April 2024, as planned, and is currently live with six clients. Rosslyn expects to make AiCE commercially available by the end of the first half of the current financial year, when it will be sold as an additional classification-as-a-service module.\nThe Company is also in the process of developing a procurement data lake which, through machine learning, can lead to predictive intelligence. Optimal performance requires continuous refining and enriching of the data within the procurement data lake, which is most effectively achieved through an automated engine, particularly for organisations with large and complex data sets. Accordingly, the Directors believe that AiCE represents a transformational opportunity for Rosslyn and looks forward to updating the market on its progress.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Fundraising to invest in growth to drive the execution of its business strategy, namely continuing the development of AiCE and providing working capital support to extend the cash runway for a minimum of 18 months.\nThe Board believe that the Group now has a clear pathway set out to achieve profitability and that it is well positioned to capitalise on the significant growth opportunities that the market is presenting. The Board believes that Rosslyn is at an inflection point and that the Fundraising will enable the Company to reach positive adjusted EBITDA and cash generation on a monthly basis from later this financial year and for the full year from FY 2026 onwards, allow for revenue growth at c.40 per cent. year-on-year, and improve all KPIs in order to increase its market valuation.\nCurrent trading and prospects\nThe Board of Rosslyn confirmed in its trading update dated 21 August 2024 (the \"Trading Update\") that it expects to report revenue for FY 2024 in line with management's previously stated expectations of \u00a32.9m (FY 2023: \u00a33.0m) and annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") of \u00a32.3m (FY 2023: \u00a32.4m), with the reduction reflecting the protracted timelines associated with contract negotiations for sizable new opportunities.\nThe Company expects to report gross margin for FY 2024 of approximately 39 per cent. (2023: 34.7 per cent.), with the improvement being driven by the aforementioned actions. The Board expects this momentum to continue as the new higher-margin contracts are signed and the benefits of the platform enhancements are fully recognised.\nThe Company expects to report an adjusted1 EBITDA loss for FY 2024 of \u00a32.5m (FY 2023: \u00a32.0m loss) and\nEBITDA loss of \u00a33.3m (FY 2023: \u00a32.4m loss), which is ahead of management's previously stated expectations and reflects the Board's strategic decision to prioritise sustainable growth and focus on the quality of revenues. The increase in EBITDA loss (on a reported and adjusted basis) for FY 2024 compared\nwith the prior year is due to the lower revenue and greater costs as the Company increased its level of activity as it began to rebuild its business following a period of significant restructuring. In addition, the Company generated profit in FY 2023 from the sale of discontinued operations.\nAs at 30 April 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of c. \u00a3807k (30 April 2023: \u00a3767k). Cash\nburn was c. \u00a3218k per month (FY 2023: \u00a3205k), reflecting the rebuilding of the business.\nThe Company announced on 21 August 2024 that it had been awarded a three-year contract (the \"Contract\"), worth a minimum revenue value of \u00a32m, by one of the world's largest technology companies (the \"Customer\") after a nine month tender process. The Contract also brings further possible growth opportunities through expansion into the Customer's other divisions and operations, and the Customer and Rosslyn are also engagement in a co-innovation partnership for enhanced technology development.\nThe Company also announced in the Trading Update that it had signed a two-year contract renewal with one of its largest customers, with the contract value increasing by over 20 per cent. This increase partly reflects Rosslyn introducing its strengthened customer success function as an additional chargeable service. This function generates additional value for customers by enabling them to maximise their use of the Rosslyn platform and more effectively identify risk in their supply chains.\nThe Company's near-term pipeline remains strong with the Company in the advanced stages of concluding a number of new contracts. This includes being in advanced negotiations to form a major partnership with one of the world's largest consulting firms (the \"Consulting Partner\"), which would result in the Consulting Partner replacing its own internal spend intelligence tool with the Rosslyn platform. The partnership would provide a significant new channel to market and an initial three-month internal spend visibility project has been proposed for the Consulting Firm's US operations which will establish its internal skillsets to use the Rosslyn platform. Rosslyn's spend cubes are to be used in the initial proposals and then the Directors believe that the Company will then be recommended as a preferred supplier to customers as part of wider engagement. More than ten prospective new business opportunities have already been introduced to the Company, with one in advanced negotiation, and discussions are already underway to establish partnerships with other geographies. The Directors believe that this is a further validation of the Company's partner-led go-to-market approach.\nAs significant new contracts are signed and the Group begins to benefit from the increased platform efficiency, the Company expects that it will be cash-generative in FY26. The Board is focused on achieving positive adjusted EBITDA and cash generation on a monthly basis by the end of the current financial year and on an annual basis from FY 2026 and has mapped out actions that they consider will form the pathway to this profitability. These actions include:\n\u00b7\nThe Group's new technology architecture being expected to reduce breakeven to \u00a33.5m ARR;\n\u00b7\nNew business wins;\n\u00b7\nNew contracts/amendments with existing customers improving profitability and decreasing risk;\n\u00b7\nA fully utilised professional services team;\n\u00b7\nContinued tight cost control; and\n\u00b7\nFurther actions to drive margin improvement.\nThe Market\nThe Board believes that the Group is now well positioned in a market which continues to expand at high pace and remains poised for disruption. The Board further believes that, given the lack of visibility within complex and poor quality data sets and the increased demand to manage ever increasing supply chain data, there is a market requirement for a spend intelligence solution. Rosslyn's platform is capable of addressing these issues by incorporating a real-time procurement data lake that fuses internal and external data providing customers with enhance insight and intelligence into their data.\nImportance of Shareholder Approval of the Fundraising\nAs noted above the Company's cash burn is c. \u00a3218k per month. With cash and cash equivalents at 30 April 2024 of \u00a3807k, without the additional funding proposed to be raised in connection with the Fundraising, the Board anticipates that the Group will face more acute liquidity pressures.\nIn the absence of alternative funding proposals, the Board firmly believes that the Fundraising is in the best interests of the Company. If the Fundraising is not approved by Shareholders, and absent material financial support from the Company's creditors or shareholders, which the Board considers unlikely, the Group will not have the sufficient funds required to meet its immediate working capital requirements.\nThe Board therefore strongly recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions required to\napprove the Fundraising.\n2. The Capital Reorganisation\nThe Company is not permitted by law to issue Ordinary Shares at an issue price which is below their nominal value, currently 25 pence per Existing Ordinary Share. In order to enable the Company to issue shares at n issue price which exceeds their nominal value, the Company is proposing to complete a Capital Reorganisation of the Ordinary Share capital of the Company. Each of the Existing Ordinary Shares will be subdivided into one New Ordinary Share of 0.1 pence each and one Deferred Share of 24.9 pence each.\nThe Capital Reorganisation will not of itself affect the value of the shares held by Shareholders. After the Capital Reorganisation there will be the same number of New Ordinary Shares in issue as there are Existing Ordinary Shares in issue (prior to completion of the Fundraising) and therefore current shareholdings will not be diluted by the Capital Reorganisation alone, unless the Fundraising (or any other further equity fundraising) is completed by the Company.\nThe New Ordinary Shares will have the same rights as those currently accruing to the Existing Ordinary Shares in issue, including those relating to voting and entitlement to dividends.\nThe Deferred Shares will have no significant rights attached to them and carry no right to vote or participate in distribution of surplus assets and will not be admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. Therefore, the Deferred Shares will effectively carry no value.\nHolders of options over Existing Ordinary Shares will maintain the same rights as currently accruing to them and will not be issued with new option certificates.\nResolution 4 in the Notice of General Meeting contained in this Circular is proposed to amend the existing articles of association of the Company to,\ninter alia\n, create the new Deferred Shares and to set out rights pertaining thereto relative to the New Ordinary Shares. Resolution 4 is conditional upon the passing of Resolution 1. A copy of the amended articles of association will be available for inspection throughout the General Meeting.\n3. The Conversion\nOn 30 August 2023, the Company announced, inter alia, that it had raised a total of \u00a3600,000 through the issue of the 2023 Convertible Loan Notes to Hargreave Hale AIM VCT plc (\u00a3300,000), Octopus AIM VCT plc (\u00a3180,000) and Octopus AIM VCT 2 plc (\u00a3120,000). The 2023 Convertible Loan Notes carry interest at 10 per cent. which has and continues to be rolled up.\nThe Company has been notified by each of the 2023 CLN Holders, being Hargreave Hale AIM VCT plc, Octopus AIM VCT plc, and Octopus AIM VCT 2 plc, of their intention to convert both the principal and the interest accrued of the 2023 Convertible Loan Notes into new Ordinary Shares in the Company at the Issue Price. The total number of Conversion Shares is 13,328,150, comprising:\n\u00b7\nHargreave Hale AIM VCT plc: 6,664,075 Conversion Shares\n\u00b7\nOctopus AIM VCT plc: 3,998,445 Conversion Shares\n\u00b7\nOctopus AIM VCT 2 plc: 2,665,630 Conversion Shares\nThe Conversion is conditional on the Resolutions being passed which will provide shareholder authority for the allotment and issue by the Company of the Conversion Shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis and completion of the Placing.\n4. Details of the Fundraising\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Company is conditionally raising gross proceeds of a minimum \u00a31.04 million through the Placing at the Issue Price. The Placing comprises a placing of a minimum of 4,070,000 EIS/VCT Placing Shares and a placing of a minimum of 16,650,000 General Placing Shares with new and existing institutional investors and other investors. The Issue Price represents a 55.2 per cent. discount to the closing mid-market price of 11.15 pence on 7 October 2024, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Announcement.\nPursuant to the Placing Agreement, Cavendish has conditionally agreed to use its reasonable endeavours to procure subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price.\nThe Placing has not been underwritten by Cavendish or any other party and the Placing is conditional,\ninter alia\n, on:\n\u00b7\nthe Placing Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to Admission;\n\u00b7\nthe Resolutions being passed which will provide shareholder authority for the allotment and issue by the Company of the Fundraising Shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis;\n\u00b7\nthe issue of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes; and\n\u00b7\nthe admission of the Placing Shares becoming effective by no later than 8.00 a.m. on 28 October 2024 or such later time and/or date as the Company and Cavendish may agree (being no later than 8.00 a.m. on 18 November 2024).\nThe Placing is not conditional upon the completion of the Retail Offer, but is conditional upon the Capital Reorganisation, the Conversion and the issue of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes. Completion of the Retail Offer, the Capital Reorganisation, the Conversion and the issue of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes are conditional,\ninter alia\n, upon completion of the Placing.\nThe Placing Agreement contains customary warranties from the Company in favour of Cavendish in relation to,\ninter alia\n, the accuracy of the information in this Announcement and other matters relating to the Company and its business. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify Cavendish in relation to certain liabilities that they may incur in respect of the Fundraising.\nThe Fundraising comprises the Placing, the Director's Intended Subscription, the issue of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes and the Retail Offer. The Fundraising and the Conversion are each conditional, among other matters, on the passing of a resolution to be proposed at the General Meeting, granting authority to the Directors to allot the Fundraising Shares, Conversion Shares and the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes on a non-pre-emptive basis, and on Admission.\nCavendish (acting in good faith) has the right to terminate the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances prior to Admission in respect of the Placing Shares and Retail Offer Shares, including (but not limited to): in the event that there has, in the opinion of Cavendish (acting in good faith) been a breach, or an alleged breach, of any of the warranties in the Placing Agreement or there has occurred in the opinion of Cavendish (acting in good faith) a material adverse change. Cavendish may also terminate the Placing Agreement if there has been a significant change in certain international financial markets, a suspension or material limitation in trading on certain stock exchanges or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance which Cavendish considers (acting in good faith) makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the Placing or Admission.\nDetails of the Director's Intended Subscription\nJames Appleby, Non-Executive Chairman, intends to subscribe for the Subscription Shares at the Issue Price for a subscription of up to \u00a3264,000. As the Company is currently in a closed period under MAR until the publication of its final results for the period ended 30 April 2024 (\"FY24 Results\"), James Appleby is not permitted to deal in the Company's Ordinary Shares (including subscribing) until after publication of the FY24 Results (and subject to each not being in possession of any other unpublished price sensitive information at such time).\nAssuming the Director's Intended Subscriptions proceeds, the Company will apply for admission of the Subscription Shares to trading on AIM separately and to take effect following the admission of the Placing Shares, the Retail Offer Shares and the Conversion Shares.\nDetails of the Retail Offer\nThe Company values its retail Shareholder base and believes that it is appropriate to provide the retail community resident in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in the Retail Offer at the Issue Price.\nOn the terms set out in a separate announcement made following the issue of the Announcement, the Company is using the PrimaryBid platform to conduct an offer for subscription of up to 5,000,000 Retail Offer Shares. Members of the public in the UK can access the Retail Offer through PrimaryBid's extensive partner network of investment platforms, retail brokers and wealth managers, subject to such partners' participation.\nFor further information on the Retail Offer, please refer to the relevant announcement on 8 October 2024.\nDetails of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes\nHargreave Hale AIM VCT plc and Amati AIM VCT plc have signed a non-binding term sheet for \u00a3400,000 and for \u00a3800,000 respectively of 10 per cent. convertible loan notes. The terms of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes are that they are repayable after 5 years and carry an interest rate of 10 per cent. per annum which will be rolled up. The Fundraise is conditional on binding agreements being entered into for the issue of these convertible loan notes.\nThe principal and rolled up interest are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company at the repayment date at the noteholders option. The 2024 Convertible Loan Notes convert into ordinary shares of the Company at a price of the lower of (1) 6p, (2) the subscription price of the last funding round prior to a conversion event, (3) in respect of an early redemption only, the closing bid price per Ordinary Share on the business day immediately preceding the date of the conversion, or (4) a 25 per cent. discount on the offer price per ordinary share on a change of control. Such conversion price can never be lower than the nominal value of the ordinary shares.\n5. EIS/VCT Schemes\nAlthough the Directors believe that the EIS/VCT Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will be 'eligible shares' and will be capable of being a qualifying holding for the purposes of investment by VCTs and will also satisfy the conditions of section 173 of ITA for the purposes of the EIS and the Directors are not aware of any subsequent change in the qualifying conditions or the Company's circumstances that would prevent the EIS/VCT Placing Shares from being eligible for EIS and VCT investments on this occasion, neither the Directors nor the Company nor Cavendish, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates or advisers give any warranty or undertaking or other assurance that relief will be available in respect of any investment in the EIS/ VCT Placing Shares, nor do they warrant or undertake or otherwise give any assurance that the Company will conduct its activities in a way that qualifies for or preserves its status.\n6. Admission, Settlement, Dealings and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the New Ordinary Shares of 0.1 pence each (assuming the Capital Reorganisation is approved at the General Meeting) to trading on AIM. Admission is expected to occur at 8.00 a.m. on 28 October 2024 (or such later times(s) and/or date(s) as Cavendish and the Company may agree).\nFollowing Admission, the total number of New Ordinary Shares in issue (assuming full take up of the Retail Offer) is expected to be 56,707,425 with each New Ordinary Share carrying the right to one vote. There are, and following Admission will be, no New Ordinary Shares held in treasury and therefore the total number of voting rights in the Company is expected to be 56,707,425. Assuming full take up of the Retail Offer, the above figure may be used by Shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure, Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n7. General Meeting\nSet out at the end of the Circular is a notice convening a general meeting of the Company to be held at Gracechurch Group, 4th Floor, 48 Gracechurch St, London, EC3V 0EJ at 11.00 a.m. on 25 October 2024. The Notice of General Meeting sets out the proposed Resolutions upon which Shareholders will be asked to vote. The Resolutions are ordinary resolutions to issue and allot the Fundraising Shares and the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes pursuant to the Fundraising and the Conversion Shares, and to subdivide each of the Existing Ordinary Shars of 25 pence each into one Existing Ordinary Share of 0.1 pence each and one Deferred Share of 24.9 pence each, and special resolutions to disapply pre-emption rights for the issue of the Fundraising Shares, the issue of the 2024 Convertible Loan Notes pursuant to the Fundraising and the Conversion Shares, and amend the Articles to create the share rights for the Deferred Shares. The ordinary resolutions will require a majority of those Shareholders present in person or by proxy and the special resolution will require a majority of 75 per cent. of those Shareholders voting to vote in favour in order to be passed.\nAction to be taken in respect of the General Meeting\nA copy of the Circular will be published on the Company's website and posted to those Shareholders that have elected to receive communications in hard copy. Those Shareholders will find accompanying the Circular a Form of Proxy for use in connection with the General Meeting. The Form of Proxy should be completed and returned in accordance with the instructions thereon so as to be received by Link Group at PXS 1, Central Square, 29 Wellington Street, Leeds LS1 4DL as soon as possible and in any event not later than 48 hours before the time of the General Meeting. Completion and return of the Form of Proxy will not prevent a Shareholder from attending and voting at the General Meeting should he/she/it so wish. Alternatively, Shareholders may appoint a proxy via Signal Shares or via CREST and should see the notes to the Notice of General Meeting at the end of the Circular for further guidance.\n8. Recommendation\nThe Directors believe the Transaction to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions required to implement them, as they intend to do in respect of their beneficial shareholdings amounting to 2.24 per cent. of the Existing Ordinary Shares.\nAPPENDIX\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PLACING\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR INVITED PLACEES ONLY REGARDING THE PLACING\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INCLUDING THIS APPENDIX AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN (TOGETHER THE \"ANNOUNCEMENT\") IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, HONG KONG OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL.

Cavendish is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA and is acting exclusively for the Company and no one else in connection with the matters referred to in this Announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to each of Cavendish' customers or for providing advice in relation to the matters described in this Announcement.\n2 Participation in the Placing will only be available to persons who may lawfully be and are invited by Cavendish to participate. Cavendish and any of its affiliates are entitled to participate in the Placing as principal.\n3 The price per Placing Share is 5 pence and is payable to Cavendish as agent of the Company by all Placees.\n4 Subject to the Company's final approval, each Placee's allocation is determined by Cavendish following consultation with the Company and has been or will be confirmed orally by Cavendish, as applicable, and a form of confirmation will be dispatched as soon as possible thereafter. That oral confirmation will give rise to an irrevocable, legally binding commitment by that person (who at that point becomes a Placee), in favour of Cavendish and the Company, under which it agrees to acquire the number of Placing Shares allocated to the Placee at the Issue Price and otherwise on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Appendix and in accordance with the Articles. Except with the prior written consent of Cavendish, such commitment will not be capable of variation or revocation at the time at which it is submitted.\n5 Each Placee's allocation and commitment will be evidenced by a form of confirmation issued to such Placee by Cavendish. The terms of this Appendix will be deemed incorporated in that form of confirmation.\n6 Each Placee will have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to Cavendish as agent for the Company, to pay to it (or as they may direct) in cleared funds an amount equal to the product of the Issue Price and the number of Placing Shares such Placee has agreed to acquire and the Company has agreed to allot and issue to that Placee.\n7 Irrespective of the time at which a Placee's allocation(s) pursuant to the Placing is/are confirmed, settlement for all Placing Shares to be acquired pursuant to the Placing will be required to be made at the same time, on the basis explained below under \"Registration and Settlement\".\n8 All obligations of Cavendish under the Placing will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under \"Conditions of the Placing\" and to the Placing not being terminated on the basis referred to below under \"Termination of the Placing\".\n9 By participating in the Placing, each Placee will agree that its rights and obligations in respect of the Placing will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee.\n10 To the fullest extent permissible by law and applicable FCA rules, none of (a) Cavendish, (b) any of its affiliates, agents, directors, officers, consultants, (c) to the extent not contained within (a) or (b), any person connected with Cavendish as defined in the FSMA ((b) and (c) being together \"affiliates\" and individually an \"affiliate\" of Cavendish), (d) any person acting on behalf of Cavendish, shall have any liability (including to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) to Placees or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise. In particular, Cavendish nor any of its affiliates shall have any liability (including, to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of their conduct in relation to the Placing or of such alternative method of effecting the Placing as Cavendish and the Company may agree.\nRegistration and Settlement\nIf Placees are allocated any Placing Shares in the Placing they will be sent a form of confirmation or electronic confirmation by Cavendish, as soon as it is able which will confirm the number of Placing Shares allocated to them, the Issue Price and the aggregate amount owed by them to Cavendish.\nEach Placee will be deemed to agree that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed as directed by Cavendish in accordance with either the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions which they have in place with Cavendish.\nSettlement of transactions in the Placing Shares (ISIN: GB00BMV2DB09) following Admission will take place within the CREST system, subject to certain exceptions.

The deadline for Placees to input instructions into CREST is 12.00 pm on 25 October 2024. Admission and settlement may occur at an earlier date, which if achievable, will be set out in the Circular. Settlement will be on a delivery versus payment basis.\u00a0However, in the event of any difficulties or delays in the admission of the Placing Shares to CREST or the use of CREST in relation to the Placing, the Company and Cavendish may agree that the Placing Shares should be issued in certificated form. Cavendish reserves the right to require settlement of the Placing Shares, and to deliver the Placing Shares to Placees, by such other means as it deems necessary if delivery or settlement to Placees is not practicable within the CREST system or would not be consistent with regulatory requirements in a Placee's jurisdiction.\nInterest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above, in respect of either CREST or certificated deliveries, at the rate of 2 percentage points above prevailing Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) as determined by Cavendish.\nEach Placee agrees that if it does not comply with these obligations, Cavendish may sell, charge by way of security (to any funder of Cavendish) or otherwise deal with any or all of their Placing Shares on their behalf and retain from the proceeds, for Cavendish' own account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due and any costs and expenses properly incurred by Cavendish as a result of the Placee's failure to comply with its obligations. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the amount owed by it and for any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of their Placing Shares on their behalf.\u00a0Legal and/or beneficial title in and to any Placing Shares shall not pass to the relevant Placee until such time as it has fully complied with its obligations hereunder.\nIf Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees must ensure that, upon receipt, the conditional form of confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation. Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee's name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. Placees will not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Placing.\nConditions of the Placing\nThe Placing is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms.\nCavendish' obligations under the Placing Agreement are, and the Placing is, conditional upon,\ninter alia\n:\n1 Admission taking place not later than 8.00 a.m. on 28 October 2024 or such later date as is agreed in writing between the Company and Cavendish, but in any event not later than the Long Stop Date;\n2 each of the Hargreave Subscription Letter, the Amati Subscription Letter and the 2024 Convertible Loan Note Instrument having been duly entered into by the parties thereto;\n3 the Company complying with its obligations under the Placing Agreement to the extent that the same fall to be performed prior to Admission;\n4 there not occurring, in Cavendish' opinion (acting in good faith), a Material Adverse Change;\n5 the General Meeting having taken place, no adjournment of the General Meeting having occurred without the prior written consent of Cavendish and the Resolutions having been passed at the General Meeting by the requisite majority without amendment;\n6 satisfaction or, where appropriate, the waiver of certain other conditions set out in the Placing Agreement,\n(all conditions to the obligations of Cavendish included in the Placing Agreement being together, the \"conditions\").\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Placing is not conditional on the Retail Offer (or any take up of the Retail Offer Shares) or the Subscription.\nIf any of the conditions set out in the Placing Agreement are not fulfilled or, where permitted, waived in accordance with the Placing Agreement within the stated time periods (or such later time and/or date as the Company and Cavendish may agree), or the Placing Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Placing will lapse and the Placee's rights and obligations shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by or on behalf of the Placee (or any person on whose behalf the Placee is acting) in respect thereof.\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations cease and terminate only in the circumstances described above and under \"Termination of the Placing\" below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it.\nCertain conditions may be waived in whole or in part by Cavendish, in its absolute discretion, by notice in writing to the Company and Cavendish may also agree in writing with the Company to extend the time for satisfaction of any condition. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees' commitments as set out in this Announcement.\nCavendish may terminate the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances, details of which are set out below.\nNeither Cavendish, the Company nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision any of them may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision any of them may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Placing generally and by participating in the Placing each Placee agrees that any such decision is within Cavendish' absolute discretion.\nTermination of the Placing\nCavendish may terminate the Placing Agreement, in accordance with its terms, at any time prior to Admission if,\ninter alia\n:\n1 any of the warranties in the Placing Agreement were, when given, untrue, inaccurate, or misleading; or\n2 the Company fails or is unable to comply with its\u00a0obligations under the Placing Agreement; or\n3 any statement contained in the Placing Documents (as defined in the Placing Agreement) has become or been discovered to be untrue, inaccurate or misleading or there has been a material omission therefrom; or\n4 a matter, fact, circumstance or event has arisen such that in the opinion of Cavendish (acting in good faith) a supplementary circular and/or supplementary press announcement is required to be published or released; or\n5 a Material Adverse Change has occurred.\nIf the Placing Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the rights and obligations of each Placee in respect of the Placing as described in this Announcement shall cease and terminate at such time and no claim can be made by any Placee in respect thereof.\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees with the Company and Cavendish that the exercise by the Company or Cavendish of any right of termination or any other right or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Company and / or Cavendish and that neither the Company nor Cavendish need make any reference to such Placee and that none of the Company, Cavendish nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to such Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) whatsoever in connection with any such exercise.\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations terminate only in the circumstances described above and under the \"Conditions of the Placing\" section above and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it after the issue by Cavendish of a form of confirmation confirming each Placee's allocation and commitment in the Placing.\nRestrictions on issues of shares and other securities by the Company\nThe Company has undertaken to Cavendish that, during the period ending on the later of (i) 180 days after the date of Admission, and (ii) publication of the audited results of the Company for financial period ending 30 April 2024, it will not without the prior consent of Cavendish allot or issue, or enter into any agreement or arrangement which would give rise to an obligation or an increased obligation (in each case whether contingent or otherwise) to allot or issue, any share or any instrument or security convertible into a share in the capital of the Company (save for the allotment and issue of New Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company pursuant to the Conversion, the Placing and the separate Subscription and Retail Offer being made by the Company or the issue of shares or\u00a0the grant and exercise of options pursuant to the option schemes, agreements and arrangements disclosed in the Circular).\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that the exercise by Cavendish of any power to grant consent to the undertaking by the Company of a transaction which would otherwise be subject to these restrictions under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of Cavendish and that it need not make any reference to, or consult with, any Placee and that it shall have no liability to any Placee whatsoever in connection with any such exercise of the power to grant consent.\nRepresentations, warranties and further terms\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) irrevocably represents, warrants, acknowledges, undertakes and agrees (for itself and for any such prospective Placee) that in each case as a fundamental term of such Placee's application for Placing Shares (save where Cavendish expressly agrees in writing to the contrary) that:\n1\nit has read and understood this Announcement in its entirety and that its acquisition of the Placing Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, indemnities, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained herein and that it has not relied on, and will not rely on, any information given or any representations, warranties or statements made at any time by any person in connection with Admission, the Placing, the Company, the Placing Shares or otherwise, other than the information contained in this Announcement and the Publicly Available Information;\n2 it has not received a prospectus or other offering document in connection with the Placing and acknowledges that no prospectus or other offering document: (a) is required under the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation;

If it is within a member state of the EEA, it is a Qualified Investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. For such purposes, it undertakes that it will acquire, hold, manage and (if applicable) dispose of any Placing Shares that are allocated to it for the purposes of its business only;\n27 it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and it will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) relating to Placing Shares in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not require approval of the communication by an authorised person and it acknowledges that this Announcement is not being issued by Cavendish as an authorised person under Section 21 of FSMA and therefore is not subject to the same controls applicable to a financial promotion made by an authorised person;\n28 it has complied and it will comply with all applicable laws with respect to anything done by it or on its behalf in relation to the Placing Shares (including all relevant provisions of the FSMA in respect of anything done in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom);\n29 if it is a financial intermediary, as that term is used in Article 5(1) of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the Prospectus Regulation, the Placing Shares acquired by it in the Placing will not be acquired on a non-discretionary basis on behalf of, nor will they be acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in the UK or in a Relevant State other than Qualified Investors, or in circumstances in which the express prior written consent of Cavendish has been given to the offer or resale;\n30 it has neither received nor relied on any confidential price sensitive information about the Company in accepting this invitation to participate in the Placing;\n31 neither Cavendish nor any of its affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees or any person acting on behalf of any of them has or shall have any liability for any information, representation or statement contained in this Announcement or for any information previously published by or on behalf of the Company or any other written or oral information made available to or publicly available or filed information or any representation, warranty or undertaking relating to the Company, and will not be liable for its decision to participate in the Placing based on any information, representation, warranty or statement contained in this Announcement or elsewhere, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall exclude any liability of any person for fraud;\n32 neither the Company nor Cavendish, nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees or any person acting on behalf of the Company, Cavendish or their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees is making any recommendations to it, advising it regarding the suitability of any transactions it may enter into in connection with the Placing nor providing advice in relation to the Placing nor in respect of any representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements, undertakings, or indemnities contained in the Placing Agreement nor the exercise or performance of Cavendish' rights and obligations thereunder including any rights to waive or vary any conditions or exercise any termination right;\n33 it acknowledges and accepts that Cavendish may, in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions, engage in transactions in relation to the Placing Shares and/or related instruments for its own account for the purpose of hedging its underwriting exposure or otherwise and, except as required by applicable law or regulation, Cavendish will not make any public disclosure in relation to such transactions;\n34 Cavendish and each of its affiliates, each acting as an investor for its or their own account(s), may bid or subscribe for and/or purchase Placing Shares and, in that capacity, may retain, purchase, offer to sell or otherwise deal for its or their own account(s) in the Placing Shares, any other securities of the Company or other related investments in connection with the Placing or otherwise. Accordingly, references in this Announcement to the Placing Shares being offered, subscribed, acquired or otherwise dealt with should be read as including any offer to, or subscription, acquisition or dealing by Cavendish and/or any of its affiliates, acting as an investor for its or their own account(s). Neither the Company nor Cavendish intend to disclose the extent of any such investment or transaction otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so;\n35 it is aware of the obligations (i) regarding insider dealing in the Criminal Justice Act 1993, FSMA, MAR and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and confirms that it has and will continue to comply with those obligations; and (ii) otherwise arising under the Regulations;\n36 in order to ensure compliance with the Regulations, either Cavendish (for itself and as agent on behalf of the Company) or the Registrars may, in their absolute discretion, require verification of its identity. Pending the provision to Cavendish or the Registrars, as applicable, of evidence of identity, definitive certificates in respect of the Placing Shares may be retained at Cavendish's absolute discretion or, where appropriate, delivery of the Placing Shares to it in uncertificated form may be delayed at either Cavendish's or the Registrars', as the case may be, absolute discretion. If within a reasonable time after a request for verification of identity, Cavendish (for itself and as agent on behalf of the Company) or the Registrars have not received evidence satisfactory to them, Cavendish and/or the Company may, at their absolute discretion, terminate their commitment in respect of the Placing, in which event the monies payable on acceptance of allotment will, if already paid, be returned without interest to the account of the drawee's bank from which they were originally debited;\n37 it acknowledges that its commitment to acquire Placing Shares on the terms set out in this Announcement and in the form of confirmation will continue notwithstanding any amendment that may in future be made to the terms and conditions of the Placing and that Placees will have no right to be consulted or require that their consent be obtained with respect to the Company's or Cavendish's conduct of the Placing;\n38 it has knowledge and experience in financial, business and international investment matters as is required to evaluate the merits and risks of subscribing for the Placing Shares. It further acknowledges that it is experienced in investing in securities of this nature and is aware that it may be required to bear, and is able to bear, the economic risk of, and is able to sustain, a complete loss in connection with the Placing. It has relied upon its own examination and due diligence of the Company and its affiliates taken as a whole, and the terms of the Placing, including the merits and risks involved;\n39 it irrevocably appoints any duly authorised officer of Cavendish as its agent for the purpose of executing and delivering to the Company and/or its Registrars any documents on its behalf necessary to enable it to be registered as the holder of any of the Placing Shares for which it agrees to subscribe or purchase upon the terms of this Announcement;\n40 the Company, Cavendish and others (including each of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees) will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representations, warranties, acknowledgements and agreements, which are given to Cavendish, on its behalf and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable;\n41 if it is acquiring the Placing Shares as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it has full power and authority to make, and does make, the foregoing representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings on behalf of each such accounts;\n42 time is of the essence as regards its obligations under this Appendix;\n43 any document that is to be sent to it in connection with the Placing will be sent at its risk and may be sent to it at any address provided by it to Cavendish;\n44 the Placing Shares will be issued subject to the terms and conditions of this Appendix; and\n45 these terms and conditions in this Appendix and all documents into which this Appendix is incorporated by reference or otherwise validly forms a part and/or any agreements entered into pursuant to these terms and conditions and all agreements to acquire Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Placing will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law and it submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any claim, dispute or matter arising out of any such contract, except that enforcement proceedings in respect of the obligation to make payment for the Placing Shares (together with any interest chargeable thereon) may be taken by the Company or Cavendish in any jurisdiction in which the relevant Placee is incorporated or in which any of its securities have a quotation on a recognised stock exchange.\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) agrees to indemnify and hold the Company, Cavendish and each of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers and employees harmless from any and all costs, claims, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with any breach of the representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings given by the Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) in this Appendix or incurred by the Company, Cavendish or each of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees arising from the performance of the Placee's obligations as set out in this Announcement, and further agrees that the provisions of this Appendix shall survive after the completion of the Placing.\nThe agreement to allot and issue Placing Shares to Placees (or the persons for whom Placees are contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax in the United Kingdom relates only to their allotment and issue to Placees, or such persons as they nominate as their agents, direct by the Company. Such agreement assumes that the Placing Shares are not being acquired in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement related to any other dealings in the Placing Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax may be payable. In that event, the Placee agrees that it shall be responsible for such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax and neither of the Company nor Cavendish shall be responsible for such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and they should notify Cavendish accordingly. In addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any capital duty, stamp duty and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) payable outside the United Kingdom by them or any other person on the acquisition by them of any Placing Shares or the agreement by them to acquire any Placing Shares and each Placee, or the Placee's nominee, in respect of whom (or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such non-United Kingdom stamp, registration, documentary, transfer or similar taxes or duties undertakes to pay such taxes and duties, including any interest and penalties (if applicable), forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company and Cavendish in the event that either the Company and/or Cavendish has incurred any such liability to such taxes or duties.\nThe representations, warranties, acknowledgements and undertakings contained in this Appendix are given to Cavendish for itself and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable.\nEach Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges that Cavendish does not owe any fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings, acknowledgements, agreements or indemnities in the Placing Agreement.\nEach Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges and agrees that Cavendish may (at its absolute discretion) satisfy its obligations to procure Placees by itself agreeing to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the Placing Shares or by nominating any connected or associated person to do so.\nWhen a Placee or any person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with Cavendish, any money held in an account with Cavendish on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money within the meaning of the relevant rules and regulations of the FCA made under FSMA. Each Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules; as a consequence this money will not be segregated from Cavendish's money (as applicable) in accordance with the client money rules and will be held by it under a banking relationship and not as trustee.\nReferences to time in this Announcement are to London time, unless otherwise stated.\nAll times and dates in this Announcement may be subject to amendment.\nNo statement in this Announcement is intended to be a profit forecast, and no statement in this Announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of the Company for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share of the Company.\nThe price of shares and any income expected from them may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested upon disposal of the shares. Past performance is no guide to future performance, and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser.\nThe Placing Shares to be issued or sold pursuant to the Placing will not be admitted to trading on any stock exchange other than AIM.\nNeither the content of the Company's website nor any website accessible by hyperlinks on the Company's website is incorporated in, or
