In addition to patients with IPF and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (\"PPF\"), patients suffering from autoimmune ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or systemic scleroderma) also have a high-mortality progressive fibrotic disease course which is not currently adequately treated.\nIn addition to lung tissue from seven IPF patients, NXP002 has been studied in tissue from an autoimmune ILD explanted lung (in this case from a patient diagnosed with non-specific interstitial pneumonia or NSIP).\nThis data\nwas revisited to compare key biomarker changes in tissue in response to NXP002 treatment using an 'area under the curve' (AUC) based approach, considering total biomarker expression during the treatment period.\nThese new results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nA clear dose response to NXP002 was observed\nacross both extra cellular matrix (\"ECM\") biomarkers and pro-fibrotic mediators suggesting NXP002's activity in additional pathways to standards of care;\n\u00b7\nA consistent and significant effect of NXP002 was observed alone and in combination with\nstandards of care\nacross both biomarker types in all donors;\n\u00b7\nWhen the Col1A1 gene was found to be overexpressed in tissue, representing active fibrotic disease and tissue turner, NXP002 consistently attenuates it's expression. When Col1A1 is not overexpressed Col1A1 is maintained, which may point towards NXP002's role in ECM homeostasis and supporting healthy tissue repair and regeneration, consistent with the evidence base describing positive results from clinical studies of tranilast in a range of fibrotic diseases; and\n\u00b7\nThe autoimmune-ILD donor studied also showed a significant response across both biomarker types alongside the seven IPF donors confirming that NXP002's activity translates well to autoimmune-derived ILDs.\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director, Nuformix, said:\n\"The PCLS lung tissue model has become the gold-standard disease model thanks to various close-to-patient benefits. We believe the dataset we have generated,\nin what we believe is one of the largest IPF patient tissue sample sets studied, gives us great confidence in NXP002. In what is a highly variable and heterogenous disease, to see such consistent activity across all donors towards pro-fibrotic mediators in both IPF and autoimmune ILD is impressive. The emergence of data supporting additional activity towards Col1A1 overexpression is exciting because this profile would be in contrast to high-potency, single target therapeutics, whose activity may negatively impact healthy tissue repair processes, leading to increased risk in long term use as observed in numerous recent IPF clinical studies\n. For patients with ILD's of an autoimmune origin, g\niven such patients' background systemic therapies, an inhaled approach towards treatment would be highly advantageous in both development and treatment. We are excited by the results and continue discussions with potential partners, who also see advantages in NXP002 in terms of therapeutic optionality and future product positioning. I look forward to providing further updates in due course.\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nCMC Markets\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.

We operate a lean structure with the limited Board and bring in specialists and consultants, experts in their field, to support the business as required.\nPipeline\nNuformix has an early-stage pipeline of preclinical assets in development to address the high unmet medical need in fibrosis and oncology. We target solutions using our expertise to develop and file patent applications on novel crystalline forms of existing, marketed drugs, that have improved physical properties, with the aim of developing novel products in new indications to create attractive commercial opportunities. Importantly, the commercial opportunity is optimised when the repurposed product is differentiated from the original marketed drug by way of either dose, route of administration or presentation.\nDrug repurposing is a well-known and successful strategy for enhancing the therapeutic and commercial value of marketed drugs, and their development typically brings a greater probability of success compared to developing newly discovered drugs, due to the existing data that has been generated on the marketed drug. This existence of data may also result in lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines.\nThe Group's business model is to take these assets to key value inflection points before partnering or licensing. We conduct our R&D activities through out-sourcing, to enable us to access the different types of expertise that are needed for drug R&D and to minimise our operational costs. We have a strong network of external contractors, with whom we have had relationships over many years.\nNXP002 (novel proprietary form of tranilast) - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"IPF\")\nNXP002 is the Group's preclinical lead asset and a potential novel inhaled treatment for IPF and possibly other fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (\"ILDs\"). It is a proprietary, new form of the drug tranilast, which allows the drug to be delivered in an inhaled formulation.\nIPF is a devastating lung disease associated with a higher mortality rate than many cancers. Thus, IPF represents a high unmet medical need such that the requirement for improved treatment options represents a significant commercial opportunity. IPF is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$8.8bn by 2027. Sales of standard-of-care therapies OFEV and Esbriet (now off patent) achieved US$3.5bn and US$0.8bn respectively in 2022.\nTranilast has a long history of safe use as an oral drug for asthma, keloids and hypertrophic scarring, but there is growing evidence that supports its potential use in other fibrotic conditions, including IPF. NXP002 is differentiated as it is a patent protected new form of tranilast that has been enabled for formulation and delivery direct to the lungs by inhalation, a new route of administration for this drug. The inhalation route is a well-known strategy for treatment of lung diseases to yield greater efficacy and reduce systemic side-effects compared to oral treatment. Discontinuation rates for standard-of-care IPF therapies can be as high as 80% in certain patient groups due to their debilitating systemic side-effects.\nEffective inhalation therapies offer the potential to overcome these limitations of oral therapies. Nuformix owns granted patents protecting new forms of tranilast, in addition to a recently filed patent protecting its use with SoC in IPF, with patent prosecution progressing in major pharmaceutical territories.\nAs a potential treatment for IPF, which is a rare disease, NXP002 is a likely candidate for Orphan Drug Designation, which could provide additional product protection against potential competitors. The positioning of NXP002 as an inhaled treatment for IPF could be either as added to Standards of Care (SoCs) or administered as a monotherapy\nfor patients non-responsive to SoCs and those declining these therapies due to side effects which impact quality of life.\nThe preclinical inhalation strategy,\ninitiated\nby the Company has significantly progressed NXP002 demonstrating:\n\u00b7\nit can be delivered\nin-vivo\nby a range of nebulisers at the optimum particle size for delivery to the deep lung;\n\u00b7\nvery high doses appear to be well-tolerated; and\n\u00b7\nan\nin-vivo\ninhalation dose response was observed for inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers that is consistent with all\nex-vivo\nhuman IPF tissue studies to date.\nThe Company conducted\nstudies in a new iteration of a 3D human IPF lung tissue using a disease and species relevant model that has been\nadvanced to significantly reduce output variability\n.\nThe results from these studies\nof NXP002 alone and in combination with current SoC, can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 is well tolerated in ex-vivo human lung tissue with no signs of toxicity events;\n\u00b7\nN\nXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of fibrosis and inflammatio\n\u00b7\nboth high and low concentrations of NXP002 show an additive anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect to SoC;\n\u00b7\nin particular, the higher concentrations of NXP002 with SoC's deliver a near complete ablation of fibrosis biomarker release, yet at lower concentrations than have been seen in other preclinical models to date; an\nd\n\u00b7\nthe clear, pronounced additive benefit of NXP002 on top of SoCs observed suggests that NXP002 will provide additional efficacy, even in patients responding to SoC therapy. This raises the possibility that NXP002 targets additional disease pathways to SoC's when increasing the combined anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory response.\nAs announced on 18 May 2023,\nfollowing success in suppressing biomarkers of fibrotic disease progression in\nhuman IPF lung tissue\n, the same samples were analysed to assess additional mechanistic and anti-inflammatory benefits on top of SoC's\nand the results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002\nalone delivers a strong, consistent anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines by over 90% for all cytokines studied; and\n\u00b7\nthe results further suggests that NXP002 will provide additional efficacy in combination with SoC's, even in patients responding to SoC therapy alone.\nNuformix has developed a Target Product Profile (\"TPP\") that is consistent with twice daily inhalation administration.\nTo assess NXP002's duration of action in relation to the TTP, the Company initiated work in an exploratory model in healthy human lung tissue. The model also bridges the Company's successful preclinical work across a variety of LPS-challenge studies.\nThe results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by healthy human lung tissue following LPS challenge; and\n\u00b7\na strong anti-inflammatory effect remains at 12 hours post drug dosing demonstrated by continued suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines following LPS challenge, confirming NXP002 has a suitable duration of action to support its TTP of twice daily dosing.\nOverall, the results further strengthen NXP002's potential for development as a new inhaled treatment for IPF either in addition to existing therapies or as a monotherapy.\nThe Board continues to be encouraged by the progress of the studies and the positive data generated to date, in particular the recent duration of action study results and is focused on next steps which include:\n\u00b7\nexpansion of the current studies to include further human IPF tissue donors to demonstrate the robustness of NXP002's anti-fibrotic response alone and in SoC combinations; and\n\u00b7\nformally commencing the NXP002 partnering process.\nPost-period end on 23 October 2023, the Company announced that it was issued with an Official Decision to Grant Notice of Allowance for\nJapanese National Phase Patent Application No.\n2020-555115\nentitled \"CRYSTALLINE TRANILAST SALTS AND THEIR PHARMACEUTICAL USE\".\nThis patent, which has already been granted in the US, describes proprietary new forms of the drug tranilast being progressed by the Company as a potential novel IPF treatment. These proprietary drug forms uniquely enable delivery via an inhaled nebulised formulation.\nNXP004 (novel forms of olaparib) - Oncology\nThe Group discovered novel forms of olaparib, a drug currently marketed by AstraZeneca, as Lynparza\u00ae. Lynparza\u00ae was first approved in December 2014 for the treatment of adults with advanced ovarian cancer and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation. Since then, it has secured similar approvals in breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers with further trials on-going. These approvals have propelled Lynparza\u00ae sales to US$2.6bn in 2022 with industry analysts forecasting annual sales of US$9.7bn by 2028.\nThe Group has filed two patent applications on its novel forms of olaparib with the potential for patent life to 2040/2041.\nThe Company demonstrated enhanced performance of NXP004 cocrystals compared to olaparib. Subsequently, further preformulation studies allowed the Company to identify lead cocrystals to be progressed for further development.\nResults from\nin vitro\ndissolution studies demonstrated that the two lead NXP004 cocrystals out-performed Lynparza\n\u00ae\n, both in terms of rate and extent of dissolution and release of olaparib.\nEnhancement of dissolution in the currently marketed formulation of Lynparza\n\u00ae\nresulted in improved bioavailability versus the initial marketed product. Therefore, the NXP004 programme may offer potential to further increase olaparib bioavailability. In addition, the potential simplicity of NXP004-based formulations may offer improvements in product cost-of-goods versus the currently marketed product, which requires complex manufacturing methods.\nThese attributes position NXP004 for applications in line-extensions for the currently marketed product, or for possible development in future first-to-generic products.\nThe Company will now consider the design and execution of\nsuitable preclinical pharmacokinetic models to further investigate and validate NXP004's potential for enhancing the oral absorption of olaparib. Securing these data will enable commencement of discussions with\npotential commercialisation partners.\nThis work will direct and support future out-licensing discussions for NXP004.\nNXP001 (new form of aprepitant) - Oncology\nNXP001 is a proprietary new form of the drug aprepitant that is currently marketed as a product in the oncology supportive care setting (chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting) exclusively licensed to Oxilio for oncology indications.\nOn 18 September 2023, the Company announced that Oxilio had acquired\nownership of its NXP001 patent estate\nfor which\nNuformix\nreceived new immediate and near-term undisclosed milestone payments\n, whilst retaining further development milestones and royalties capped at \u00a32 million per year.\nFundraising\nOn 13 April 2023, the Company completed a subscription to raise gross proceeds of \u00a370,000 through a subscription for 35,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each in the capital of the Company (the \"New Ordinary Shares\") at a price of 0.20 pence per share (the \"Subscription\"). The Subscription was undertaken with a single UK-based FCA regulated institutional investor. The New Ordinary Shares represented approximately 4.7 per cent. of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nIn addition, the participant in the Subscription was issued with one warrant for every one New Ordinary Share subscribed for with an exercise price of 0.25 pence per warrant. These warrants are exercisable for two years from 21 April 2023 (\"Warrants\"). If the Warrants are exercised in full, it would result in the issue of an additional 35,000,000 new ordinary shares raising a further \u00a387,500 for the progression of the Company's business activities. The New Ordinary Shares and Warrants were issued pursuant to the Company's existing share issuance authorities.\nThe net proceeds of the Subscription are being used by the Company primarily to further advance its NXP002 programme for the inhaled treatment of IPF.\nLanstead Subscription and Sharing Agreements\nDuring the period the Company received proceeds from\nthe Company's subscription and associated sharing arrangements with\nLanstead Capital Investors L.P. (\"Lanstead\"), as announced on\n14 December 2021\n,\n17 January 2022 and 12 April 2022. The sharing agreements ended in October 2023, concluding this arrangement and the Company is due no further funds from Lanstead.\nBusiness Development\nDuring the period the Company has switched its focus to business development activities to explore partnering opportunities for both its NXP002 and NXP004 programmes, attending both the European Respiratory Conference in Milan and the IPF Summit in Boston. Those partnering activities are ongoing.\nSummary and Outlook\nThe strategy of the Group is to continue to optimise value from its existing assets while maintaining tight control of costs. The proceeds from the Lanstead Sharing Agreements, the April 2023 fundraise proceeds and the milestone payment received from Oxilio in September 2023 and post-period in December 2023 have enabled the Group to continue to advance and exploit the current assets within the portfolio through selective additional R&D and business development activities as set out above. The Group is conducting business development/licensing activities for all its assets using a structured and data-driven approach, with the goal of seeking global licensing deals. Our focus and emphasis is to progress our NXP002 and NXP004 programmes where required to complete licensing transactions and achieve value creation to generate a return for shareholders.\nWe would like to thank all stakeholders and in particular our shareholders for their continued support and we look forward to the remainder of the year and beyond with confidence that significant value can be realised from our portfolio of assets over time.\nJulian Gilbert Madeleine Kennedy\nNon-Executive Chairman Non-Executive Director\n2 January 2024 2 January 2024\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nStanford Capital Partners Limited\nTom Price / Patrick Claridge (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3650\nBob Pountney (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3652\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing. The Company aims to use its expertise in discovering, developing and patenting novel drug forms, with improved physical properties, to develop new products in new indications that are, importantly, differentiated from the original (by way of dosage, delivery route or presentation), thus creating new and attractive commercial opportunities. Nuformix has a pipeline of preclinical assets with potential for significant value and early licensing opportunities.\nStrategic Report\nReview of the Business\nA review of the period of these accounts is given in the Non-Executive Directors' Statement above.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe Group's risk management policy is regularly reviewed and updated in line with the changing needs of the business. Risk is inherent in all business. Set out below are certain risk factors which could have an impact on the Group's long-term performance and mitigating factors adopted to alleviate these risks. This does not purport to be an exhaustive list of the risks affecting the Group.\nThe primary risks identi?ed by the Board are:\nStrategic risks\n\u00b7\nFunding the business\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are very competitive, with many major players having substantial R&D departments with greater resources and ?nancial support. The Group aims to execute licensing deals early in the development process in order to generate revenue to support the business. The Group's lead asset is targeted towards IPF, a disease area where there is good precedent for licensing deals at early stages of development. Without licensing revenue, reliance falls on raising funds from investors or potential M&A opportunities. Failure to generate additional funding from these sources, if required, would compromise the Group's ability to achieve its strategic objectives as set out in the outlook on page 6. There is a material uncertainty around achieving early licensing deals and, if needed, raising additional funds. However, it is the Directors' reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of the approval of the accounts. In forming this assessment, the Directors have prepared cash?ow forecasts covering the period ending 31 December 2024 that take into account the likely run rate on overheads and research and development expenditure and the prudent expectations of income from out-licensing rights to its programmes or a fundraising.\nThe proceeds from the Lanstead sharing agreements ended in October 2023\n\u00b7\nFeasibility of drug candidates\nPharmaceutical R&D is an inherently risky activity and drug candidates can fail due to a lack of ef?cacy, lack of potency, unsuitable pharmacokinetic properties, unacceptable toxicology profile, poor stability of the drug or formulation, poor performance of the drug product, or other technical issues unforeseen at the time of candidate selection. This is the main reason that conventional pharmaceutical R&D takes many years and billions of dollars to progress a drug from discovery through to an approved medicine. It is possible that the drug candidates selected by the Group are found to be non- viable for further development although the Group's model of repurposing and working on known drugs allows us to mitigate this risk to a certain extent.\n\u00b7\nFailure to generate and protect our IP\nIf our IP rights are not adequately secured or defended against infringement, or conversely become subject to infringement claims by others, commercial exploitation could be completely inhibited. The Group constantly monitors its patents and is prepared to defend them rigorously.\nBy virtue of conducting research on known drugs, competitors may file patent applications on the same drugs as the Group, and thus there is a risk of securing new granted patents. There is a delay of up to 18 months in publishing patent applications and thus it is not always known whether the Group's inventions will be novel. This is mitigated through knowledge and expertise in identifying new IP and promptly filing patent applications.\n\u00b7\nUnrealistic goals and timeframes\nThe Board has a duty to maintain a realistic view of the chances of success of products, deals and partnerships. Should this not be managed accurately and appropriately, the Group and its Board and staff risk ?nancial, business and reputational damage, whilst its shareholders become exposed to investment risk and uncertainty over the Group's viability and status. The Board continually reviews expectations and communications in the public domain to reduce the risk of misalignment.\n\u00b7\nReliance on partners\nTo progress the development of a drug candidate requires resources, ?nancial and otherwise, that are not necessarily available to the Group. The drug candidates that the Group wishes to develop may be of interest to third parties capable of providing these resources, so a partnership (e.g., a co-development partnership) may provide mutual bene?ts and mitigate risks for the Group. However, the speci?c strategic focus of a partner may not align totally with the Group's objectives. Maintaining a balance in a partnership is therefore a risk, such as timing, cost sharing, development decisions. Currently the Group is progressing two of its three pipeline assets without external co-development partners and thus this risk is currently minimised.\nOperational risks\n\u00b7\nManagement, employees, consultants and contractors\nWith a fully virtual Group operating model with a reliance on consultants and contractors, the Group's ability to manage day to day tasks and its relationships with its customers and suppliers could be undermined by failure to recruit key personnel. The Group endeavours to offer attractive remuneration and a positive working environment for all people involved in its projects. The Board are incentivised as detailed in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\u00b7\nBusiness development risks in terms of timing and success of deal ?ow\nOpportunities to generate value from the portfolio have increased, but there is a need to generate further data to make the assets as attractive as possible to potential licensees. The Group seeks to extract value from its existing pipeline through early licensing deals once sufficient data are generated, to provide revenue. Generation of more robust data packages will lead to a greater probability of successful licensing discussions.\n\u00b7\nAdapting to the external environment\nThe ability of the Group to quickly adapt to external events such as a pandemic may impact the delivery of our strategy. The pandemic could cause further impact to external research. Our primary focus remains the safety of our employees. The Group follows Government advice whilst allowing employees to work ?exibly. The risks are also minimised by the Group's virtual business model, allowing the Board to work remotely and effectively. Close liaison with contractors ensures that Group projects are progressed according to agreed timelines and costs.\nFinancial risk management\n\u00b7\nFailure to achieve strategic plans or meet targets or expectations\nThe Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure an optimal capital structure and equity holder returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital ef?ciency, prevailing and projected pro?tability, projected operating cash ?ows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. Further detail on the Group's risk management policies and procedures are set out in Note 18 of the ?nancial statements.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nNet assets at year-end (18 months) of \u00a34,195,033 (2022: \u00a34,737,962) which includes \u00a3202,548 cash at bank (2022: \u00a3464,095)\n\u00b7\nThe Group delivered a loss on ordinary activities (after tax credit) for the 18 months of \u00a3859,467 (2022: loss of \u00a31,108,993) and a loss per share of 0.12p (2022: 0.19p). The reported loss is driven mainly by costs related to the further development of pipeline assets\nFuture outlook\nThe Non-Executive Directors' Statement above gives information on the outlook of the Group.\nPerformance\nThe following are the key performance indicators (\"KPIs\") considered by the Board in assessing the Group's performance against its objectives. These KPIs are:\nFinancial KPIs\nThe Group is currently at a stage where the Board considers availability of cash to fund the planned R&D activities to be the primary KPI. At 30 September 2023 cash balances totalled \u00a3202,548 (2022: \u00a3464,095). The Board will consider introducing additional KPIs to monitor the Group's development as they become relevant in the future.\n\u00b7\nMeeting ?nancial targets:\nThe Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure an optimal capital structure and equity holder returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital ef?ciency, prevailing and projected pro?tability, projected operating cash ?ows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. Further detail on the Group's risk management policies and procedures are set out in Note 18 of the ?nancial statements.\n\u00b7\nRevenue from agreements:\nDuring the period of these accounts, the revised Oxilio agreement has provided Nuformix with\nnew immediate and near-term undisclosed milestone payments\n.\nNon-Financial KPIs\n\u00b7\nProgress of Lead Programmes:\nThe Group strategy is to generate revenue streams through applying and further developing its IP to produce proprietary product opportunities for short-term development and early out-licensing opportunities. Thus, progression of its assets towards licensing is crucial to the business.\nNXP002: During the period of these accounts the Group continued to prioritise the development of NXP002, its inhaled candidate for the treatment for IPF, and generated further preclinical data.\nThe Group\nfirstly initiated further preclinical studies confirming preclinical tolerability across a new range of higher doses than previously studied following inhalation of a new nebulised formulation. In response to intelligence gathered following the attendance of key conferences, the Group switched its research focus onto further investigations of NXP002 in combination with current IPF standards of care (SoC) and demonstration of NXP002's duration of action.\nThis was achieved via new studies in 3D human lung tissue, firstly using a disease and species relevant IPF model, focusing on NXP002 in combination with current SoC.\nAdvancements within this model were designed to significantly reduce output variability. The results continued to confirm\nthat\nNXP002 is well tolerated in ex-vivo human lung tissue with no signs of toxicity events and that\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-fibrotic effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of fibrosis. Furthermore, both high and low concentrations of NXP002 show an additive anti-fibrotic effect to SoC. In particular, the higher concentrations of NXP002 with SoC's deliver a near complete ablation of fibrosis and inflammation biomarker release, yet at lower concentrations than have been seen in other preclinical models to date.\nThe results indicated that the clear, pronounced additive benefit of NXP002 on top of SoCs observed offers the potential for additional IPF treatment efficacy, even in patients responding to SoC therapy. The results also raised the possibility that NXP002 targets additional disease pathways to SoC's when increasing the combined anti-fibrotic response.\nLastly, the Group initiated work using an exploratory healthy human lung tissue model to investigate NXP002's duration of action. Demonstration of a prolonged duration of action is essential in the development of inhaled therapies, whose clearance from the lung can be rapid. Therapies requiring multiple (more than two) daily uses of inhalation devices for effective treatment are less attractive and suffer reduced patient compliance, even in life-threatening conditions such as IPF. Therefore,\u00a0Nuformix\u00a0has developed a TPP that is consistent with twice daily inhalation administration.\nThe exploratory model involves an LPS challenge to healthy human lung tissue, offering numerous advantages in terms of species relevance and the ability to control tissue exposure to drug. The model also bridges the Company's previous successful preclinical work across a variety of LPS-challenge studies.\nIt was found that\nNXP002 suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by healthy human lung tissue following LPS challenge.\nThis effect was seen at one hour post treatment with NXP002, suggesting only a short time is required for lung tissue penetration and activity. In addition, a strong anti-inflammatory effect remained at 12 hours post drug dosing demonstrated by suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines following\nLPS challenge, confirming NXP002 has a suitable duration of action. Lastly, results indicated that anti-inflammatory effect was still observed at 24 hours post removal of drug.\nOverall, the combined data generated gives the Group confidence in NXP002's potential as an inhaled therapy for IPF treatment and allows the telling of a more complete preclinical story to potential licensing partners for the first time. The Group continues to pursue opportunities to share this important new data with key players in the rare disease and respiratory disease sectors as it explore all opportunities to progress the NXP002 programme.\nNXP001:\nOn 18 September 2023, the Company announced Oxilio had acquired\nownership of its NXP001 patent estate\nfor which\nNuformix\nreceived new immediate and near-term undisclosed milestone payments\n, whilst retaining further development milestones and royalties capped at\u00a0\u00a32 million\u00a0per year.\nNXP004: During the period of these accounts, the Group continued to perform preclinical studies investigating\nthe enhanced performance of NXP004 cocrystals compared to various forms of olaparib. Pre-formulation studies were first completed confirming the superiority of the Group's recently patented cocrystal forms, allowing lead cocrystals to be identified and progressed to further drug product development studies.\nThe Group initiated\nin-vitro\ndissolution performance studies for its lead cocrystals compared to the marketed Lynparza\n\u00ae\ntablet product using a biologically relevant dissolution design and with drug loading relevant to human dosing.\nThe results demonstrated that the two lead NXP004 cocrystals selected out-perform Lynparza\n\u00ae\n, both in terms of rate and extent of dissolution and release of olaparib.\nEnhancement of dissolution in the currently marketed formulation of Lynparza\n\u00ae\nresulted in improved bioavailability versus the initial marketed product. Therefore, the NXP004 programme may offer potential to further increase olaparib bioavailability. In addition, the potential simplicity of NXP004-based formulations may offer improvements in product cost-of-goods versus the currently marketed product, which requires complex manufacturing methods.\nThese attributes position NXP004 for applications in line-extensions for the currently marketed product, or for possible development in future first-to-generic products.\nThe Company has commenced discussions with\npotential commercialisation partners.\nCo-development with third parties:\nCo-development of generic products with third parties, where Nuformix's knowhow or IP could provide extended patent protection is a potential business model although the Group is prioritising its resources on progressing its own portfolio to generate licensing revenue.\nSection 172\nThe Board considers the interests of the Group's employees and other stakeholders, including the impact of its activities on the community, environment and the Group's reputation, when making decisions. The Board ensures that its decisions offer the best chance to promote the success of the Group as a whole and consider the likely and long-term consequences for all stakeholders, particularly (though not exclusively) considering the following:\n\u00b7\nHow the views and interests of all stakeholders were represented in the boardroom during the period of these accounts. Open and honest discussion at Board level considers the impact on the Group's stakeholders when reviewing items ?owing to the Board as part of its activities, whether this is reviewing strategy, budget or a business development opportunity.\n\u00b7\nGiven the size and stage of development of the Group, the Board has not formally adopted a mechanism to obtain stakeholder feedback. However, the Group's Directors can be contacted at info@nuformix.com should any stakeholders wish to contact the Group and shareholders may contact the Company's investor relations adviser, IFC Advisory Limited, at nuformix@investor-focus.co.uk.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's strategy and business model detailed in the Non-Executive Directors' Statement above.\n\u00b7\nHow the Group manages risks, on pages 9 to 15 of the Annual Report.\n\u00b7\nCorporate governance, on pages 17 to 22 of the Annual Report, including how governance supported the delivery of our strategic objectives in this period.\nCarbon Reporting\nThe Group has opted not to include any Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) within this report as it does not meet the Large Company threshold or energy consumption threshold requiring additional reporting.\nStatement of Directors' Responsibilities\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by law to prepare the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing the Company and Group's financial statements, Companies Act 2006 requires that Directors:\n\u00b7\nSelect suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n\u00b7\nMake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n\u00b7\nState whether applicable under UK-adopted international accounting standards, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ?nancial statements; and\n\u00b7\nPrepare the ?nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are suf?cient to show and explain the Group transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ?nancial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the ?nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nIn the case of each person who was a director at the time of this report was approved:\n\u00b7\nSo far as that Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditor is unaware; and\n\u00b7\nThat Director has taken all steps that the director ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditor is aware of that information.\nAuditors\nKreston Reeves LLP were appointed as auditors in the period, and a resolution to reappoint Kreston Reeves LLP as auditors will be presented to the members at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 485(2) of the Companies Act 2006.\nOn behalf of the board,\nDr Julian Gilbert Madeleine Kennedy\nNon-Executive Director Non-Executive Director\n2 January 2024\n2 January 2024\nIndependent Auditor's Report\nto the Shareholders of Nuformix plc\nFor the period ended 30 September 2023\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of Nuformix PLC (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') for the year ended 30 September 2023 which comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated and company statements of financial position, consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, consolidated statements of cashflow and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the United Kingdom in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 30 September 2023 and of the Group's loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the United Kingdom; and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty relating to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 2 in the financial statements, which indicates that there is a significant material uncertainty in relation to the going concern status of the group.\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company that has undertaken significant research into targeting the pharmaceutical product gap needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing. In order to complete this work, the company will need to expend significant, and currently unquantifiable, amounts that will be in excess of the cash held at the balance sheet date of \u00a3203k (2022: \u00a3464k).\nGiven the stage in the business life cycle the Group is incurring significant losses at present, totalling to \u00a3859k in the 18-month period ended 30 September 2023 (2022: year ended loss of \u00a31,109k) resulting in the group's accumulated losses at the balance sheet date of \u00a38,209k (2022: accumulated losses of \u00a37,350k). These losses are attributable to the ongoing drug research programme which is yet to reach commercial production stage where revenue could potentially be generated. The Group is therefore not in a position to self-finance and will require additional external funding which, at the date of this audit report, is unknown in quantum and not secured. Additionally, the ultimate likelihood of the development work being undertaken resulting in an effective product that is commercially viable is also unknown at this stage.\nAs a result of the material uncertainty with respect to going concern, we have completed the following audit work as part of our evaluation of going concern:\n\u00b7\nOverheads and debt costs assumptions - we considered projected overheads for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 periods to ensure that these were reasonable after considering both the current and expected future profile of the business moving forward. As part of this future profiling, the non-executive directors have elected not to take payment of their salaries until such time as the business holds sufficient funds to enable them to do so.\n\u00b7\nCredit / cash control management assumptions - we identified within the forecasting the most significant cash inflows and ensured that the valuation and timing of these were reasonable.\n\u00b7\nWe performed sensitivity analysis to assess the level of working capital headroom should key assumptions be less favourable than assumed in management's model.\n\u00b7\nWe considered post year end performance data available, including the group's future commitments, to gain additional assurance over the effectiveness of management's plans to ensure the Company and Group remain a going concern.\nBased on the work we have performed we have gained sufficient assurance in order to rely on management's forecasting in forming our assessment. We have also gained assurance over the credibility of management's budgeting strategy over the next 12 months.. This included gaining assurance over the adequacy of working capital available in order to settle external liabilities as they fall due. With respect to further funding of development we have reviewed the director's assessment that they can raise the funding required in the near-term through future share capital raises.\nHowever, whilst we have evaluated future cash inflows as reasonable for meeting current working capital needs, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the ultimate quantum and timing of funding required to reach the production stage and indeed the likelihood this stage will ever be reached. Should all or part of this funding not be received or one or both of their core projects NXP002 and NXP004 not succeed the valuation of the group's goodwill \u00a34,023,484 (2022: \u00a34,023,484), the parent company's valuation of the subsidiary investment \u00a34,023,484 (2022: \u00a34,023,484), the group's carrying value of other intangible assets \u00a357,793 (2022: \u00a3126,927) and ultimately the going concern assessment of the Group would be adversely affected.\nManagement will continue to reduce non-essential costs in the 2024 financial period and has signed an agreement to sell the ownership of the NXP001 patent estate, which allows them to focus on NXP002 and NXP004. As part of this agreement two milestone payments have been achieved and received in the bank since the year end. However, there are further larger milestone payments due, which are unlikely to be received into the bank in the foreseeable future.\nThe above indicates that a significant material uncertainty exists with respect to going concern. However, as we have obtained sufficient assurance over the availability of financial resources to settle liabilities as they fall due over a period of at least the next 12 months, our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nGroup revenue\nGroup profit/(loss) before tax\nGroup net assets\nFull statutory audit (Kreston Reeves)\n100%\n100%\n100%\nLimited procedures\n0\n0\n0\nTotals at 30 September 2023:\n100%\n100%\n100%\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\nOur scoping considerations for the Group audit were based both on financial information and risk. As noted above limited assurance audit work - which is to say the audit of balances and transactions material at a group level - was not utilised due to statutory audit requirements of all group entities. The below table summarises for the parent company and its subsidiaries, the level of assurance gained:\nGroup component\nLevel of assurance\nNuformix PLC\nFull statutory audit (Kreston Reeves LLP)\nNuformix Technologies Limited\nFull statutory audit (Kreston Reeves LLP)\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\nImpairment\nof goodwill / Valuation of investment:\nSignificance and nature of key risk\nThe Group has significant goodwill generated from an investment in subsidiary of \u00a34,023,484. In addition, the parent company holds an equal investment value of \u00a34,023,484 on it's company balance sheet relating to the same subsidiary.\nWe identified there was a risk in relation to the impairment on the goodwill / investment held with regards to the trading subsidiary.\nManagement's assessment of the recoverable amount of investment in a subsidiary requires estimation and judgement around assumptions used, including the cash flows to be generated from the continuing operations of the subsidiary. Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in the estimated recoverable amount, impacting the value of investment in the subsidiary and impairment charges.\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment on goodwill arising from business combination, goodwill is allocated to a single cash generating units ('CGU') and the recoverable amount of the CGU was determined with reference to value-in-use (the 'VIU') calculations using cash flow projections. In carrying out the impairment assessment, significant management judgement was used to determine the key assumptions underlying the VIU calculations.\nWe have identified the above matter as a key audit matter because goodwill is material to the Group and the valuation of the investment is material to the parent company. The estimation of recoverable amount of the CGU involved a significant degree of management judgement and therefore was subject to an inherent risk of error.\nHow our audit addressed the key risk\nDuring the course of the audit, we undertook the following key procedures:\n\u00b7\nassessing the appropriateness of the VIU calculations used by the management to estimate recoverable amount of CGU;\n\u00b7\nreconciling key input data applied in the VIU calculations to reliable supporting evidence; and\n\u00b7\nchallenging the reasonableness of key assumptions based on our knowledge and understanding of the business and industry.\n\u00b7\nReviewed management's plan of future operating cashflows of the subsidiary; and\n\u00b7\nobtaining evidence of the commercial and technical feasibility of the patents owned by the subsidiary.\nThere were also other procedures which are not deemed to be key and have therefore not been listed above.\nBased on the audit work performed, we are satisfied with management's valuation of goodwill and investment as featured within these financial statements.\nKey observations communicated to the Audit & Risk Committee\nWe have no significant concerns over the material accuracy of valuation / impairment of investment values recognised in the financial statements.\nOur application of materiality\nGroup financial statements\nParent company financial statements\nOverall Materiality\n\u00a398,100\n\u00a395,300\nHow we determined it\n2% of Group gross assets\n2% of Company gross assets\nRationale for benchmark\nThe group is focused on the development of its Intellectual Property (IP) and the assets held in order to finance the continuing development of this IP. As such, the most appropriate basis for the group financial statements is gross assets.\nThe parent company is principally holding subsidiary investment. The users of the financial statements will be most concerned with the value of investment. As such, the most appropriate basis for the parent company materiality is gross assets.\nWe reported all audit differences found in excess of our triviality threshold of \u00a34,900 to the directors and the management board as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nOther information\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of our knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement (set out on pages 29 and 30), the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.\nBased on our understanding\no\nf the\ngroup\nand industr\ny\n, and through discussion\nwit\nh the directors and other\nm\nanage\nm\nent\n(a\ns required by a\nuditin\ng standards),\nw\ne identified that the principal\nrisk\ns\no\nf non-compliance\nwith law\ns and regulations related to health and\nsafet\ny\n, anti-bribery and e\nm\nplo\ny\nm\nent\nlaw\n.\nW\ne\nconsidere\nd\nth\ne\nexten\nt\nto\nwhic\nh non-compliance\nm\ni\nght\nhav\ne a\nm\naterial\neffec\nt on the financial statements.\nW\ne also considered those\nlaws\nand regulations that\nhav\ne a direct\ni\nm\npact on the preparation\no\nf the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006, taxation and pension legislation.\nW\ne\nc\no\nmm\nunicated identified\nlaw\ns and regulations throughout our\ntea\nm\nand\nremained\nalert\nto\nany\ni\nndications\no\nf\nnon-compliance throughout\nthe\naudit.\nWe evaluated\nm\nanage\nm\nent's incentives and opportunities\nfo\nr fraudulent\nm\na\nnipulatio\nn\no\nf the financial statements (including the\nris\nk\no\nf override\no\nf controls) and determined that the principal\nrisk\ns\nwer\ne related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce expenditure and\nm\nanage\nm\nent bias\ni\nn accounting estimates and\njudgementa\nl\narea\ns\no\nf\nth\ne\nfinancia\nl\nstatement\ns\nsuc\nh\na\ns\nth\ne\nvaluatio\nn\no\nf\nintangible assets and investments\n.\nAudi\nt\nprocedure\ns\nperforme\nd\nb\ny\nthe group\nengage\nm\nent team included:\n\u00b7\nDiscussions with management and assessment of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud, and review of the reports made by\nm\nanage\nm\nent; and\n\u00b7\nAssessment of identified fraud risk factors; and\n\u00b7\nChallenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates; and\n\u00b7\nPerforming integrity testing to verify the legitimacy of banking records obtained from management; and\n\u00b7\nPerforming anal\ny\ntical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships, including related party transactions, that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and\n\u00b7\nConfirmation of related parties with management, and review of transactions throughout the period to identify any previously undisclosed transactions with related parties outside the normal course of business; and\n\u00b7\nPerforming analytical procedures with automated data analytics tools to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships, including related party transactions, that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and\n\u00b7\nReading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with relevant tax and regulatory authorities; and\n\u00b7\nReview of significant and unusual transactions and evaluation of the underl\ny\ning financial rationale supporting the transactions.\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\u00b7\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\u00b7\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\u00b7\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n\u00b7\nConclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\u00b7\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\u00b7\nObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nUse of our Report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nAnne Dwyer BSc(Hons) FCA (Senior Statutory Auditor)\nFor and on behalf of\nKreston Reeves LLP\nChartered Accountants\nStatutory Auditor\nLondon\nDate: 2 January 2024\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the Period Ended 30 September 2023\nNote\nPeriod ended\n30 September\n2023\n\u00a3\nYear ended\n31 March\n2022\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n3\n-\n50,000\nCost of sales\n-\n(1,695)\nGross pro?t\n-\n48,305\nAdministrative expenses\n(927,972)\n(1,318,577)\nOperating loss\n4\n(927,972)\n(1,270,272)\nLoss before tax\n(927,972)\n(1,270,272)\nIncome tax credit\n8\n68,505\n161,279\nLoss for the year and total comprehensive loss for the year\n(859,467)\n(1,108,993)\nLoss per share -

General information\nNuformix plc (\"the Company\") and its subsidiary (together, \"the Group\") operate in the ?eld of pharmaceutical development targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.\nThe Company is a public limited company which is listed on the Standard List of the London Stock Exchange, domiciled in the United Kingdom (\"the UK\") and incorporated in England and Wales.\nThe address of its registered of?ce is 6th Floor, 60 Gracechurch Street, London, EC3V 0HR.\nThe company operates in a virtual manner and as such does not have a principal place of business.\nThe company extended its accounting period from 31 March 2023 to 30 September 2023 to allow sufficient time to appoint new auditors. Due to this change the current year figures included in the statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and related notes represent 18 months of transactions in comparison to the 12 months represented in the previous period by the comparative.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nNuformix plc transitioned to UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in its Group and Parent Company financial statements on 1 April 2021. This change constitutes a change in accounting framework. However, there is no change on recognition, measurement or disclosure in the financial year reported as a result of the change in framework.\nThese Group and Parent Company financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards.\nThe financial statements of the Group and Parent Company have been prepared on accrual basis and under historical cost convention. The ?nancial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Group's functional and presentational currency.\nNew Standards and Interpretations\nNo new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the period beginning on or after 1 April 2022 have had a material impact on the Group.\nStandards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted are as follows:\nStandard\nImpact on initial application\nEffective date\nIAS 1\nClassification of liabilities as current or non-current\nNot earlier than 1 January 2024\nIAS 1\nDisclosure of accounting policies\n1 January 2023\nIAS 8\nAccounting estimates\n1 January 2023\nIAS 12\nIFRS 7\nIFRS 16\nDeferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction\nSupplier finance\nLeases on sale and leaseback\n1 January 2023\n1 January 2024\n1 January 2024\nIFRS 17\nIAS 21\nInsurance contracts\nLack of exchangeability\n1 January 2023\n1 January 2025\nThe Directors are evaluating the impact of the new and amended standards above. The Directors believe that these new and amended standards are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group\nGoing concern\nThe ?nancial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of preparation which, inter alia, is based on the Directors' reasonable expectation that the Group and Parent Company has adequate resources to continue to operate as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements. In forming this assessment, the Directors have prepared cash?ow forecasts covering the period ending 31 December 2024 that take into account the likely run rate on overheads and research and development expenditure and the estimates of the possibilities of raising funds through issues of equity and have considered alternative strategies should projected income be delayed or fail to materialise.\nThe Group is not in a position for self-financing and will require further funding which has not yet been secured. Whilst the Directors understand the risks and issues around raising further funds through an equity raise, this will be carefully considered, as and when appropriate.\nThese circumstances indicate the existence of an inherent material uncertainty which may cast a significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, when in twelve - eighteen months' time a thorough review of funding will be required. However, these scenarios have already been considered and will continue to be closely monitored by the Directors. The ?nancial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the company or Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Directors have carried out a thorough review of costs and are clear on the development work to be completed. Discretionary costs have been carefully reviewed and reduced where reasonable to do so while continuing to allow the prudent running of the business. In addition, the non-executive directors have elected not to take payment of their salaries until such time as the business holds sufficient funds to enable them to do so.\nAfter careful consideration, the Directors consider that they have reasonable grounds to believe that the Group can be regarded as a going concern and for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group's ?nancial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\nThe preparation of these ?nancial statements under UK-adopted International Accounting Standards requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the ?nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. These estimates and assumptions are based upon management's knowledge and experience of the amounts, events or actions. Actual results may differ from such estimates.\nThe critical accounting estimates are considered to relate to the following:\ni) Intangible assets\nThe Group recognises intangible assets in respect of goodwill arising on consolidation. This recognition requires the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions in determining whether the goodwill is impaired at each year end, using a NPV calculation assuming a 20% discount rate.\nii) Share options\nThe Group's fair values equity-settled share-based payment transactions using the Black-Scholes model. The use of the models involves judgements and estimates including an assessment of whether the shares will vest. Should actual future outcomes differ from these assessments the amounts recognised on a straight-line basis would vary from those currently recognised. The total charge in the period to 30 September 2023 was \u00a331,854.\niii) Basis of consolidation\nThe Group's financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiary as of 30 September 2023. Its subsidiary has a reporting date of 30 September.\nAll transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a Group perspective. Amounts reported in the financial statements of its subsidiary have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.\nProfit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.\niv) Business combinations\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their acquisition-date fair values.\nv) Revenue recognition\nRevenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in the ordinary course of the Group's activities. Revenue is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.\nThe Group recognises revenue when:\n?\nthe amount of revenue can be reliably measured;\n?\nit is probable that future economic bene?ts will ?ow to the entity; and,\n?\nspeci?c criteria have been met for each of the Group activities, such as the demonstration of milestone achievements in research or acceptance by both parties.\nAfter applying the above criteria, no revenue was recognised in the Income Statement in the period.\nSegmental information\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers, who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the executive Board of Directors.\nAll operations and information are reviewed together so that at present there is only one reportable operating segment.\nIn the opinion of the Directors, during the year the Group operated in the single business segment of the research and development of pharmaceutical products using technology developed by the Group.\nTaxation\nTaxation comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is based on taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable pro?t differs from net pro?t or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's current tax asset is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated in the statement of ?nancial position at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\nAsset class\nDepreciation method and rate\nComputer equipment\n33.33% straight line\nGoodwill and Intangible assets\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identi?able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is held in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing rate at each reporting year date.\nGoodwill is not amortised, but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (\"CGUs\") for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to bene?t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The Group currently has only one CGU.\nOther intangible assets, including customer relationships, licences, patents and trademarks, that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nAmortisation is provided on the Group's patents to write off the cost, less any estimated residual value, over their expected useful economic life on a 10% straight line basis.\nImpairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\nFor impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of a related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.\nCash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group's management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's (or cash-generating unit's) carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group's latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash-generating unit and reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and asset-specific risk factors.\nImpairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigni?cant risk of changes in value.\nFinancial instruments\nIFRS 9 requires an entity to address the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities.\ni)\nClassification\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n?\nthose to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\nThe Company classifies financial assets as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:\n?\nthe asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and\n?\nthe contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest.\nii) Recognition\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date (that is, the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset). Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\niii) Measurement\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\nTransaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\nDebt instruments\nAmortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\niv) Impairment\nThe Company assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with any debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group's financial liabilities include other payables.\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, and, where applicable, adjusted for transaction costs unless the Group designated a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss.\nSubsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, which are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss (other than derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedging instruments).\nAll interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument's fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included within finance costs or finance income.\nEquity\nEquity comprises the following:\n?\n\"Share capital\" represents the nominal value of equity shares.\n?\n\"Share premium\" represents the amount paid for equity shares over the nominal value.\n?\n\"Reverse acquisition reserve\" arises due to the elimination of the Company's investment in Nuformix Technologies Limited.\n?\n\"Merger relief reserve\" represents the share premium arising on issue of shares in respect of the reverse acquisition takeover.\n?\n\"Share option reserve\" represents the fair value of options issued.\n?\n\"Retained earnings\" represents retained earnings/losses.\nDe?ned contribution pension obligation\nA de?ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which ?xed contributions are paid into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold suf?cient assets to pay all employees the bene?ts relating to employee service in the current and prior years.\nFor de?ned contribution plans contributions are paid into publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory or contractual basis. The contributions are recognised as employee bene?t expense when they are due. If contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as an asset.\nShare based payments\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 17.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in pro?t or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.\nEquity\n?\nsettled share\n?\nbased payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.\nFor cash\n?\nsettled share\n?\nbased payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At each reporting date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in pro?t or loss for the year.\nEarnings per Ordinary Share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its Ordinary Shares.\nBasic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to Shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of Ordinary Shares for the effects of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares\nInvestment in subsidiaries\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried in the Company's balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries the difference between disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts of the investments are recognised in pro?t or loss.\n3.

Income Tax (cont.)\nFactors that may affect future tax charges\nSince 1 April 2017 there has been a single rate of corporation tax of 19% in place. From 1 April 2023, the main rate of corporation tax will rise to 25% for companies with profits over \u00a3250,000. For companies with profits of \u00a350,000 or less, they will pay corporation tax at the small profits rate of 19%. Where a company's profits fall between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3250,000, they will pay corporation tax at the main rate reduced by marginal relief. The upper and lower limits will be proportionally reduced for short accounting periods and where there are associated companies.\n9.

The calculations use cash flow projection based on financial budgets approved by the Directors covering a 30-year period with a discount rate of 20% assumed. The recoverable amount of the CGU based on the value-in-use calculation exceeded its carrying amount. The Directors also assessed the market capitalisation of the Group with reference to the share price of the Company and supported the view that goodwill is not impaired.\n12.\nTrade and other receivables\n30\nSep\n31 March\n2023\n\u00a3\n2022\n\u00a3\nPrepayments\n17,919\n27,941\nOther receivables\n48,938\n171,659\n66,857\n199,600\nThe fair value of trade and other receivables is considered by the Directors not to be materially different to the carrying amounts.\n13.\nCash and cash equivalents\n30 Sep\n31 March\n2023\n\u00a3\n2022\n\u00a3\nCash at bank\n202,548\n464,095\nThe Directors consider that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents represents their fair value.\n14.\nShare capital\nAllotted, called up and fully paid shares\n31\nSep\n2023\n31 March\n2022\nNo.\n\u00a3\nNo.\n\u00a3\nOrdinary shares of \u00a30.001 each\n744,309,368\n744,309\n615,609,368\n615,609\nNo.\nAs at 1 April 2022\n615,609,368\nPlacement of new shares on the stock market\n128,700,000\nAs at 30 September 2023\n744,309,368\nOn\n11 April 2022 and\n21 April 2023, the company completed capital increases through the issue of 128,700,000 shares of \u00a30.001 each in share placements, with an overall share premium of \u00a3160,285.\n15.
