A licence valid until 6 April 2025 has subsequently been granted to the Company to temporarily occupy the site for MOU-5 well operations.\nAn updated Independent Technical Report by Scorpion Geoscience Limited for the Jurassic MOU-5 structure gives net P50 upside Prospective Resources for gas of 5.916 TCF to the Company, with a conservative risking of 12% versus the Company's internal upside Chance of Success of 50%.\nThe MOU-5 drilling objectives remain as announced on 6 June 2024.\nOperational planning has now re-commenced, with the regulatory process concluded, to complete the MOU-5 drilling programme this year at the earliest opportunity.\nMOU-5 and MOU-4 well rigless testing to evaluate helium presence potential\nBackground to helium potential - MOU-3 gas sample\nThe gas sample analysed at 1395 metres MD KB in the Moulouya Fan in MOU-3, unlike any other shallower gas sample collected whilst drilling, showed evidence for the presence of helium. MOU-3 was drilled closed to significant faults extending down into basement rocks.\nThe Company will be undertaking a more detailed independent review of the potential for helium over the coming months, which will incorporate results from the MOU-4 rigless testing programme. Multispectral satellite spectroscopy analysis will also be undertaken over the Guercif licence area.\nBased on the available data, the Company has decided to include a test for helium in the MOU-4 rigless testing programme and for a potential testing programme for MOU-5 if the well results are positive for gas. Testing operations will be coordinated to take place immediately after drilling of the MOU-5 well, before the rig is demobilised to another location, in order to make cost-effective use of an on-site pressure-volume-temperature (\"PVT\"\") laboratory to provide more accurate screening for the presence of potential helium gas.\nPaul Griffiths, Executive Chairman of Predator, commented:\n\"\nWhilst MOU-5 is focussed on finding potential gas resources of a sufficient size to service the gas-to-power market in Morocco, the evaluation of the potential for helium presence would be an added value to the area development. Recent helium discoveries and newsflow is leading to a better understanding of how and where helium deposits might be generated. It is likely that this has been over-looked in the past where the focus has been on developing hydrocarbon potential in areas which potentially are also helium domains. We are cautious but excited regarding the potential for helium in Guercif. The Moulouya Fan and the carbonate reservoirs that may be encountered in MOU-5 have the ability to hold large volumes of gas and have effective seals.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Executive Chairman\nLonny Baumgardner Managing Director\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nNovum Securities Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOak Securities\nJerry Keen\nTel: +44 (0)207 399 9425\nTel: +44 (0)203 973 3678\nJerry.keen@oak-securities.com\nCamarco - Financial PR\nBilly Clegg / Owen Roberts / Fergus Young\nTel: +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nP\nredatorOilGas@camarco.co.uk\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a diversified portfolio of scaled assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure, with multiple fully financed upcoming catalysts.\nPredator has two high quality, scalable gas projects in Morocco with fast pace of commercialisation and blue sky potential.

We are already ahead of our production target for February 2026.\nTrinidad is part of a World Class oil and gas province that has recently assumed greater geopolitical strategic significance. The potential future re-entry of the oil majors to Venezuela could facilitate a return of larger service companies to Trinidad, thereby increasing competitiveness and access to in-country materials and services to lower drilling costs.\nOur decision to expand our footprint onshore Trinidad in 2025 has been fully justified and we look to further develop our strategic business opportunities in 2026.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nAlbR Capital Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nFlagstaff Strategic and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAlison Alfrey\nFergus Mellon\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\npredator@flagstaffcomms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a portfolio of assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure and production, appraisal and exploration projects onshore Trinidad.\nMorocco offers a potentially faster route to commercialisation of shallow biogenic gas through a CNG or micro-LNG development. The structure penetrated by the MOU-1 and MOU-3 wells is currently defined as having the best potential for an application for an Exploitation Concession in 2026. The Company is committed to partnering with entities capable of supporting a future development decision and who have already identified the opportunity as one warranting the execution of a Collaboration Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding. Moroccan gas prices are high, and the fiscal terms are some of the best in the world.\u00a0The presence of gas export infrastructure adjacent to the MOU-1 and MOU-3 structure allows for a scalable gas development after initial CNG or micro-LNG gas production over time establishes the extent of connected gas volumes and the capability of reservoirs to deliver at plateau rates over time.\nTrinidad offers the security of a mature onshore oil province that has been producing hydrocarbons for over 50 years. Predator has assembled a portfolio of onshore producing fields with opportunities for production enhancement and additional infill development and appraisal drilling. Significant legacy tax losses, economies of scale and the application of new low-cost technologies are factors that can improve profit margins per barrel of oil produced. A Master Services Agreement with local operator NABI Construction relieves the Company of the burden and costs of operating the fields and executing drilling and heavy well workovers. In return the Company receives 30% of gross sales revenues for which it can use its acquired tax losses to substantially reduce Petroleum Profit Tax from 50% to an effective rate of 12.5%.\nPredator has an experienced technical, financial and legal management team with particular knowledge of the Moroccan and Trinidad sub-surface and operations and an ability to complete M & A transactions in Trinidad and receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner and without any unnecessary advisory fees for transactions. The Company's strategy is to operate at a much reduced overhead compared to other operators with portfolios of assets of similar extent to maintain competitiveness.\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings plc is listed on the\nEquity Shares (transition) category of the Official List of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange's\u00a0main market for listed securities\n(symbol: PRD).\nFor further information, visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Pictures of the coiled tubing unit, new to Morocco, have been uploaded to the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nto provide context for the scale of the operation being undertaken by the Company.\nThe delay in customs clearance was\nbeyond management's control\n.\nFirst Extension Period\nRatification of Petroleum Agreement Amendment No. 4 which extended the Initial Period of the Guercif Petroleum Agreement and corresponding Exploration Permits to 61 months until 5 June, 2024 was announced on 1 May 2024.\nAn application to enter the First Extension Period was submitted as required 2 months before the expiry of the Initial Period on 5 June 2024.\nConfirmation of entering the First Extension Period requires obtaining the required statutory approvals under the form of an order executed by the Ministry of Energy approving the extension to the Exploration Permits into the First Extension Period.\nMOU-3 rigless testing programme unchanged\nThe Company's rigless testing operations commenced before 5 June 2024 with site preparations at MOU-3 with initial customs clearances received on 12 June 2024 to import the Sandjet testing tools and chemicals. Unfortunately it was beyond management's control that the programme would be subsequently impacted by the ratification required to approve entering the First Extension Period with a corresponding delay in receiving further customs clearances.\nThe Company took steps to manage the mobilisation logistics to ensure that no significant standby costs were incurred whilst waiting on regulatory documentation.\nAt all times the Company's primary concern was to maintain the ability to utilise the key rigless testing equipment and services within its available time slot for exclusive use by the Company. This we have successfully achieved.\nThe Company is introducing new rigless testing technology in the form of the Sandjet testing tools and the Baker Hughes coiled tubing unit. Positive results from MOU-3 could potentially transform rigless testing strategies and increase cost-effectiveness.\nThe MOU-3 testing programme remains as announced on 6 June 2024.\nA further operations update will follow once the MOU-3 rigless testing programme is completed.\nThe Company does not intend to provide an operations schedule for testing at present as plans remain flexible and may be modified depending on initial test results and operational efficiencies.\nThe Company thanks ONHYM for their ongoing support and partnership through the regulatory process which largely resulted from the Company's desire to keep the momentum of operations going in order to avail of limited availability of well services equipment in a competitive global market.\nPaul Griffiths, Executive Chairman of Predator, commented:\n\"\nIt goes without saying that the last 12 months following the achievement of the MOU-3 and MOU-4 drilling programmes has been immensely frustrating for Directors, Management and shareholders alike. Planning for rigless testing has been impacted by several amendments to the Initial Period of the Guercif Petroleum Agreement, whilst trying to balance access to limited well services and equipment caused by global competition. Ours is a big operation for Morocco but not by global standards. We have to be patient and creative.\nHowever, by entering the First Extension Period we can look forward to re-establishing our operational momentum and newsflow.\nOur near-term ability to supply CNG to the Moroccan industry is more advanced than other possible options. The Company is debt-free which allows it to have greater flexibility when considering different options, including M&A transactions and a partial divestment, for the modest levels of development finance required for \"First Gas\". This is why Afriquia Gaz remains heavily engaged with the Company and supportive of our efforts to get gas to market at the very earliest opportunity.\"\nFor further information visit\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\nFollow the Company on X @PredatorOilGas.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse.\nFor more information please visit the Company's website at\nwww.predatoroilandgas.com\n:\nEnquiries:\nPredator Oil & Gas Holdings Plc\nPaul Griffiths Executive Chairman\nLonny Baumgardner Managing Director\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 834 600\nInfo@predatoroilandgas.com\nNovum Securities Limited\nDavid Coffman / Jon Belliss\nOak Securities\nJerry Keen\nTel: +44 (0)207 399 9425\nTel: +44 (0)203 973 3678\nJerry.keen@oak-securities.com\nCamarco - Financial PR\nBilly Clegg / Owen Roberts / Fergus Young\nTel: +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nP\nredatorOilGas@camarco.co.uk\nNotes to Editors:\nPredator is an oil & gas company with a diversified portfolio of scaled assets including unique and highly prospective onshore Moroccan gas exposure, with multiple fully financed upcoming catalysts.\nPredator has two high quality, scalable gas projects in Morocco with fast pace of commercialisation and blue sky potential.
