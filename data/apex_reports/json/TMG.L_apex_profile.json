THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT ANY OFFER WILL BE MADE\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.\n6 June 2024\nThe MISSION Group plc\n(\"MISSION\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nRESPONSE TO REVISED POSSIBLE OFFER ANNOUNCEMENT BY BRAVE BISON GROUP PLC\nMISSION\nGroup plc\u00a0(AIM: TMG)\n, notes the announcement released on 3 June 2024 by Brave Bison Group plc (\"\nBrave Bison\n\") in accordance with Rule 2.4 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"\nCode\n\") and confirms, in line with the announcement it made on 4 June 2024, that on 25 May 2024, it received a further unsolicited conditional proposal regarding a possible offer by Brave Bison for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of\nMISSION\n. Such possible offer comprised an all-share offer at an exchange ratio of 13.9 Brave Bison shares for each ordinary share in\nMISSION,\na partial cash alternative of up to 50 per cent. of the potential offer price and the intention to undertake an underwritten share placing to reduce indebtedness of the proposed combined group (the \"\nRevised Possible Offer\n\").\nThe board of\nMISSION\n(\"\nBoard\n\") understands that the amount of such partial cash alternative and the quantum of any proposed reduction in indebtedness for the proposed combined group is not certain and will be determined by Brave Bison following a period of due diligence.\nBased on the terms of the Revised Possible Offer and the closing market prices of\nMISSION\nand Brave Bison shares on 10 May 2024, being the last trading day prior to Brave Bison's 12 May 2024 announcement of the initial possible offer, the Revised Possible Offer values each\nMISSION\nshare at approximately 35 pence1. Were the Revised Possible Offer to be implemented on its indicative terms, prior to any proposed equity fundraising, this would result in\nMISSION's\nshareholders holding approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group.\nOn 6 June 2024, the Board of\nMISSION\n,\nfollowing consultation with its financial advisers and a period of engagement with certain of its shareholders, unanimously rejected the Revised Possible Offer which it believes to be opportunistic and undervalues the Group and its prospects. Moreover, it is dilutive to\nMISSION's\nshareholders as it does not reflect the relevant contributions of each party to the proposed combined group.\nIn that regard, the Board of\nMISSION\nwould like to bring shareholders' attention to the following points:\n\u00b7\nThe Board continues to believe that the Revised Possible Offer does not fully reflect the inherent value in\nMISSION\nwhich, has been reflected in a 62.1 per cent. increase in the\nMISSION\nshare price to 10 May 20243.\n\u00b7\nMoreover, the Board believes that the Revised Possible Offer undervalues the contribution of\nMISSION\nto the proposed combined group. Based on the respective net revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted pre-tax profit contributions of\nMISSION\nand Brave Bison as set out in their respective results for their financial years ending 31 December 2023,\nMISSION\nwould contribute approximately 81 per cent. of revenues, approximately 71 per cent. of adjusted EBITDA and approximately 54 per cent. of adjusted pre-tax profits to the proposed combined group2. The proposed exchange ratio under the terms of the Revised Possible Offer and of\nMISSION's\nshareholders holding approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group does not reflect that contribution.\n\u00b7\nThe proposed holding by\nMISSION\nshareholders of approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group also only represents the position before any potential dilution from the proposed equity fundraising outlined by Brave Bison in its 3 June possible offer announcement. The Board of\nMISSION\nunderstands that, while subject to due diligence, the size of this fundraising is anticipated to be between \u00a310 - 15 million at a price of 2.53 pence per Brave Bison share. Brave Bison has indicated to\nMISSION\nthat the proceeds of the equity fundraising, together with Brave Bison's existing cash (approximately \u00a37 million at 31 December 2023), would be used to deleverage the proposed combined group and to satisfy a cash alternative of up to 17.5 pence per\nMISSION\nshare. Brave Bison's current assumption based on publicly available information is that a minimum of \u00a34 million and a maximum of \u00a310 million would be required to reduce indebtedness, therefore providing between \u00a310 million and \u00a316 million for a cash alternative. The effect of any such equity fundraising could therefore further dilute\nMISSION's\nshareholders' interest in the proposed combined group below the proposed approximately 50 per cent. holding\nto the extent that\nMISSION's\nshareholders did not or were not able to participate in such fundraising.\n\u00b7\nBrave Bison has indicated the proposed equity fundraising would be underwritten by Oliver and Theodore Green and certain Brave Bison shareholders.\n\u00b7\nBrave Bison's proposed Board composition under the terms of the Revised Possible Offer also currently envisage only two additional Non-Executive Directors and no executive directors from\nMISSION\njoining the board of the proposed combined group. In the Board's view this does not reflect the significant contribution of\nMISSION\nto the proposed combined group.\n\u00b7\nThe Board of\nMISSION\ncontinues to believe the Revised Possible Offer is not transformational for\nMISSION\nand its offering to its clients. The increased scale and some additional capabilities do not offset the dilutive impact to\nMISSION's\nshareholders of only holding approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group\nand potentially less following the proposed equity fundraising. The\nMISSION\ndirectors also believe that the Revised Possible Offer does not provide a step change in scale, nor any new offering or access to new markets. In addition, in the meetings between Brave Bison and\nMISSION\nmanagement, the\nMISSION\nmanagement does not believe that Brave Bison have set out a compelling future strategy for the proposed combined group.\n\u00b7\nNotwithstanding the proposed dilution referred to above, Brave Bison anticipates that\nMISSION's\nshareholders would enjoy more value from the combination based on a re-rating of the proposed combined group. There is no certainty of a re-rating. In addition, if Brave Bison's shares are re-rated, it is likely this will benefit Brave Bison shareholders more than\nMISSION\nshareholders. This is because the current exchange ratio does not reflect the contribution of the\nMISSION\nbusiness to the proposed combined group. Furthermore, following the proposed placing,\nMISSION\nshareholders may not continue to hold approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group.\n\u00b7\nAs previously announced on 17 January 2024, the Board of\nMISSION\nhas set out how it expects to realise value for\nMISSION's\nshareholders through its standalone strategy and execution of the Group's Value Restoration Plan, which is now well underway.\n\u00b7\nThe Board continues to work closely with NatWest, the Company's lender, and was pleased to announce a refinancing arrangement on 28 March 2024, which extended facilities through to 5 April 2026. This provides the flexibility the Company needs to deliver on its Value Restoration Plan and reduce its leverage.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, the Board of\nMISSION\ncontinues to review the Group's options to reduce its debt position, including the disposal of certain assets within its portfolio.\nMISSION\nis in active discussions on a number of these assets. The Board considers that an disposal of even some of the assets would have a material impact on deleveraging, based on the estimated proceeds. The Board of\nMISSION\nremains confident that during the remainder of the year, it will deliver on its plan to reduce leverage.\n\u00b7\nThe announcement by Brave Bison on 3 June 2024 in relation to the Revised Possible Offer stated that\nMISSION's\nnet debt was \u00a325.5 million as at 20 October 2023, \u00a325.2 million as at 31 December 2023 and \u00a326.8 million as at 30 April 2024. The Board of\nMISSION\nwishes to advise that the net debt balance stated by Brave Bison in this announcement in relation to 20 October 2023 excludes acquisition obligations, while the balances at 31 December 2023 and 30 April 2024 include acquisition obligations. The net debt as at 20 October 2023 (including acquisition obligations) was \u00a331.0 million, compared to \u00a325.2 million at 31 December 2023 and \u00a326.8 million as at 30 April 2024 on the same basis, representing a reduction of \u00a34.2 million.\nMISSION\nalso wishes to clarify that the Pathfindr \u00a31 million initial consideration was received in the financial year ended 31 December 2023.\n\u00b7\nThe Board of\nMISSION\nnotes that Tangent Marketing Services Limited (\"\nTangent\n\") is referenced in Brave Bison's annual report as a related party of Brave Bison as Oliver and Theodore Green are indirect shareholders of Tangent, and Tangent is co-located with Brave Bison in its London offices. It is unclear to\nMISSION\nwhether Tangent operates in a similar market segment to Brave Bison and/or\nMISSION\n, and/or what ongoing time commitments Brave Bison management have with Tangent.\nAs previously announced, the Board of\nMISSION\nis open to proposals that it believes would enhance shareholder value and deliver benefits to\nMISSION's\nshareholders. The Board of\nMISSION\ndoes not consider the terms of the Revised Possible Offer to meet those criteria.\nShareholders are urged to take no further action at this time.\nIn accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the Code, Brave Bison must, by no later than 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 9 June 2024, either announce a firm intention to make an offer for\nMISSION\nin accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code, or announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. The deadline can be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code.\nThis announcement has been made by\nMISSION\nwithout the agreement or approval of Brave Bison.\nThere can be no certainty either that an offer will be made.\nThe attention of shareholders is drawn to the disclosure requirements of Rule 8 of the Code, which are summarised below.\nFootnotes:\n1\nThe valuation of approximately 35.2 pence per\nMISSON\nshare for\nMISSION's\nshareholders in the proposed combined group, is based on (i) an exchange ratio of 13.9 Brave Bison shares for each ordinary share in\nMISSION\n, (ii) a Brave Bison closing mid-market share price of 2.525 pence (as at 10 May 2024, being the last trading day prior to Brave Bison's 12 May 2024 announcement of the possible offer), (iii) an issued share capital of\nMISSION\nbeing 92,238,119 shares and a fully diluted share capital of 92,498,311, and (iv) an issued share capital of Brave Bison being 1,288,147,280 shares.\n2 The contribution of\nMISSION\nto the proposed combined group is based on the following information:\nRevenue\n\u00a3 million\n%\nMISSION (see Note 2(a))\n86.3\n80.5\nBrave Bison (see Note 2(b))\n20.9\n19.5\nPro forma\n107.2\n100.0\nAdjusted EBITDA\nMISSION (see Note 2(a))\n10.6\n71.3\nBrave Bison (see Note 2(b))\n4.3\n28.7\nPro forma\n14.9\n100.0\nAdjusted profit before tax\nMISSION (see Note 2(a))\n4.2\n53.6\nBrave Bison (see Note 2(b))\n3.6\n46.4\nPro forma\n7.8\n100.0\n(a) for the year ended 31 December 2023,\nMISSION\nhad reported net revenue of \u00a386.3 million from continuing operations (turnover of \u00a3195.4 million less cost of sales of \u00a3109.1 million), headline EBITDA of \u00a310.6 million (headline operating profit (continuing operations) of \u00a36.5 million, depreciation of owned tangible assets of \u00a31.2 million, depreciation expense on right of use assets of \u00a32.6 million and amortisation of other intangible assets of \u00a30.4 million) and headline pre-tax profits of \u00a34.2 million (continuing operations). This financial information relating to the Company has been extracted or derived (without any adjustment) from the Company's final results for the year ended 31 December 2023;\n(b) for the year ended 31 December 2023, Brave Bison reported net revenue of \u00a320.9 million (turnover/billings of \u00a335.7 million less cost of sales of \u00a314.8 million), adjusted EBITDA of \u00a34.3 million and adjusted pre-tax profits of \u00a33.6 million. This financial information relating to Brave Bison has been extracted or derived (without any adjustment) from Brave Bison's final results for the year ended 31 December 2023.;\n3 The closing mid-market price for a\nMISSION\nshare on 23 October 2023 was 14.0 pence, and on 10 May 2024 was 22.7 pence.\n4 The statements regarding\nMISSION's\noutstanding debts (net of cash balances) and certain liabilities totalling approximately \u00a325.2 million as at 31 December 2023 and comprised of net debt of \u00a315.4 million, acquisition obligations of \u00a35.5 million and HMRC Time to Pay agreement of \u00a34.3 million have\nbeen extracted or derived (without any adjustment) from\nMISSION's\nfinal results for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n5 The statements regarding\nMISSION's\noutstanding debts (net of cash balances) and certain liabilities totalling approximately \u00a326.8 million as at 30 April 2024 and comprised of net bank debt of \u00a322.2 million, acquisition obligations of \u00a34.1 million and HMRC Time to Pay agreement of \u00a30.5 million have been extracted from\nMISSION's\nunaudited internal financial information.\n6 The statements regarding\nMISSION's\noutstanding debts (net of cash balances) and certain liabilities totalling approximately \u00a331.0 million as at 20 October 2023 and comprised of net bank debt of \u00a325.5 million, acquisition obligations of \u00a35.5 million and HMRC Time to Pay agreement of \u00a3Nil have been extracted from\nMISSION's\nunaudited internal financial information.\nENDS\nENQUIRIES:\nDavid Morgan, Non-Executive Chair\nJames Clifton, Chief Executive Officer\nGiles Lee, Chief Financial Officer\nThe\u00a0MISSION\u00a0Group plc\nVia Houston\nSimon Bridges / Julie Langley / Andrew Potts / Harry Rees\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Financial Adviser, Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n020 7523 8000\nKate Hoare / Alexander Clelland / India Spencer\nHOUSTON\n(Financial PR and Investor Relations)\n0204 529 0549\nCanaccord Genuity Limited, which is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA, is acting as financial adviser and corporate broker exclusively for\nMISSION\nand for no one else in connection with the Revised Possible Offer and will not regard any other person as its client in relation to the matters referred to in this announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than\nMISSION\nfor providing the protections afforded to clients of Canaccord Genuity Limited, nor for providing advice in relation to the Revised Possible Offer or any other matter referred to in this announcement.\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of\nMISSION\nis James Clifton.\nPublication of this announcement\nIn accordance with Rule 26.1 of the Code, a copy of this announcement will be available on the Company's website at\nhttps://www.themission.co.uk/\nby no later than 12 noon (London time) on the business day following the date of this announcement\n.\nThe content of the website referred to in this announcement is not incorporated into and does not form part of this announcement.\nDisclosure requirements of the Code\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure (as defined in the Code) following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.
