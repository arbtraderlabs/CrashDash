Volta's home member state for the purposes of the EU Transparency Directive is the Netherlands. As such, Volta is subject to regulation and supervision by the AFM, being the regulator for financial markets in the Netherlands.\nVolta's Investment objectives are to preserve its capital across the credit cycle and to provide a stable stream of income to its Shareholders through dividends that it expects to distribute on a quarterly basis. The Company currently seeks to achieve its investment objectives by pursuing exposure predominantly to CLOs and similar asset classes. A more diversified investment strategy across structured finance assets may be pursued opportunistically. The Company has appointed BNP Paribas Asset Management Europe, an investment management company with a division specialised in structured credit, for the investment management of all its assets.\nABOUT BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT EUROPE\nBNP AM is a company incorporated under the laws of France, having its registered office at 1 Boulevard Haussmann, 75009 Paris, France, registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number 319 378 832, and registered as a portfolio management company with the AMF under approval no.

This appears anomalous with 6.3% total shareholder return in 1Q\u201924, the annualised cashflows in excess of 20%, the consensus outlook, as well as the structured debt finance and all investment company averages (11% and 6%, respectively). In our view, any discount reflects investor concerns that either the current NAV is unrealistic or that it cannot be achieved in the future. In this note, we examine what may drive such concerns, concluding they are more sentiment- than reality-driven; as such, they may be less likely to be sustained.\nPlease click on the link below for the full report:\nhttps://hardmanandco.com/research/corporate-research/volta-discount-into-perspective/\nIf you are interested in meeting the company, you can register your interest by clicking on the above link\nTo contact us:\nHardman & Co\n9 Bonhill Street\nLondon\nEC2A 4DJ\nwww.hardmanandco.com\nFollow us on Twitter\n@HardmanandCo\nContact:\nMark Thomas\nmt@hardmanandco.com\nHardman & Co Research can still be accessed for free after MiFID II.
