This agreement specifies a\nprogressive minimum\nannual financial commitment for the partner to place US$4.0m of orders with Haydale over the duration of the five year deal. The size of the Chinese Silicon Carbide cutting tool market has been estimated at c. US$214 million by 2024 with a compound annual growth rate of 6.2 % (Source: Global Silicon Carbide Fibres Market Report 2021 - 2028, Market Insight Reports).\nUnder the terms of the agreement the Chinese tooling manufacturing company will be the exclusive distributor of Haydale's unique and high-quality silicon carbide tooling into the Chinese market. This partnership is set to enhance the availability and accessibility of these premium materials to a broader range of industries in China, including the aerospace, automotive, and industrial manufacturing sectors.\nImportantly, the agreement will also provide Haydale with exclusive access to their new partner's range of proprietary Carbide and Cermet products for the US and UK markets (although there is no minimum financial commitment set for this element) which, together with another agreement signed earlier this year with a China based Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) tooling manufacturer, will allow Haydale to provide a one stop shop offering to its customers across a wide range of tooling requirements.\nThis landmark deal for Haydale, valued at US$4.0 million over the five years, marks a major milestone in the Company's global expansion strategy, increasing their portfolio of tooling offerings, and promises to bolster the commercial scope and reach of its US-based tooling operation.\nHaydale's CEO, Keith Broadbent, commented:\n\"We are excited to sign this agreement with our Chinese partner to help to bring our innovative silicon carbide cutting tool materials to China and the Asia area. It represents a significant opportunity for us to expand our international footprint and to support the growth of our manufacturing operations in the United States. We look forward to a successful collaboration that will drive value for both companies and our customers.\n\"Haydale's silicon carbide cutting tool materials are renowned for their superior quality and performance, offering enhanced durability, efficiency, and precision for a wide range of applications. The Company's commitment to excellence has positioned it as a trusted supplier in the cutting tool materials market. This new distribution agreement is part of Haydale's strategic plan to increase its presence in key global markets and to leverage new opportunities for growth and development.\"\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nKeith Broadbent, CEO\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nMark Bolt, Sales & Marketing Manager\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley, Corporate FinanceAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotes to Editors\nHaydale is a global technologies group and service provider that facilitates the integration of graphene and other nanomaterials into the next generation of industrial materials and commercial technologies.

The award has been made in recognition of the continued support and contribution of staff during the Company's operational turnaround, including voluntary salary reductions, and is intended to retain and incentivise key personnel through this transitional phase.\nTerms of the New Options\nThe New Options granted under the 2020 EMI Scheme recognise the differing levels of voluntary salary reduction undertaken by management and staff during the Company's operational turnaround and are structured accordingly.\nNew Options granted to members of the senior management team (including Directors and Subsidiary Directors), who have continued to work full time but whose salary has been reduced as part of the Company's cost-saving measures, have an exercise price of 0.45 pence per Ordinary Share, representing the same price paid by investors in the recent fundraising completed on 27 June 2025 and a 22.4% discount to the mid-market closing price on the date of grant.\nNew Options granted to other employees, whose working hours and salary were reduced proportionally as part of the Company's cost-saving measures, have an exercise price of 0.58 pence per Ordinary Share, being the mid-market closing price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the date of grant.\nAll New Options will vest and become exercisable on\n30 June 2026\n, provided the relevant participant remains in continuous employment with the Company or any member of the Group (and has not served notice of resignation) as at that date. No other vesting criteria, performance hurdles, or accelerated vesting provisions apply.\nDetails of resultant holdings\nFollowing the New Options grant, details of Options held by Directors, PDMRs and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, are as follows:\nDirector's name\nand employing Group company\nNumber of New Options granted\nAggregate number of options\npost grant\nCurrent total beneficial holding of Ordinary Shares\nCurrent holding as a % of Issued share capital\nSimon Turek*\n(Haydale Graphene Industries Plc)\n4,444,426\n4,444,426\n343,450,215\n7.94%\nPatrick Carter\n(Haydale Graphene Industries Plc)\n6,444,426\n36,444,426\n1,000,000\n0.05%\nDavid Davies\n(Haydale Ltd)\n4,368,000\n14,368,000\n50,671\n0.00%\nMark Heycock\n(Haydale Ltd)\n3,555,573\n13,555,573\n-\n-\nJohn-Mark Seymour\n(Haydale Ltd)\n3,200,000\n13,200,000\n-\n-\nOther Employees\n14,\n427\n,143\n34,\n177\n,143\nn/a\nn/a\nTotal:\n36,439,568\n116,189,568\n344,500,886\n7.99%\n*including Mr Turek's 49% indirect interest in Quidos Technologies Limited\nFollowing the New Options grant, the Company's total number of Options under the 2020 EMI Scheme outstanding as at the date of this announcement is\n116,189,568\nrepresenting approximately\n2.69\n% of the Company's existing issued share\ncapital and 2.71% on a\nfully diluted basis including all outstanding warrants.\nThe number of Ordinary Shares currently in issue is\n4,322,955,947\nand it is this number that has been used to calculate the above percentage shareholdings.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nGareth Kaminski-Cook, Non-Executive Chair\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley/Trisyia Jamaludin, Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them.\nNotification of a Transaction pursuant to Article 19(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na.\nName\n1.
