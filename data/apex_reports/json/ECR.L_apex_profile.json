As we look forward to an exciting period for ECR, we will provide regular updates on our progress.\"\nMr. Gibbs' appointment to the Board is subject to approval from the Company's Nominated Adviser after the customary director due diligence process to satisfy itself as to Board composition and independence and the suitability of a potential director for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers.

With initial gold production at Raglan expected this month and development underway at Blue Mountain, the Board considers that ECR is now positioned to transition into a multi-project gold producer and explorer.\nThe Directors intend that the majority of the net proceeds of the Fundraising will be used to advance ECR's projects in Queensland and Victoria, specifically:\n\u00b7\nFinalising preparations to bring the Blue Mountain gold project in Queensland, Australia (the \"Blue Mountain Project\") into production to generate revenue for the Company, including securing all necessary equipment for production (noting that ECR expects some sharing of resources, and therefore economies of operation, between its Blue Mountain Project and the Raglan alluvial gold project in Queensland (the \"Raglan Project\")\n\u00b7\nTargeted exploration at the Lolworth Project, North Queensland, Australia (the \"Lolworth Project\")\nwhere last year's maiden drilling campaign produced notable shallow intercepts of gold and silver. At a 900 km2 project area, the Lolworth Project is considered by the Board to represent a potentially significant multi-metal opportunity for ECR\n\u00b7\nDeveloping the Company's partnership with the Geological Survey of Queensland and James Cook University to further investigate the critical minerals potential at the Lolworth Project\n\u00b7\nAdvancing ECR's projects in Victoria, primarily at the Bailieston Project area (the \"Bailieston Project\"), where previous drilling has indicated the presence of gold at shallow depth and potentially high grade antimony\nThe Directors also intend to apply the net proceeds of the Fundraising towards ECR's corporate and working capital purposes. Following completion of the Fundraising, and taking account of its forthcoming production plans at the Raglan and Blue Mountain Projects, the Board believes that ECR should be funded for all currently planned activities until very significantly beyond the end of 2026.\nIn the medium to longer term, the Directors believe that the cashflow potential from gold production from the Raglan Project, once that project is fully operational, has the potential to cover all of the Company's overheads and bringing Blue Mountain into production has the potential to support ECR's currently contemplated future exploration and development operations.\nDetails of the Fundraising\nThe Company has conditionally raised \u00a31.5 million (before expenses) through the Fundraising for a total of\n576,923,068\nnew Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price. The new Ordinary Shares will be issued on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authorities granted to the Board at the Company's annual general meeting held on 23 April 2025.\nThe new Ordinary Shares, when issued and fully paid, will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares in issue and therefore will rank equally for all dividends or other distributions declared, made or paid after the issue of the new Ordinary Shares.\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 22 per cent. to the closing middle market price of 0.335 pence per Ordinary Share on 7 January 2026, being the latest business day prior to the announcement of the Fundraising.\nOAK Securities (\"OAK Securities\") acted as the Company's broker in connection with the Fundraising.\nJoint Broker Appointment and Broker Warrants\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that OAK Securities has been appointed as a Joint Broker to the Company with immediate effect. OAK Securities has agreed that its fees for the first year of its appointment as Joint Broker will be payable by the Company in\n23,076,923\nnew Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price, which are to be issued upon Admission (as defined below).\nIn connection with the Fundraising, the Company will issue, on completion of the Fundraise,\n42,307,692\nwarrants to OAK Securities (the \"Broker Warrants\"). Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one new Ordinary Share exercisable at the Issue Price. OAK Securities has agreed that the Broker Warrants will not be exercised for at least six months. Thereafter the Broker Warrants are exercisable at any time until the third year anniversary of Admission. The Broker Warrants will not be tradeable, transferable nor CREST-enabled.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nAn application will be made to London Stock Exchange plc (\"London Stock Exchange\") for the 599,999,991 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\") and it is currently anticipated that Admission will become effective, and that dealings in the new Ordinary Shares will commence on AIM, at 8.00 a.m. on or around 15 January 2026. Completion of the Fundraising is conditional on Admission.\nUpon Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will consist of 3,290,888,016 Ordinary Shares with one voting right each.

This support reflects confidence in both our strategy and our progress as we establish ECR as a multi-site gold company.\n\"Our immediate focus is on near-term production. At the Raglan Project, with an operating team now secured, the Board expects initial gold this month. The Blue Mountain Project, which represents a significantly larger opportunity, continues to validate its commercial potential following last year's drilling and wash-plant work, and we are advancing our preparations for development.\n\"At the same time, we remain committed to unlocking the considerable exploration upside across our broader portfolio - including at the Lolworth Project, which we consider has significant multi-metal potential, and our Victorian projects where our work to date indicates shallow gold and high-grade antimony mineralisation offering further opportunities.\n\"With this Fundraising, our strong project pipeline and A$76 million of tax losses available to offset future production profits, we consider that ECR is now well-capitalised and positioned to develop into a significant mining and exploration company in 2026 and beyond.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nOAK Securities\nTel: +44 (0) 203 973 3678\nJoint Broker\nJerry Keen / Robert Bell\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and\nRaglan Resources Pty Ltd (\"Raglan Resources\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

Recently acquired by ECR Minerals, the Raglan Project includes a near-new 60 tonne-per-hour wash plant, a fully equipped gold room, established water supply, accommodation camp, mobile mining fleet and complete site infrastructure, providing a true turnkey mining solution. Positioned within an established gold-producing district, the Raglan Project potentially offers a low-capex, rapid pathway to production. The Raglan Project is also strategically located close to ECR's Blue Mountain alluvial project, enabling potential operational synergies across the Company's growing Queensland hub.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"Securing our operating team is the final major step to bring the Raglan Project into production, and I am thrilled that we can now set a clear expectation of initial gold production before the end of January 2026. This is a pivotal moment in ECR's journey. The Raglan Project gives us a low-capex, near-term route into gold production, and the revenues which we ultimately anticipate should be able to support the development of our broader Queensland portfolio - most notably the much larger Blue Mountain project.\n\"Momentum across the Company has been pleasing in recent months, from strong maiden drill results at the Lolworth project confirming a gold-silver system, to completing the acquisition of the Raglan Project. With\ncurrent gold prices sitting at historically high levels, the Raglan Project has the potential to be a profitable project\n, generating meaningful cashflow in due course that can be reinvested across the business.\n\"We entered 2026 with confidence and a clear operational plan.

          "content": "7 Aug 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 2948U\nECR Minerals PLC\n07 August 2025\n7 August 2025\nECR MINERALS PLC\n(\"ECR Minerals\", \"ECR\" or the \"Company\")\nAdoption of Bitcoin and Digital Asset Treasury Management Policy\nECR Minerals plc (LON: ECR), the exploration and development company focused on gold in Australia, is pleased to announce that its board of directors (the \"\nBoard\n\" or the \"\nDirectors\n\") have adopted a Bitcoin (\"\nBTC\n\") and Digital Asset Treasury Management Policy (the \"\nPolicy\n\").\nThe adoption of the Policy reflects\nECR's evolving long-term financial strategy, given ECR's ambition to work towards a potential revenue-generating phase, particularly at its Blue Mountain gold project in Queensland (the \"\nBlue Mountain Project\n\"). As noted in the Company's announcement on 8 October 2024, the Board considers that the Blue Mountain Project may be a viable commercial gold resource.\nUsing the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, ECR Digital Limited (\"\nECR Digital\n\"), ECR will hold a portion of its treasury reserves in digital assets, such as BTC or select high tier alternative digital coins, as either a partial hedge against fluctuations in gold prices or as a standalone store of value, which the Board views as effectively functioning as a modern form of digital inventory.\nFurthermore, as a UK headquartered company with Australian-based operations, the Board views currency management a core part of the Company's financial planning. In this regard, the Board believes that digital assets such as Bitcoin provides flexibility as a cross-border transactional currency.\nKey terms of the Policy:\n\u00b7\nUse of BTC for treasury management purposes:\nThe Board intends to invest no more than 50 per cent. of its free cash flows from gold production\n1\nto acquire BTC as a long-term treasury reserve. The Policy also provides that no more than 50 per cent. of surplus cash\n2\nheld by the Company may be used for BTC purchases. No speculative or leveraged trading of BTC or other digital assets is permitted, and the Company will not engage in derivatives or leveraged products that deviate from the goal of long-term asset holding.\n\u00b7\nCustody and security:\nThe Company will appoint a regulated custodian which is either registered by the Financial Conduct Authority (the \"\nFCA\n\") or regulated in its country of operation and the Policy prescribes a series of security protocols including mandatory storage in multi-signature wallets requiring at least two Board-approved signatories and the use of offline cold storage to minimise cyber risks.\n\u00b7\nApproved investment instruments:\nThe only approved instrument, investment or asset which the Company may hold, other than cash, is BTC. However, the Policy does give the Board discretion to select a list of high tier alternative digital assets which may comprise up to 15 per cent. of its available 50 per cent. treasury allocation headroom provided that such assets are capable of generating a yield (for example, Ethereum). Any yield generated must then be utilised to acquire additional BTC or other Board approved high tier alternative digital assets taking into account the Company's available 50 per cent. treasury allocation headroom.\n\u00b7\nSupervision, responsibilities and control framework:\nThe Company will appoint a treasury committee, comprising at least one non-executive director, the financial controller and the chairman, who will be responsible for administering and reviewing adherence to the Policy on a quarterly basis.\nThe full Policy is available on the Company's investor relations website at:\nhttps://ecrminerals.com/investors/aim-rule-26/\n.\nRisks associated with the Policy:\nWhile the Board recognises that the acquisition of digital assets, including BTC, may provide benefits (as outlined above), it also acknowledges the inherent risks associated with such assets. Digital assets, including BTC, are highly volatile as well as speculative in nature and are subject to significant price fluctuations. In addition, it should be noted that a growing number of publicly traded companies have adopted digital asset focused treasury strategies, and this has sometimes resulted in significant volatility in their share price and a dislocation between their market capitalisation and the underlying value of their assets. Consequently, exposure to digital assets such as BTC may, in turn, amongst other matters, compound and increase the volatility of the Company's share price.\nTo mitigate these risks, the Company intends to allocate no more than 50 per cent. of its free cash flow from gold production operations1 and surplus cash2 held by the Company towards principally the acquisition and holding of BTC, the most liquid digital asset, into treasury.\nThe Board also acknowledges that the regulatory environment for digital assets remains uncertain and subject to change. This may impact the Company's ability to hold or transact in digital assets, including BTC. There are also risks associated with custody, security, and the accounting treatment of digital assets, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and investor returns.\nThe Company confirms that the implementation of the Policy does not alter its status under UK financial services law, including the Alterative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013. The Policy is a treasury management initiative only and does not constitute a collective investment undertaking or alternative investment fund. Similarly, the Policy represents a financial strategy decision and does not alter, the Company's core business operations as an exploration and development company focused on gold in Australia. The adoption of the Policy is not intended to result in the Company becoming or being seen as an investing company.\nNick Tulloch, ECR's Chairman, said:\n\"Attitudes towards money and financial systems are changing and the increased awareness of digital assets in recent years has made them a growing, and in some cases preferred, payment mechanism. ECR is poised to enter a new phase of its development when its projects potentially move into commercial production. As we announced on 4 August 2025, our Blue Mountain Project in particular has the potential not only to make a significant revenue contribution to ECR but also to generate positive operating cashflow for deployment to our proposed bitcoin and digital asset treasury. It is incumbent on ECR to have in place a robust cash management strategy ahead of that potential commercial production and it is equally apparent that a multi-national, and therefore multi-currency, business such as ours will benefit from an active currency management solution.\n\"We have begun working with experts in this field to implement the Policy. In particular, we have identified several experienced individuals, and we are expecting to make an advisory appointment shortly.\n\"We have a great deal to look forward to in the coming months and I will look forward to updating shareholders further in due course.\"\n1\nafter operating costs, capital expenditure and short-term working capital requirements; and\n2\ntaking into account forthcoming capital expenditure and operating costs as well as a benchmark of maintaining 12 months' of working capital.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser\nNick Naylor / Alex Brearley / Vivek Bhardwaj\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nBroker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nBroker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company.
