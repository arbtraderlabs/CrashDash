Holdings PLC\n09 September 2024\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nPassive Fire Protection\nDivision Update\nRecent contract wins\nPFP division quoted pipeline now in excess of \u00a37m\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), comprising three divisions: Controlled Environment Agriculture (\"CEA\"); Contract Electronics Manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and Passive Fire Protection (\"PFP\"), announces two new contracts in its PFP division with construction companies in London and Liverpool, together worth c. \u00a3145,000.\nThe Liverpool based contract is for a research facility and is valued at c. \u00a3120,000, with revenues expected to be fully recognised within this financial year. As with other clients within the PFP division, there is scope to generate additional revenues from this customer's portfolio of sites throughout the UK.\nThe Company has also recently completed another PFP project at an office block in the Strand, London, worth c. \u00a325,000. The division is currently working on projects in Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool, and the PFP division has a current quoted pipeline worth in excess of \u00a37 million.\nThe PFP division is focussed on strengthening relationships with its customers, who typically are responsible for portfolios of properties requiring remedial work in respect of fire safety. With the recently expanded capacity, the Company also continues to target new projects with new clients across the UK.\nFurthermore, demand for remedial passive fire protection solutions is being driven by the Fire Safety Act 2021 and Building Safety Act 2022. Given the ongoing UK Government focus on developers, building owners, housing associations etc., undertaking remediation works continues to underpin the market, with\nover 5,000 high risk buildings nationwide over 18 metres high and a further 35,000 buildings between 11 and 18 metres* requiring urgent attention.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"We continue to see strong demand within the PFP division. Our cost effective and non-invasive retrospective installation of cavity fire barriers will help meet Government targets in bringing buildings up to the required fire safety standards, giving building owners and their occupants peace of mind. Recent installations into office blocks, student accommodation and now the research facility in Liverpool have ranged significantly in sizes (\nbetween 6 and 18 metres plus in height\n), highlighting the flexibility of our solutions as we focus on tackling the significant need to ensure fire security measures are met\n.\n\"With 1,300 buildings in London alone needing priority remedial fire safety work**, we have an excellent opportunity to establish ourselves, and Injectaclad, as the preferred answer.\n\"As with everyone in this industry, the Company followed the findings of the Grenfell Report closely and would embrace any proposed regulatory changes. We look forward to the Government's response in due course and will fully support any legislation that is implemented.\"\n*\nEstimators price cladding replacement at 10 times government budget (theconstructionindex.co.uk)\n**\nLondon Fire Brigade calls for refit of all high-rise buildings - BBC News\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nvia Walbrook PR\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Harris / Rob Patrick\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital (Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\nTel: +44 (0) 203 179 5300\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: controlled environment agriculture (\"CEA\"); contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and passive fire protection (\"PFP\").

This system is retroactively installed within building cavities, reinstating fire-resistant performance and containing the spread of fire and smoke compliant with regulatory requirements. This innovative solution stands out as an appealing alternative to the more costly and disruptive method of removing external facades and installing traditional fire barriers. With a proven track record in the passive fire protection market and a robust sales pipeline, LSTH IFB targets a UK market potentially valued at up to \u00a350 billion*.\n*\nEstimators price cladding replacement at 10 times government budget (theconstructionindex.co.uk)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
