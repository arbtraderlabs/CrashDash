(\"InEnTec\") to deploy InEnTec's proven PEM\u00ae Melter gasification technology across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (\"License Agreement\").\nStrategic Pivot and Accelerated Execution\nFollowing the path announced in June, HUI has pivoted decisively from a pre-commercial, small-scale technology to a full-size size proven system. It is anticipated that securing this License Agreement, will put the Company in a stronger position to execute its strategy to scale InEnTec PEM\u00ae Melter systems across KSA and the Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\"), moving away from small or pilot-scale initiatives and concentrating on large industrial-scale infrastructure that directly supports regional decarbonisation, particularly in the steel and cement sectors.\nExclusive, Operational Licence Secured Across the MENA Region\nThe License Agreement grants HUI exclusive operational use of InEnTec's proven PEM\u00ae Melter gasification technology in the MENA region, with exclusivity for ten years, subject to compliance with the License Agreement's ongoing financial and other obligations.\nThe Licence Agreement positions HUI as the sole company authorised to build, operate, and scale PEM\u00ae Melter systems across MENA. HUI expects the License Agreement to help it originate, partner with third parties and deliver large-scale, industrial infrastructure projects across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (\"KSA\") and the wider GCC. The Board envisages that HUI's deployment of InEnTec technology will transform waste destruction and decarbonisation, converting non-recyclable plastics, hazardous waste, medical waste, and indestructible PFAS/PEFs into clean hydrogen, carbon-free fuels, and new materials at an industrial scale.\nStrategic Alliance and InEnTec Support\nInEnTec's willingness to license its world-leading PEM\u00ae Melter technology for the MENA region exclusively to HUI reflects a strong endorsement of HUI's capabilities and strategic vision and HUI would like to express its sincere appreciation to InEnTec for their trust and collaboration.\nThis partnership establishes a long-term strategic alliance in the region, positioning HUI to potentially rapidly deploy transformational waste-to-hydrogen infrastructure, address hazardous and indestructible waste streams, and capture waste to hydrogen opportunities in the MENA region. The Board believes that the support of InEnTec will provide HUI with credibility, and accelerated access to strategic partners and funders, reinforcing the Company's ability to convert demand into contracted projects that deliver measurable environmental, industrial, and commercial impact.\nWorld-Class Technology Aligned with Regional Ambition\nInEnTec's PEM\u00ae Melter technology converts non-recyclable plastic, hazardous and medical waste, and PFAS/PEFs into clean hydrogen and other valuable carbon-free products at an industrial scale. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, under the visionary leadership of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and driven by his Vision 2030, provides a uniquely ambitious environment for rapid deployment.\nWith assistance from the Research, Development and Innovation Authority (RDIA), the Saudi Investment Recycling Company (SIRC), alongside support from other Saudi institutions, HUI has moved from a tech concept to a tangible operating technology capable of supporting projects subject to, among others, funding being obtained, of a scale that represent multibillion-dollar infrastructure investment. Such a deployment would directly address environmental hazards while producing hydrogen to decarbonise heavy industry, creating measurable climate and industrial impact,\nThe Board believes that endorsement at the Kingdom level, together with the backing of RDIA and SIRC, will open access to strategic partners, industrial off takers, funders, and institutional capital. The policy clarity, ambition, and scale provided by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman materially strengthen the commercial case for rapid deployment and underpins confidence in the long-term value of HUI's Licence Agreement.\nCommercial Terms and Strategic Flexibility\nThe Licence Agreement was secured following an initial payment of USD 100,000 made in July and a further payment of USD 400,000 at the time of the grant of the License under the License Agreement. HUI holds an exclusive operational licence for a term of 10 years, subject to compliance with the Licence Agreement's ongoing financial and other obligations. While HUI holds exclusive rights across MENA, the Company also retains non-exclusive rights to pursue projects globally, providing flexibility to expand where demand exists.\nExecution Model and Value Creation\nIt is anticipated that HUI will act as an originating partner and co-developer alongside regional developers, engineering contractors, and strategic partners. HUI expects that projects will be financed by external institutional capital and regional funders, enabling HUI to scale without deploying significant capital from its own balance sheet.\nAs exclusive licence holder and project partner, HUI expects to participate in licence revenues, development fees, partner equity stakes, and long-term offtake-linked income streams, ensuring exposure to the upside of multibillion-dollar developments as projects progress from contract to construction and operation.\nJeff Surma, CEO of InEnTec, commented:\n\"InEnTec is proud to partner with HUI's accomplished business development team to advance a business plan poised to transform hydrogen generation across the MENA region. HUI has consistently demonstrated exceptional capability in market development, and we are excited to formalize this strategic licensing relationship. Together, we have the opportunity to drive decarbonization while tackling the region's growing waste challenges-an effort that aligns seamlessly with InEnTec's mission to deliver sustainable, innovative solutions.\"\nAleksandra Binkowska, CEO of Hydrogen Utopia International PLC, commented:\n\"\nWe have moved decisively from the jaws of mediocrity and small-scale projects to a position where we can actively reshape the decarbonisation landscape of the rapidly expanding steel and cement industries. With a license for InEnTec's proven technology now secured, HUI is positioned to be a major player in those parts of the world that are ambitious, scaling at pace and, crucially, determined and equipped to decarbonise their growing industrial base while simultaneously destroying non-recyclable plastics, hazardous and medical waste, and indestructible PFAS/PEFs\n.\"\nIman Ramani, commented:\n\"\nSecuring InEnTec's technology for the region is a defining milestone for Hydrogen Utopia. It gives us long-term certainty, strategic exclusivity, and the ability to follow through on our work with our government and industry partners, such as RDIA and SIRC. We will be deploying proven waste-to-hydrogen solutions at scale across Saudi Arabia and the GCC and are in a crucial stage of deployment in the Kingdom. This will accelerate our ambitions. I would like to thank InEnTec for the trust and the unwavering support of the RDIA on bringing this project to fruition\n.\"\nFor further information,\u202fplease contact:\nHydrogen Utopia International PLC\nAleksandra Binkowska\n+44 7795235181\nAlfred Henry Corporate Finance (Corporate Advisor)\nNick Michaels/Maya Klein Wassink\n+44 (0) 20 8064 4056\nCapital Plus Partners Limited (Broker)\nDominic Berger\n+44 (0)207 432 0505\nNovum Securities Limited (Broker)\nJon Belliss/Colin Rowbury\n+44 20 7399 9400\nAbout Hydrogen Utopia International PLC\nHUI aims to become one of the leading new European companies specialising in converting non-recyclable mixed waste plastic into hydrogen and other carbon-free fuels, new materials or distributed renewable heat.\nA HUI facility uses non-recyclable mixed waste plastic as feedstock and turns it into syngas from which new products and energy can be produced.

In addition, the investor will receive 13,333,334 warrants priced at 3p, issued at a ratio of one warrant for every two placing shares. Each warrant can be exercised for one share and will remain valid for 24-month from the date of issue.\nProceeds will accelerate the Company's growth in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) where HUI has already received a MISA (Ministry of Investment Saudi Arabia) licence and support from SIRC (Saudi Investment Recycling Company) and RDIA (Research, Development and Innovation Authority) and other key GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) markets. Further, it will also support the commercial deployment of the Inentec 'PEM' melter commercial waste-to-hydrogen technologies and advance HUI's role in the global transition to clean energy.\nApplication has been made for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on or around 15 December 2025 (\"Admission\") and the Placing Shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares of\nthe Company in issue.\nOn Admission the Company will have\n432,635,273\nordinary shares in issue, each ordinary share with one voting right. This number should be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculation by which shareholders will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in the Company.\nAleksandra Binkowska, CEO of Hydrogen Utopia International PLC, commented:\n\"This is a transformative milestone for HUI. We are delighted to welcome a strategic institutional investor whose confidence will enable rapid scaling in leading hydrogen markets.

InEnTec's highly advanced technology in advancing low-carbon energy, circular economy systems, and innovative industrial solutions makes a meaningful contribution to the Kingdom's long-term circular economy priorities and ambitions.\nRDIA is one of Saudi Arabia's most important national institutions, tasked with shaping and advancing the Kingdom's long-term research, development and innovation strategy. It plays a pivotal role in transitioning the Saudi economy toward one driven by knowledge, technology and high-value industrial capability. Through its mandate, RDIA supports the localisation of frontier technologies, the development of intellectual property, the expansion of local content, and the creation of high-tech economic sectors aligned with Vision 2030.\nA core element of this mission is RDIA's commitment to elevating the role of startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as engines of innovation. By integrating global technologies into Saudi Arabia's research and industrial ecosystem, RDIA aims to accelerate economic diversification, strengthen national competitiveness and drive social and economic development across the Kingdom.\nThis recognition marks a significant step in the company's efforts to establish a presence within Saudi Arabia's rapidly growing innovation landscape. It is a powerful, national credibility and validation signal that increases trust with local partners and allows Hydrogen Utopia International access to all of the Kingdom's Ministries, investors and giga-projects, accelerating HUI's ability to secure projects, investment and partnerships, with smoother government engagement and permitting, access to grants, funding schemes and national innovation programmes.\nHydrogen Utopia International believes that RDIA's mission and national importance make this emerging cooperation particularly significant. Alignment with RDIA's priorities places HUI's and InEnTec technology within Saudi Arabia's highest-level strategic framework for research, innovation and technological advancement.\nHydrogen Utopia International PLC will continue to update shareholders as further progress is made.\nAleksandra Binkowsa, CEO of Hydrogen Utopia International PLC, commented\n:\n\"We are honoured to receive such recognition from the Research, Development and Innovation Authority, an institution whose strategic vision is driving the Kingdom's research and industrial ambitions. Our exclusive option to represent InEnTec's plasma-assisted waste-to-hydrogen technology across MENA, with a particular focus on Saudi Arabia and the GCC, positions HUI to contribute meaningfully to low-carbon energy solutions and circular-economy initiatives. We look forward to working closely with RDIA and other key stakeholders to advance innovation, deliver sustainable industrial solutions, and strengthen Saudi Arabia's leadership in cutting-edge technology sectors.\"\nIman Ramani:\n\"Receiving recognition from RDIA is a significant milestone for Hydrogen Utopia's entry into the Kingdom. It reflects the strength of our technology and validates the work we have done to align our vision with Saudi Arabia's national innovation agenda. I am proud to have led this engagement to support bringing world-class waste-to-hydrogen solutions to a country that is redefining the global clean-energy landscape.\"\nFor further information,\u202fplease contact:\nHydrogen Utopia International PLC\nAleksandra Binkowska\n+44 7795235181\nAlfred Henry Corporate Finance Limited (LSE Corporate Adviser)\nNick Michaels/Maya Klein Wassink\n+44 20\n8064 4056\nNovum Securities Limited (Broker)\nJon Belliss/Colin Rowbury\n+44 20 7399 9400\n\u200bCapital Plus Partners Limited (Broker)\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\u200bDominic Berger \u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\u200b+44 7799888544\u200b\u200b\nAbout Hydrogen Utopia International PLC\nHUI aims to become one of the leading new European companies specialising in converting non-recyclable mixed waste plastic into\nhydrogen and other\ncarbon-free fuels, new materials or distributed renewable heat.\nA HUI facility uses non-recyclable mixed waste plastic as feedstock and turns it into syngas from which new products and energy can be produced.
