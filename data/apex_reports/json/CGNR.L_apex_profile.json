Tyrone\nand three new gold deposits at the Grey Fox Project in\nCanada\n.\nFUNDRAISING SUMMARY\nThe\nIssue Price\nrepresents a discount of circa 27 per cent. to the closing mid-market price of\n6.5 pence\non\n8 October 2024\n, being the last practicable date prior to this announcement.\nEach Placing Share, Subscription Share and\nFee Share\nwill carry one non-transferable Warrant.\nAt the time of warrant exercise, if the warrant holder can prove they hold an amount of Ordinary Shares equal to the number of Ordinary Shares acquired as part of the Fundraising, the warrant rights will entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one new Ordinary Share at a price of 9.5p for every warrant held. Should the warrant holder not be able to prove ownership of such an amount of Ordinary Shares then, on exercise, the warrant rights will only entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one new Ordinary Share at the price of 9.5p for every two warrants held (e.g. a half a warrant).\nPayment must be received by the Company within 10 Business Days of the date the Warrants are exercised.\nThe warrants will be exercisable for a period of 12 months from the admission to trading on AIM of the Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Fee Shares\n(\u201c\nAdmission\n\u201d), creating 7,255,482 warrants (the \u201c\nFundraising Warrants\n\u201d).\nThe Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Fee Shares will represent approximately 13.17 per cent. of the enlarged issued share capital on Admission and have been issued to a combination of mainly new investors and certain existing shareholders.\nMr\nPhilip Hannigan\n(a substantial shareholder in the Company as defined in the AIM Rules for Companies) is participating in the Fundraising. Mr\nPhilip Hannigan\nis subscribing for 1,000,000 Subscription Shares and, as a consequence, is expected to hold 10,058,445 Ordinary Shares representing 18.25 per cent. of the enlarged share capital of the Company on Admission.\nThe Fundraising has been conducted within the Company\u2019s existing share authorities and is conditional on Admission becoming effective. Accordingly, the issue of the Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Fee Shares and the possible issue of new Ordinary Shares from the exercise of the Fundraising Warrants will be undertaken pursuant to the Company\u2019s existing share authorities.\nDIRECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE FUNDRAISING\nDetails of the\nparticipation\nby Professor\nRichard Conroy\nin the Fundraising at the Issue Price and the resultant shareholding immediately following Admission are as follows:\nName\nSubscription Shares being subscribed\nValue of the subscription at the Issue Price\nOrdinary Shares held following completion of the Fundraising\nPercentage of enlarged issued share capital\nProfessor Richard Conroy (Chairman)\n1,052,632\n\u00a350,000\n4,246,668\n7.71%\nIn addition, Professor\nRichard Conroy\nhave both been issued with 1,052,632 Fundraising Warrants at a price of\n9.5 pence\nper Ordinary Share exercisable for a period of 12 months from Admission.\nADMISSION, WARRANTS AND TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS\nAn application will be made shortly to the London Stock Exchange for Admission of the Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and the Fee Shares. It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Fee Shares on AIM will commence on or around\n15 October 2024\n.\nThe Fundraising Warrants will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other stock market and will not be transferable.

The samples returned very high gold grades of 21.9 g/t Au and 11.2 g/t Au and results for antimony were above detection limits greater than 1% (10,000 ppb).\nThe samples are with ALS Laboratory for detailed assaying in relation to antimony ore grade content in the samples.\nEncouraging preliminary analysis has already been obtained onsite using a portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) instrument, which returned indicative results in excess of 40 per cent. antimony.\nThis work is part of follow up actions being taken by the Company to demonstrate the antimony potential of Clontibret and in particular to further evaluate the second antimony trend identified by the initial results from remodelling the Clontibret deposit (as announced by the Company on 27\nth\nFebruary 2025\n).\nWork continues on completing the relogging of drill core from the deposit and the construction of a more robust 3D geological model, in tandem with follow up exploration activity in relation to antimony.\nMr\nJohn Sherman\n, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThe discoveries of antimony float which show high gold grades further highlight both the antimony potential of the Clontibret deposit and its correlation to potentially high-grade gold.\nWe are looking forward to exploring the potential of the second antimony trend identified recently to increase the scale of the gold resource within the existing resource footprint.\nThe Company also intends to apply to the European Commission for recognition of Clontibret as a strategic project under the European Critical Raw Materials Act 2024 on the basis of the antimony content\n.\"\nHistorically, the Clontibret area was known for its small-scale antimony mine operations, which were active in the 18\nth\nand 19\nth\ncenturies. Channel sampling of the two historic antimony mines resulted in the first bedrock gold discovery in\nIreland\n. High antimony grades of 14.5% over 1.2 metres were previously recorded together with gold values of up to 35.0 g/t gold over 2 metres.\nHistorical references in a report by Russell 1917 (Report on the Clontibret Antimony mine, Castleblayney,\nCo Monaghan\n) had been made of a trial pit associated with the area where the float boulders were recovered.\nSome references related to the trial pit included in the Russell report are as follows:\n\"On the East bank of the stream in the townland of Lisglassan, 55 feet N.E. of the main shaft, a trial pit has been sunk to a depth of about five feet by the present proprietors. This reveals a vein bearing approximately 45\u00b0 E. of N and underlying about 45\u00b0 N.W. It has a very well-defined footwall, and fairly well-defined hanging wall, and carries a rib of excellent stibnite 8 inches wide.\"\n\"This same pit reveals another rib of antimony 3 inches wide running parallel to and under the stream the direction being approximately that of the main vein as exposed in the north drive from the main shaft. This rib is, therefore, probably, identical with one of these exposed in the drive, which has reached a point almost under the pit.\"\nThe precise location of the trial pit has been lost over time but a recently uncovered map (Figure 1 below) is believed to show the location of this trial pit which also fits the description above by Russell.\nFigure 1: Historical map with assumed location of the historic trial pit marked\n.\nMap from:\nHallissy T 1914 Explanatory Memoir to Sheet 58, illustrating parts of the Counties Armagh, Fermanagh and Monaghan. Memoirs of the geological Survey of\nIreland\n.\nConroy Gold's\nprospecting work to determine the precise location of the trial pit led to the discovery of some spectacular examples of stibnite in float.\nThe company plans to perform further work focused on uncovering the trial pit in order to progress the Company's understanding of a new second trend of antimony previously identified by the Company.\nIt will also assess the potential of this second trend to increase the overall gold content within the resource footprint.\nSignificantly, the large \"8 inches wide\" vein reported to have been visible in the trial pit is noted to be at an acute angle \"\nbearing approximately 45\u00b0 E. of N and underlying about 45\u00b0 N.W \"\nto the veins in the main mines.\nThis would reinforce the existence of the second trend (Northeast - Southwest orientation) parallel to the lithology and the stockwork zone shown from the mineralisation shells created by the pXRF antimony analysis carried out as part of the re-logging programme.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nAbout the \"Discs of Gold\" Project\nConroy Gold's\n\"Discs of Gold\" project in\nIreland\nis defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100 per cent. held under license by the Company and anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit. The Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions. The Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest. Gold occurs in multiple styles in the Company's license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit.\nThere are clear geological analogies between the \"Discs of Gold\" targets and large gold deposits in\nSoutheastern Australia\nand\nAtlantic Canada\n.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7469-0930\nTel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\n4147892_0.jpeg\n4147892_1.png"

The participants in the Fundraise include both existing and new shareholders.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Fundraise for further geological work on the Company's assets in Ireland, to continue with its activities in securing material asset-level investment, and for general working capital purposes.\nMr. John Sherman, the Company's Chairman, commented:\n\"The Board is pleased to have closed the Fundraise on an oversubscribed basis and welcomes the participation of both new and existing investors.\nI believe the presence of new, long-term oriented North American investors with deep sector experience on our shareholder register will raise the profile of the Company.\nThese investors will also contribute meaningfully to the \u201cDiscs\u201d project going forward as we progress both targeted exploration work and ongoing discussions around material strategic asset-level investment.\u201d\nAdditional information\nConroy has conditionally raised \u00a31,728,700, prior to expenses, through the issue of 17,287,000 new Ordinary Shares of \u20ac0.001 (\u201c\nOrdinary Shares\n\u201d) at a price of 10 pence per share (the \u201c\nFundraise Shares\n\u201d).\nAn application has been made for admission of the Fundraise Shares to trading on AIM, which is expected to occur on or around Thursday 9 October 2025 (\u201c\nAdmission\n\u201d).\nThe Fundraise has been conducted within the Company\u2019s existing share authorities and allotment is conditional upon Admission.\nEach Fundraise Share will be accompanied by a warrant to subscribe for one further Ordinary Share at a price of 17.0p at any time in the next two years (the \u201c\nWarrants\n\u201d).\nThe Fundraise Shares, or any Ordinary Shares being issued as a result of any exercise of Warrants, are subject to a restricted or 'lock-in' period ending 4 months from the date of allotment of the Fundraise Shares.\nThe participants in the Fundraise are primarily long-term value investors from North America.\nOf these shareholders, Mr. Ryan Matthiesen has subscribed for 3,000,000 Fundraise Shares, increasing his overall shareholding to 3,650,000 Ordinary Shares and Mr. Lowell Schmidt has subscribed for 2,500,000 Fundraise Shares, and consequently, are expected to hold 5.04 per cent. and 3.45 per cent. respectively of the enlarged ordinary share capital of the Company on Admission.\nOn Admission, and for the purposes of the FCA Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, the Company's total issued voting share capital will consist of 72,391,175 Ordinary Shares with one voting right per ordinary share.\nThe above figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company, under the FCA\u2019s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nAbout the \u2018Discs of Gold\u2019 project\nConroy\u2019s \u2018Discs of Gold\u2019 project in\nIreland\nis defined by two parallel district scale gold trends, extending over c.90km, which are 100 per cent. held under license by the Company, anchored by the Clontibret gold deposit. The Clontibret target area contains a currently defined 517Koz gold resource @ 2.0 g/t Au (320Koz Au Indicated and 197Koz Au Inferred (2017)) which remains open in multiple directions. The Company has identified a further seven gold targets in its license area with the Clay Lake and Creenkill gold targets being of particular interest.\nGold occurs in multiple styles in the Company\u2019s license area, including free gold, refractory gold in arsenopyrite and gold associated with pyrite and antimony (stibnite), suggesting multiple hydrothermal events seeded the deposit. There are clear geological analogies between the \u201cDiscs of Gold\u201d targets and large gold deposits in\nSoutheastern Australia\nand\nAtlantic Canada.\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nJohn Sherman, Chairman\nMaureen Jones, Managing Director\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7469-0930\nTel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\n4247072_0.jpeg"

The drill hole intersected 30.0 metres at 0.42% combined Zinc and Lead from 9.0 metres including 3.0 metres at 0.83% Zinc and Lead combined from 34.0 metres.\nDrill hole ML-22-005, 100 metres to the east of drill hole ML-22-004, was drilled to a down hole depth of 264.0 metres, at a 50 degree dip. The drill hole intersected Zinc and Lead mineralisation including 25.0 metres grading 0.26% Zinc and Lead combined from a down hole depth of 11.0 metres and including 1.0 metre grading 1.05% Zinc and Lead combined from 20.0 metres.\nThe two scout drill holes demonstrate that wide zones (30 metres and 25 metres) of Zinc mineralisation are present at a low grade. Only a 275 metre portion of the 800 metre wide section of the Zinc soil anomaly has been tested to date. This leaves over 500 metres of width to the West, where some of the highest Zinc in soil values (3,700ppm Zn) have been returned.\nFurther drilling of the anomaly to test for higher grades in this large Zinc anomaly will be carried out.\nThe sphalerite (Zinc ore) mineralisation at Mountain Lodge occurs in fractures around small shear zones as well as in quartz veins.\nZinc and Lead intercepts from drill holes ML-22-004 and ML-22-005 at Mountain Lodge include:\nHole ID\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nIntercept (m)\nZn (%)\nPb (%)\nZn + Pb (%)\nML-22-004\n9.0\n39.0\n30.0\n0.37\n0.05\n0.42\nIncl.\n34.0\n37.0\n3.0\n0.68\n0.15\n0.83\nML-22-004\n44.0\n47.0\n3.0\n0.44\nML-22-004\n69.0\n70.0\n1.0\n0.32\nML-22-004\n73.0\n74.0\n1.0\n0.27\nHole ID\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nIntercept (m)\nZn (%)\nPb (%)\nZn + Pb (%)\nML-22-005\n11.0\n36.0\n25.0\n0.22\n0.03\n0.26\nIncl.\n12.0\n21.0\n9.0\n0.32\n0.04\n0.36\nIncl.\n20.0\n21.0\n1.0\n0.92\n0.13\n1.05\n(Only intercepts of 1 metre or greater with 0.25 % Zn+Pb combined or greater are presented)\nAll samples were analysed by ALS (OMAC Laboratories) Loughrea using trace level four-acid digestion with ICP-AES analysis ME-ICP61 25g.\nBase metal licences in\nNorthern Ireland\nare issued by the Department for the Economy,\nNorthern Ireland\n. In relation to precious metals Mines Royal options have been issued to the Company by the Crown Estate.\nThere are separate work commitments for base metals and precious metals.\nThis release has been approved by Kevin McNulty PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a BSc/MSc in Geology and Remote Sensing, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman, commented:\n\"These results from the first scout holes in this extensive anomaly are encouraging. The wide intersections indicate the potential for base metals in an area which was once known as the Armagh Monaghan Mining District.\nWe look forward to following up, in due course, on the positive base metal results which these scout holes have demonstrated, in addition to progressing the Company's highly successful gold exploration programme in the region.\"\nFor further information please contact\n:\nConroy Gold and Natural Resources PLC\nTel:\n+353-1-479-6180\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nTel:\n+44-20-3328-5656\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\nLothbury Financial Services\nTel:\n+44-20-7469-0930\nTel:\n+44-20-3290-0707\nMichael Padley\nHall Communications\nTel:\n+353-1-660-9377\nDon Hall\nVisit the website at:\nwww.conroygold.com\n3975387_0.jpeg"
