The Company expects to enter into a binding agreement in due course with regards to a transaction that may lead to a Reverse Takeover. The target company is a healthcare group with a Philippine subsidiary, Dialysis Care Plus Inc, that is building dialysis centres in the Philippines where the market for dialysis services is growing substantially every year. The team has an excellent track record with internationally known healthcare groups in the USA as well as locally in the Philippines. The valuation approach that is being considered is one whereby upon a successful transaction the valuation paid would be based upon a share consideration and a deferred share consideration determined by financial performance. The Company expects to conclude matters shortly and will provide further updates to the market this month.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION EU 596/2014 (\"MAR\").\nEnquiries:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk, Non-Executive Chairman\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Half Yearly Financial Report will also shortly be available via the National Storage Mechanism.\nThe Company expects to announce shortly a potential transaction with a view to a Reverse Takeover.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION EU 596/2014 (\"MAR\").\nEnquiries:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk, Non-Executive Chairman\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nAmala Foods PLC\nFinancial Report\nFor the Half-Year Ended 30 September 2023\n(Unaudited)\nREPORT OF THE DIRECTORS\nThe Directors present the report together with the unaudited interim financial statements for the Company for the half-year ended 30 September 2023.\nThe Company\nAmala Foods Plc is registered (registered number 121041) and domiciled in Jersey. It was incorporated on 11 April 2016\n.\nPrincipal Activity and Business Review\nThe Company's principal activity during the period ended 30 September 2023 was a cash shell company. The Directors are actively seeking new opportunities that will lead to a Reverse Takeover.\nResults and Dividends\nThe results of the Company for the half-year ended 30 September 20\n23\nshow a loss before taxation of GBP 39,602\n(30 September 2022\nshowed a loss of GBP 82,631\n).\nNo dividends have been paid during the half-year ended 30 September 20\n23\nor during the comparative period.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal business risks that have been identified are as below.\nTransaction Risk\nThere is no guarantee that a suitable transaction will be identified and will be successfully completed, resulting in a Reverse Takeover. Even if a transaction is successful, there is no guarantee that the Directors will be successful in managing the new business and derive the value that is hoped. Should a transaction not complete, once identified, then the Directors will need to invest further time and resources in identifying another suitable target company.\nFunding Risk\nThe Company has not yet achieved profitability and is therefore reliant on periodically raising finance to fund its expenditure. There can be no guarantees that additional capital will be available when required\n. Whilst the Company raised GBP 405,000 in Convertible Loan Notes, there is no guarantee that further capital will be available if and when required to complete a transaction that will result in a Reverse Takeover or that further capital will be available to fund an enlarged group after the completion of a transaction. The Directors have taken steps to conserve cash including not receiving any remuneration until there is a successful Reverse Takeover.\nKey Personnel Risk\nThe Company is dependent on the experience and abilities of its Directors. Whilst the Company does not expect any of the Directors to leave the Company, if such individuals were to leave the Company, and the Company was unable to attract suitable experienced personnel, it could have a negative impact on the future prospects of the Company\n.\nEvents after the Reporting Period\nRefer note 9 of the unaudited interim financial statements.\nCompany Directors\nPosition\nAppointment Date\nAudit\nCommittee\nRemuneration Committee\nJonathan Morley-Kirk\nNon-Executive Chairman\n16 April 2016\nAidan Bishop\nExecutive Director\n16 April 2016\n-\n-\nCelia Li\nNon-Executive Director\n17 March 2023\nShare Capital\nAt 30 September 2023,\nthe issued share capital of the Company stood at 466,920,137 - with 23,299,314 new shares having been issued during the period (refer note 9 of the unaudited interim financial statements).\nThis Directors' Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 8 November 2023 and is signed on its behalf.\nBy Order of the Board\nJonathan Morley-Kirk\nChairman\n8 November\n2023\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the half-year ended 30 September 20\n23\n30 Sep 20\n23\n30\nSep 2022\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nNote GBP GBP\nAdministrative expenses (39,602\n)\n(\n91,327)\nFair value gain 7\n-\n8,696\nLoss before taxation (39,602\n) (82,631)\nIncome tax expense - -\nLoss for the period\n4\n(39,602\n) (82,631)\nEarnings per share:\nBasic and diluted loss per share 6 (0.00\n01) (0.0002)\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these financial statements.\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nat 30 September 20\n23\n30 Sep 20\n23\n3\n0 Sep 2022\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nNote GBP GBP\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables 5\n101,189 94,675\nCash and cash equivalents 209,742\n10,743\n310,931\n105,418\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables (74,570)\n(\n101,335\n)\nBorrowings (1,092,569)\n(\n627,537\n)\n(\n1,167,139\n)\n(728,872)\nNet assets/(liabilities)\n(856,208)\n(623,454)\nEquity\nIssued share capital 6 6,\n568,640\n6,\n488,490\nRetained earnings\n(8,080,872) (8,883,963)\nOther Reserves 8\n661,104\n1,772,019\nTotal equity\n(856,208)\n(623,454)\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these financial statements.\nThese financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\nJonathan Morley-Kirk\nChairman\n8 November\n2023\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nat 30 September 20\n23\nShare Retained Other Total Capital Earnings Reserves Equity\nGBP GBP GBP GBP\nMarch 2022\n6,488,490 (8,801,332) 1,714,715 (598,127)\nLoss for the period\n-\n(82,631)\n-\n(82,631)\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n-\n(82,631)\n-\n(82,631)\nWarrants reserves - - (8,696) (8,696)\nShares to be issued reserve - - 66,000 66,000\nTotal transactions with owners\n-\n-\n57,304 57,304\nAt 30 Se\nptember 2022 (unaudited)\n6,488,490 (8,883,963)\n1,772,019 (623,454)\nLoss for the period\n-\n(357,445)\n-\n(357,445)\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n-\n(357,445)\n-\n(357,445)\nShares to be issued waived - 201,000 (267,000) (66,000)\nContingent shares to be issued to Directors - - 125,000 125,000\nExpired and cancelled options\n- 994,058 (994,058) -\nOptions reserve - - 16,441 16,441\nWarrants reserve - - 8,696 8,696\nTotal transactions with owners\n-\n1,195,058\n(1,110,921) 84,137\nAt 31 March 2023\n6,488,490 (8,046,350) 661,098 (896,762)\nLoss for the period\n-\n(39,602)\n-\n(39,602)\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n-\n(39,602)\n-\n(39,602)\nIssue of new ordinary shares (net) 80,150 - - 80,150\nShares to be issued reserve - - 6 6\nTotal transactions with owners\n80,150\n-\n6 80,156\nAt 30 Se\nptember 2023 (unaudited)\n6,568,640 (8,085,952)\n661,104 (856,208)\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these financial statements\n.\nCASH FLOW STATEMENT\nFor the half-year ended 30 September 20\n23\n30 Sep 20\n23\n30\nSep 2022\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nNote GBP GBP\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash paid to suppliers (\n108,475) (9,124)\nNet cash from operating activities (\n108,475) (9,124)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash\n(\n108,475)\n(\n9,124)\nCash and cash equivalents at start of period\n318,217\n19,867\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n209,742\n10,743\nThe accompanying notes form an integral part of these financial statements\n.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the half-year ended 30 September 20\n23\n1.\nBASIS OF PREPARATION AND ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS)\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of UK adopted International Accounting Standards and expected to be effective at the year-end of 31 March 2024. The accounting policies are unchanged from the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023. The interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 (IAS 34) as adopted by the European Union, are unaudited. Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2023, prepared in accordance with IFRS, have been filed. The Auditors' Report on those accounts was unqualified, but did include a material uncertainty in respect of going concern.\nThe interim financial statements are for the six months to 30 September 2023. The interim consolidated financial information does not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023.\n2.\nGOING CONCERN\nThe Company entered into a Deed of Standstill with a creditor to reprofile outstanding debt to a reduced amount of GBP 787,719 (amended further in April 2023 with the conversion of shares to the value of GBP 80,150 - refer note 9 of the unaudited interim financial statements) that would convert to shares at the re-admission price upon a Reverse Takeover and that no interest will accrue and for all existing warrants to be cancelled upon a Reverse Takeover. Should a Reverse Takeover not take place then the creditor may call upon cash repayment. Given the passage of time, agreements have been made with certain of these parties that the cash repayments will not be called upon despite the due dates passing.\nFurthermore, the Company raised GBP 405,000 in Convertible Loan Notes that would be largely utilised to fund a transaction leading to a Reverse Takeover. These Convertible Loan Notes are automatically converted into shares upon a Reverse Takeover. However, the holders of the convertible loan notes may call upon cash repayment should there be no Reverse Takeover.\nHaving prepared and reviewed cashflow forecasts, the Directors have ascertained that further finance will need to be raised should the convertible loans be required to be repaid in cash in the next 12 months. The Directors are confident that should the convertible loan notes, in part or in full, require repayment then they would be able to raise sufficient funds to be able to make such repayments whilst still funding the Company's forecasted expenditure. They are also confident of a transaction occurring and therefore the share conversion option of the convertibles presenting the best value opportunity to holders. The Company has been reviewing several potential transactions but as completion of a reverse takeover by the required dates and thus avoiding cash repayment of the convertible loan notes is not guaranteed and given the requirement to raise further funds in such an event within the next 12 months, they acknowledge that a material uncertainty relating to going concern exists.\nThe accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.\n3.\nSEGMENTAL REPORTING\nThe Company's operating segments are based on geographical location and determined solely as Jersey.\n4.\nLOSS FOR THE PERIOD BEFORE TAX\n30 Sep 2023 30 Sep 2022\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nGBP GBP\nLoss for the period has been arrived at after charging:\nDirectors remuneration - 70,000\nThe directors did not receive any remuneration in the form of share based payments, post-employment benefits, termination benefits or other long-term benefits in the periods ended 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022. The Directors agreed to not receive any remuneration due for the period prior to and during the suspension of the listing and until a transaction is completed that leads to a Reverse Takeover - at 31 March 2023, GBP 125,000 was shown as due to Directors and to be issued in equity at the readmission price\n, which is\ncontingent\non the successful Reverse Takeover.\n5.
