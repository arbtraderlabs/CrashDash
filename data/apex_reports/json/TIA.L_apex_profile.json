We are maintaining a strong current sales pipeline of \u00a38m annual value while continuing to grow our partner base with the addition of a large global system integrator in Q2 2025.\nPost period end and as previously announced, Tialis was awarded a significant follow-on framework agreement from a long-standing and valued customer.\nThe expanded agreement, valued at approximately \u00a350 million, builds on the Company's previous work with the long-standing customer and will run over 5 years. Under the new framework, Tialis will deliver Lifecycle Services, Tech Bars, End User Support and Field Engineering supporting the long-standing customer's business.\nThis follow-on award reflects the strength and depth of the Company's relationship with the long-standing customer and demonstrates the high level of customer satisfaction with the delivery record of Tialis. It will further enhance the Group's order book and revenue visibility for the next financial year.\nTialis was awarded a material new contract with one of the UK Government's principal departments overseeing environmental policy, agriculture, and rural community development, as previously announced. We commenced delivery of this contract on 1 September 2025. The contract, with a total value of approximately \u00a315 million, will run over 5 years and involves the delivery of Lifecycle Services, Tech Bars, End User Support and Field Engineering, supporting this large UK Government Department build the workplace of tomorrow. The award follows a competitive tender process and further strengthens the Tialis order book, increasing contracted revenue visibility for the current financial year and beyond and is expected to deliver significant additional project revenue in its lifetime. This win is consistent with the Company's stated strategy of building long-term, high-value client relationships.\nRevenues in the period were lower than the prior period, primarily due to delayed customer orders in the context of a challenging financial market environment. The Board believes these conditions are cyclical and that underlying demand for the Group's services remains robust. The loss of two significant contracts which were both in-sourced by the end-customers earlier than originally anticipated with the channel partners has also impacted the revenues.\nThe Group enters the second half of 2025 with a strong pipeline and a sharpened focus on strategic growth areas. Management expects further progress in Lifecycle services, continued partner expansion, and a stronger H2 performance.\nLeveraging on the continued success of the Allvotec acquisition in 2023, Tialis has been able to agree renewals and extensions of the existing contracts, increasing the deferred and contingent consideration settlement agreed with Daisy HoldCo Limited to \u00a31.638 million. This will be paid in shares issued in Tialis Essential IT PLC, at an effective price of 70 pence per ordinary share. This increase of \u00a3582k (FY 2024: \u00a3971k) is shown as a fair value adjustment on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nAs announced in the final results for the year ended 31 December 2024, Tialis has undertaken or is planning to undertake several new deals to expand its activities and to deliver growth through acquisition with synergistic targets to deepen its service offerings. The opportunity has now arisen to consolidate several investments into Tialis, to accrete shareholder value today and for the future. This will create the ability to manage a pool of permanent capital and assets, leverage the cashflow from those into dividends and create further capital growth.\nAI Auxesis\nIn April 2025, the creation of the Subsidiary, AI Auxesis Limited required an upfront investment of \u00a3250,000 that has been used to fund its first consulting project which has started generating revenue. This investment was 50% funded by the Company and the remaining 50% funded by direct contributions of \u00a362,500 made into the Subsidiary by both Ian\u00a0Smith, Executive Director of the Company, and Andy Mills, in exchange for 25% of the shares each in the Subsidiary. As non-corporate shareholders, both Ian and Andy are entitled to a 10% per shareholder uncapped profit share on any capital gain in the underlying investment in the Subsidiary (the \"Profit Share\"). The Company contributed \u00a3125,000 to the Subsidiary. In order to meet this contribution to the Subsidiary, the Company conducted a direct subscription in the Company's ordinary shares at 60 pence per share, being the mid-market closing price on 8 April 2025 (the \"Subscription Shares\"). This was then passed on to the Subsidiary. In total the Company issued 208,333 Subscription Shares for cash for a total of approximately \u00a3125,000 (the \"Subscription\"). The subscribers to this fundraise were Ian and Andy in equal proportion to each other at 50% each in return for their respective 25% holdings in the Subsidiary.\nAI Auxesis is pleased to report a strong start to its partnership with QPC, culminating in the signing of a global partnership agreement with Genesys, a $2.1B-per-quarter, US-headquartered leader in contact centre solutions, serving over 8,000 enterprise customers since 1990.\nIn parallel, QPC has entered into a new strategic alliance with IPI, a specialist in Contact Centre, Cloud, and Connectivity services, further strengthening the international partner ecosystem. QPC also has further significant new-logo wins, including: A major telecommunications group in the Middle East, two international banking institutions, and one of the world's most prestigious luxury automotive manufacturers.\nCommenting on QPC's momentum, Chief Revenue Officer Andy Mills stated: \"Momentum continues to build rapidly. Our strategic focus on delivering the most granular level of CX data to power AI solutions continues to drive ARR, underpinned by strong enterprise pipeline growth across both global partners and direct customers. We're extremely pleased with the momentum and the calibre of customers engaging with our platform.\"\nThese developments mark a critical inflection point in AI Auxesis' commercial trajectory and underline the growing market demand for our AI-driven solutions.\nDigital Petcare UK Limited\nIn June 2025, Tialis acquired a loan agreement from MXC Capital Guernsey Limited (\"MXC\") between MXC and Digital Petcare UK Limited (\"Digital Petcare\"). The loan has an outstanding value of \u00a31.485m and carries an interest rate of 12%. The loan was placed into a newly created subsidiary of Tialis called Tialis Essential IT Debt Limited.\nSince the acquisition of the Digital Petcare loan, Tialis has completed a debt refinancing and decided to back Susie Samuel, founder and CEO of Digital Petcare, with a conversion of debt to equity alongside further investments from shareholders and outside investors. The refinancing was structured as follows:\n\u2022 \u00a3500k has been converted into a 14.14% equity holding in Digital Petcare\n\u2022 \u00a3700k has been refinanced into a new loan over 24 months at the same interest rate of 12%\n\u2022 \u00a3285k of the loan has been repaid\nCloudCoCo Group PLC\nAdditionally in June 2025, Tialis also acquired MXC's outstanding equity position, of approximately 10.6%, in CloudCoCo Group PLC (\"CloudCoCo\"). The investment was placed into a newly created subsidiary of Tialis called Tialis Essential IT Investments Limited.\nBoard Changes\nOn 8 September 2025, Tialis welcomed Rachel Horsefield and Peter Hallett to the Board as Non-Executive Directors.\nRachel was the Chief Executive Officer of THG Beauty Limited, a global retailer and brand owner operating through two leading predominantly online consumer businesses, LookFantastic and Cult Beauty. During her ten years with THG Beauty, Rachel worked with over 800 of the world's most popular brands and has a wealth of digital and beauty experience. Prior to joining THG Rachel was with Boots where she held a number of roles within ecommerce. Rachel has advised numerous listed and private companies in board positions across the digital and retail sectors.\nPeter, a qualified chartered accountant, is a highly experienced plc non-executive director and chief financial officer with multi-sector expertise including technology, FMCG manufacturing and retail in national and multi-national corporates. He is the senior independent non-executive director of Altitude Group plc, an AIM listed technology company mainly US based. Peter is the co-founder, investor and strategic consultant to Merchr Limited, a private start-up technology business providing a comprehensive end to end cloud based platform providing a total outsource solution for personalised merchandise to major global brands.\nPost Balance Sheet Events\nOn 7 July 2025, there was a share issue of 2,631,134 shares at 64p per share which was used to fund the acquisitions on 30 June 2025.\nPost the interim announcement, there will be a General Meeting held to approve the new shares to be issued to Daisy HoldCo Limited of 2,339,883 shares to settle the amounts owed as mentioned above.\nOutlook\nThe Board remains cautious given the current macroeconomic environment but is encouraged by the Group's resilient performance to date. With a focus on maintaining financial discipline and operational efficiency, the Board expects trading for the full year to remain in line with current market expectations. The Group is well placed to navigate ongoing market uncertainties while continuing to protect shareholder value.\nIan Smith said: \"I am pleased to report that, in line with our stated strategy of establishing a pool of capital, we have successfully completed our first acquisition. I am delighted to welcome our new non-executive directors who will be instrumental in supporting us on this journey. This represents an exceptional opportunity for Tialis to deliver meaningful accretion in shareholder value, both today and into the future. The ability to manage a pool of permanent capital and assets, while leveraging the cashflow generated into sustainable dividends and further capital growth, was an opportunity simply too good to miss.\"\nFor more information, contact:\nTialis Essential IT Plc\nIan Smith, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)344 874 1000\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nCorporate finance: Jonny Franklin-Adams / Elysia Bough\nCorporate Broking: Tim Redfern\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nFinancial\nReview\nResults for the six months to 30 June\n2025\nRevenue from continuing operations for the six months to 30 June 2025 from operations was \u00a38.8 million (H1 2024: \u00a310.7\u00a0million). Revenues in the period were lower than the prior period, primarily due to delayed customer orders in the context of a challenging financial market environment. The Board believes these conditions are cyclical and that underlying demand for the Group's services remains robust. The loss of two significant contracts which were both in-sourced by the end-customers earlier than originally contracted with the channel partners has also impacted the revenues.\nGross profit from continuing operations for the six months to 30 June 2025 was \u00a32.6 million (H1 2024: \u00a33.0 million), representing an overall improvement in gross margin to 29.2% for H1 2025 as compared to the prior period of 28.0%.\nAt an Adjusted EBITDA* level for continuing operations the Group generated a profit of \u00a31.0 million (H1 2024: \u00a30.9million). The Group has continued to rationalize overheads and improve on the cost efficiencies identified during FY2024. This has resulted in an improvement in the gross margin percentage and the Adjusted EBITDA*\n.\nLeveraging on the continued success of the Allvotec acquisition in 2023, Tialis has been able to agree renewals and extensions of the existing contracts, increasing the deferred and contingent consideration settlement agreed with Daisy HoldCo Limited to \u00a31.638 million. This will be paid in shares issued in Tialis Essential IT PLC, at an effective price of 70 pence per ordinary share. This increase of \u00a3582k (FY 2024: \u00a3971k) is shown as a fair value adjustment on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nExceptional costs amounted to \u00a30.1 million (H1 2024: \u00a30.2 million) and related predominantly to group restructuring, predominantly redundancy costs. Going forward, Tialis expects exceptional costs to decrease.\nNet financial costs were \u00a30.2 million (H1 2024: \u00a30.3 million), which has decreased due to the early repayment of the loan notes in H2 2024.\nThe loss after tax for the period was \u00a30.9 million (H1 2024: loss of \u00a30.9 million).\nLoss per share was 3.58p (H1 2024: loss per share 3.82p).\nBalance Sheet\nThe substantial increase in trade and other receivables was mainly attributable to the short-term loan receivable acquired on 30 June 2025. As noted above, this was refinanced in July.\nThe substantial increase in trade and other payables is the purchase price of \u00a31.685m for the acquisitions made on 30\u00a0June\u00a02025 which was settled in shares on 7 July 2025 and \u00a31.638m for the deferred consideration owed to Daisy HoldCo Limited, which will be settled in shares in early October 2025.\nCashflow and Net Debt\nThe Group's cash generated from operating activities in the period was \u00a30.3 million (H1 2024: \u00a31.4 million. The second half is expected to be stronger, with improvements in working capital and a continued reduction in exceptionals.\nThe Group invested \u00a30.02 million in fixed assets and acquire \u00a30.1m in cash as a result of the acquisition of AI Auxesis in April 2025.\nThere were no new borrowings. The repayment of the bank borrowings consumed \u00a30.5 million (H1 2024: \u00a3nil). The repayment of lease liabilities consumed \u00a30.2 million (H1 2024: \u00a30.1 million).

This statement has not been reviewed by the Company's auditor. This condensed consolidated interim financial information was approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 9 September 2025. A copy of this half-yearly financial report is available on the Company's website at\nwww.tialis.com.\nThe comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 are extracted from but do not comprise the Group's consolidated financial statements for that year.\nThe Company is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Scotland. The address of its registered office is 24 Dublin Street, Edinburgh EH1 3PP. The Company is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.\nTialis and its subsidiaries have not applied IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the United Kingdom, which is not mandatory for UK AIM listed companies, in the preparation of this half-yearly financial report.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial information for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025 therefore does not comply with all the requirements of IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the United Kingdom. The consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the United Kingdom.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial information does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 9 May 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nAccounting\npolicies\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom and are consistent with those that will be adopted in the annual statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2025.\nWhile the financial information included has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of IFRS, as adopted by the United Kingdom, these financial statements do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRSs. The accounting policies adopted in the interim financial statements are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024\n.\nNon-underlying\nitems\nIt is the policy of the Group to identify certain costs, which are material either because of their size or nature, separately on the face of the Income Statement in order that the underlying profitability of the business can be clearly understood. These costs are identified as non-underlying items, and comprise:\na) Professional fees incurred in sourcing and completing acquisitions and disposals including legal expenses\nb) Professional fees incurred in restructuring and refinancing acquisitions\nc) Integration costs which are incurred by the Group when integrating one trading business into another, including rebranding of acquired businesses\nd) Redundancy costs, including employment related costs of staff made redundant up to the date of their leaving as a consequence of integration\ne) Property costs such as lease termination penalties and vacant property provisions and third-party advisor fee\nFor further details, please refer to note 3.\nGoing\nconcern\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information has been prepared on a going concern\nbasis.\nThe Directors have produced detailed trading and cashflow forecasts. In reaching their conclusion on the going concern basis of accounting, the Directors note and rely on the improved trading performance, the positive cash generation that the business is now experiencing and the current signed order book. A reverse stress test of the model has been run to determine at what level of shortfall in revenues the Group would run out of cash. Given the committed orders already obtained and the visibility of future revenues, the directors do not consider it likely that revenues could drop to such an extent that the Group would run out of cash.\nThey have also considered the impact of any delayed customer payments and have developed plans to mitigate any such delays to ensure that the group can continue to settle its liabilities as they fall due and operate as a going concern. The directors therefore have an expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources available to them to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable basis. For this reason, the Directors consider that the adoption of the going concern basis is appropriate.\n2.\nSegment\nreporting\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") has been identified as the executive directors of the Company and its subsidiaries, who review the Group's internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.\nThe CODM assess profit performance principally through adjusted profit measures consistent with those disclosed in these interim financial statements. The Board believes that the Group comprises of two reporting segments, being the provision of the end-to-end IT solutions, concentrating on end-user device management and on-site support solutions and an AI consulting services.\nWhilst the CODM reviews the revenue streams and related gross margins of the two categories separately (IT solutions and Consulting services), the operating costs and asset base used to derive these revenue streams are the same for both categories and are presented as such in the Group's internal reporting.\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2025\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nAudited\nYear\nended\n31\nDecember\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRevenue\nIT solutions\n8,804\n10,740\n20,842\nConsulting services\n44\n-\n-\nTotal revenue\n8,848\n10,740\n20,842\nGross Profit\nIT solutions\n2,550\n3,012\n6,012\nConsulting services\n38\n-\n-\nTotal gross profit\n2,588\n3,012\n6,012\n3.\nNon-underlying\ncosts\nIn accordance with the Group's policy in respect of non-underlying costs, the following charges were incurred for the period in relation to continuing operations:\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2025\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nAudited\nYear\nended\n31\nDecember\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nAcquisition fees in the period\n14\n101\n103\nEmployee share option plan set-up expense\n-\n-\n2\nOne-off legal fees\n(20)\n-\n55\nLoan note consultancy fees\n-\n-\n79\nRestructuring and reorganisation costs\n100\n54\n449\n94\n155\n688\nRestructuring and reorganisation costs in the period relate to costs incurred on the restructure of the Group, predominantly redundancy costs. The redundancy costs include employment related costs of staff made redundant because of restructuring. The legal expenses were non-recurring expenses incurred during the year.\n4.\nEarnings per share from continuing\noperations\nThe calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is based on results from continuing operations attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares for the purpose of calculating the basic and diluted measures in the reporting periods is the same. This is because the outstanding options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and therefore would be anti-dilutive under the terms of IAS 33. Basic and diluted unaudited loss per share from continuing operations are calculated as follows:\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2025\n\u00a3000\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\n\u00a3000\nAudited\nYear\nended\n31\nDecember\n2024\n\u00a3000\nLoss for the period after taxation\n(869)\n(928)\n(3,194)\nWeighted average number of\nshares\n24,285,800\n24,246,744\n24,303,502\nDiluted weighted average number of\nshares\n24,285,800\n24,246,744\n24,303,502\nBasic loss per share\n(pence)\n(3.58)\np\n(3.82)\np\n(13.11)\np\nDiluted loss per share\n(pence)\n(3.58)\np\n(3.82)\np\n(13.11)\np\n5.\nBorrowings\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2025\n\u00a3000\nUnaudited\nSix months\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\n\u00a3000\nAudited\nYear\nended\n31\nDecember\n2024\n\u00a3000\nNon-\nCurrent\nLease liabilities\n187\n477\n391\nBank borrowings\n3,516\n-\n4,021\nLoan\nNotes\n337\n487\n314\n4,040\n964\n4,686\nCurrent\nLease liabilities\n337\n295\n325\nLoan\nNotes\n-\n3,730\n-\n337\n4,025\n325\nThe carrying value is not materially different to the fair value of these liabilities.\nIn January 2019 the Company issued \u00a35.3 million of secured loan notes with a six-year term and a 12% coupon which is compounded, rolled up and payable at the end of the term (\"Loan Notes\"). In February and March 2019, a further \u00a34.7 million in total of secured Loan Notes were issued. The Loan Notes carry an arrangement fee of 2.5 per cent., payable at the end of the term, and an exit fee of 2.5 per cent, also payable at the end of the term. The security comprises a debenture over all the assets of the Group.\nIn December 2019 the Company issued an additional \u00a31.5 million of Loan Notes (with the same terms as those issued in the first quarter of the year).\nThe Loan Notes are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate for the Loan Notes has been calculated to be 18%.\nThe Company issued a further loan note (\"Loan Note 2025\") net of expenses for proceeds of \u00a31m on 1 December 2021. The terms of the loan were that the rate of interest is 1.5% per month if repaid by 31 January 2022, 2.5% per month if repaid by 28\u00a0February\u00a02022 and 3% per month if repaid by 31 March 2022. If not repaid by 31 March 2022 the amount due at that date including fees (\u00a31.1875m) is then subject to interest at 20.4% per annum compound. The maturity date is 23 December 2025. The Loan Note 2025 was included in the 2 November 2022 conversion.\nOn 2 November 2022 the members meeting at the Annual General Meeting, and then at the General Meeting that followed, voted to convert \u00a325.5 million of loan notes (including fees and interest) into share capital.\nThe bank borrowings are a revolving credit facility with a termination date of 8 September 2027, with a weighted interest rate comprising of a margin of 3.75% per annum plus the SONIA (Sterling overnight index average) reference rate. Each member of the group is a guarantor and grants security as the lender may require.\nThe Group has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities during the 30 June 2025 reporting period.\n6.\nConvertible Loan\nNotes\nUnaudited\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2025\n\u00a3000\nUnaudited\nSix months\nended\n30 June\n2024\n\u00a3000\nAudited\nYear\nended\n31\nDecember\n2024\n\u00a3000\nBalance at\nthe\nbeginning of\nthe\nperiod\n314\n-\n-\nNew loan issued\n-\n-\n300\nInterest accrued\n23\n-\n14\nBalance at the end of the period\n337\n-\n314\nOn 9 September 2024, the Company issued \u00a30.3million of an unsecured loan note to MXC Capital Limited, which carries an interest rate of 15% and is for a term of 3 years 3 months (\"CLN\"). The CLN holder may convert all outstanding notes together with all accrued but unpaid interest shall into fully paid Ordinary Shares at the Conversion Price of 40p per ordinary share.\n7.\nRelated Party Transactions\nIan Smith, Executive Director at 30 June 2025, held 2.64% of the Company's issued share capital through his Self-Invested Pension Plan and in his own name. Ian Smith is also Chief Executive Officer and a substantial shareholder of MXC Capital Limited (MXC). MXC owned 75.22% of the issued share capital of the Company at 30 June 2025. Together, Ian Smith and MXC owned 77.86% of the issued share capital of the Company at 30 June 2025.\nDuring the year, the Group and Company paid MXC Capital Markets LLP, a subsidiary of MXC, for corporate finance advice and other services amounting to \u00a37,500 (30 June 2024: \u00a315,000).

Immediately following the capital reorganisation, the loan notes (\"Loan Notes\") held by MXC were converted into equity, reducing the debt level of the group to a sensible level. Note 27 sets-out in detail the Company's capital reorganisation.\nManage\nDuring 2022, Tialis Essential IT Manage Limited's turnover remained consistent at \u00a314.5 million (2021: \u00a314.5 million).\nAdjusted EBITDA for Manage, before unallocated group overheads, decreased from \u00a33.8 million to \u00a32.6 million, this reflects the change in business mix and a decrease in one-off projects experienced in 2022.\nFor the 2023 financial year, we have a higher level of visibility over revenues. It is anticipated that the successful transition of some of our traditional service contracts into our lifecycle facility will see margins step back up year on year.\nEmployee numbers within the Manage business increased by 15% within the year due to the company taking on more onsite managed service contracts. The number of heads in our central function decreased by 12 in the year.\nHighlights in the year include:\n\u00b7\nThe sale of IDE Connect in October 2021 enabled the company to return to profit (before finance costs) in 2022 and allowed us to concentrate on end user device and on-site support services rather than chase the market in many different directions.\n\u00b7\nAlthough revenue for 2022 was flat on 2021, the company is fundamentally stronger as the income is derived from recurring revenue. 2021 revenue was bolstered by a number of very large, one-off projects.\n\u00b7\nThe acquisition of the\nprofitable partner contracts from Allvotec Limited, a division of Daisy Group,\nadds circa 50% to our revenues in 2023.\n\u00b7\nIn May 22, the company signed a seven figure multi-year contract with a major nuclear organisation which has doubled the annualised revenue on that account.\n\u00b7\nExtended relationship with Indian Global outsourcer to mid-2023.\n\u00b7\nContinued to expand our preferred supplier agreement with major partner and over doubled the revenue from 2021 to 2022.\n\u00b7\nVia our partnership with CloudCoCo two large charities started large lifecycle contracts across all users within their organisations.\n\u00b7\nTook over the Tech Bar support operation for major German multinational in multi-year deal.\n\u00b7\nStarted two important support relationships with large City insurance companies, which will both be experiencing significant expansion in 2023.\n\u00b7\nStarted year one of a three-year project with UK utility in 2022.\n\u00b7\nAwarded Approved Supplier status with major UK IT service provider.\n\u00b7\nIn December 2022, signed in excess of a million pound a year contract for a minimum of 3 years with major UK print company which is due to start in June 2023.\nResults\nRevenue\nremained steady\nfor the full year at \u00a314.5 million (2021 continuing operations: \u00a314.5 million), and we have seen gross profit margin fall by\n8\n%, from 43% to 35%. Resulting gross profit has decreased year-on-year to \u00a35.1 million (2021 continuing operations: \u00a36.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA decreased to \u00a32.0 million (2021: Adjusted EBITDA of \u00a33.1 million). The net\nloss\nafter tax\nfor the year from continuing operations is \u00a30.6 million (2021: \u00a32.0 million), after \u00a31.2 million amortisation expense and a \u00a30.9 million gain on conversion of the secured loan notes (2021 continuing operations: \u00a33.0 million amortisation and impairment charge).\nPeople\nThe management team has made continued progress in simplifying the structure of the business and aligning services better to support our clients. The board would like to recognise and thank its employees who have worked hard to deliver excellent client service and retain existing key clients. The headcount in Tialis Essential IT Manage Limited has increased by 15% reflecting increased activity and trading.\nStrategy\nOur plan is to continue with our organic initiatives that will continue to demonstrate positive growth. We intend to expand our partner network and are also looking to expansion into Europe. After four long years of restructuring the Group is now considering growth through acquisition and would consider synergistic targets that would expand and deepen our service offerings.\nFinancing and dividend\nThe Company had been exploring several options for the secured loan notes, as the final stage of its restructuring, to reduce the Company's indebtedness to allow the Company to grow organically and through acquisition.\nPrior to the secured loan note conversion on 2 November 2022, the balances owed to the loan note holders were as summarised below:\nHolder\nValue of loan notes Pre Conversion\nValue of loan notes Post Conversion at 31 December 2022\nMXC\n\u00a315,588,902\n\u00a3-\nRichard Griffiths\n\u00a31,854,546\n\u00a31,891,435\nFunds managed by Kestrel Partners LLP\n\u00a31,354,963\n\u00a31,382,896\nOther loan note holders\n\u00a3204,138\n\u00a3215,660\nTotal secured loan note value\n\u00a319,002,549\n\u00a33,489,991\nThe Company did not have adequate cash resources to repay the loan notes and therefore, after exploring several options, the Board believed that the capital reorganisation and loan note conversion was the best option available to the Company. The loan note conversion resulted in MXC materially increasing their percentage shareholding in the Company, MXC have confirmed to the Company that it has no current intention in taking the Company private.\nNote 27 sets out the full details of the capital reorganisation which took place on 2 November 2022 having been approved by the Members in General Meeting.\nThe capital reorganisation consisted of the following steps:\n1. the amendment of the Articles to set out the rights and restrictions attached to the Deferred Shares issued;\n2. the sub-division of each existing Ordinary Share into 2 new shares - a Redenominated Ordinary Share of 0.01p and a Deferred Share of \u00a32.49p; and\n3. every 100 Redenominated Ordinary Shares of 0.01p each were consolidated into one New Ordinary Share of 1p each.\nThe Board is not proposing to declare a dividend at this time,\nCurrent trading and outlook\nTrading in the current financial year remains in line with Board expectations, with current financial performance broadly in line with the same period last year (excluding Allvotec). As our business grows, we are looking to expand our partner channel and possible expansion of our business model into Europe.\nOur outlook for the year is 85% of revenue covered by existing contracts and end user customers, and together with a buoyant pipeline gives us great confidence in another positive year of growth for the Group.\nThe key objective for 2023 is to increase the focus and utilisation of our lifecycle facility which provides much greater efficiencies for our end-user customers and higher levels of customer satisfaction. Initiatives are underway with our most significant partner to see an increase in this area. In February 2023, the Group added three new large partners to the portfolio, providing the group with further opportunities.\nFinancial Review\nThe Group reported total revenues from continuing operations for the year to 31 December 2022 of \u00a314.5 million, the same as in 2021 (2021: \u00a314.5 million) and gross\nprofit of \u00a35.1 million (2021: \u00a36.3 million). This shows a reduction in margins year-on-year of 8 percentage points compared to the prior year due to a shift in revenue streams.\nThe Group uses Adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP measure of performance as it believes this more accurately reflects the underlying performance of the business. This is one of the key operational performance measures monitored by the Board. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment charges, non-underlying items, loss on disposal of fixed assets and share-based payments.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for the year to 31 December 2022 was a profit of \u00a32.0 million (2021: profit of \u00a33.1 million).\nA detailed review of the business is set out in the Chairman's Statement and this Financial Review. Included in these reviews are\ncomments\non\nthe\nkey\nperformance\nindicators\nthat\nare\nused\nby\nthe\nBoard\non a monthly basis to monitor and assess the performance of the business. These indicators include the level of revenue, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA together with net debt.\nManage\nThe revenue for the continuing operations all relates to the Manage Business. Revenues remained consistent at \u00a314.5 million (2021: \u00a314.5 million). For the year we have seen lower gross profit margins to 35% (2021: 43%), as a result of the services mix and operational efficiencies.\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Manage has moved to \u00a32.6 million (2021: profit of \u00a33.8 million).\nNon-underlying items\nNon-underlying items relating to restructuring and reorganisation amount to \u00a30.4 million in the year (2021: \u00a30.4 million).\nFinance costs\nAfter incurring net finance charges of \u00a32.3 million relating to interest and arrangement fees for loan notes, leases and bank debt (2021: \u00a32.5 million), the loss before tax is \u00a31.3 million (2021: loss of \u00a33.0 million)\n.\nTaxation\nThe utilisation of tax losses and the benefit of the increase in the rate of corporation tax on the deferred tax asset has resulted in a tax credit for the year of \u00a30.8 million (2021: \u00a31.2 million).\nLoss on continuing operations\nWhilst the underlying trading performance of Manage shows significant positive EBITDA, group costs, finance costs and impairment charges on the software licences result in a loss after tax for the year on continuing operations of \u00a30.6 million (2021: loss on continuing operations \u00a31.8 million), which equates to a basic loss per share of 0.14 pence (2021: loss per share of pence 0.39).\nLoss on discontinued operations\nThe loss on discontinued operations of \u00a3nil million (2021: loss of \u00a30.2 million) arises on the disposal of the\nConnect Business on 19 October 2021, and from the operations in the period up to the date of disposal.\nStatement of Financial Position\nNon-current assets\nThe Group has property, plant and equipment of \u00a31.1 million (2021: \u00a30.8 million) all of which are subject to depreciation as per the policies set out in the accompanying financial statements. During the year there were additions of \u00a30.5 million (2021: \u00a30.03 million additions).\nIn 2020 we invested in software licences at the year-end amounting to \u00a31.8 million. These licences were purchased with a view to a planned expansion of the group, resale to our clients in our Connect Business and for operational use in the Connect Business and are payable in three tranches at the end of 2021, 2022 and 2023. The licences were capitalised as intangible assets at the present value of the payments, which are included within trade payables at 31 December 2021. Due to planned expansion which didn't materialise and the sale of the Connect Business in 2021, the Group is unable to obtain the full benefit of the licences in its remaining business. Accordingly, these software licenses were impaired and written down to \u00a3nil in 2021. They can no longer be utilised by the continuing operations and as such are deemed unlikely to be sold to the customers of the Connect Business, given its disposal in the prior year, or sold to third parties.\nFurther, intangible assets of customer contracts and related relationships are \u00a37.1 million (2021: \u00a38.2 million) and are subject to amortisation as per the policies set out in the accompanying financial statements.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade and other receivables have decreased to \u00a33.8 million from \u00a34.3 million.\nFollowing the disposal of the Connect Business in 2021, working capital management has improved as the underlying nature of the Managed Business has a reduced number of customers; all of them are larger corporates with good credit ratings and regular payment cycles.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables amounted to \u00a34.5 million (2021: \u00a36.0 million), including trade payables of \u00a32.7 million (2021: \u00a33.8 million) taxation and social security of \u00a30.8 million (2021: \u00a30.8 million) and accruals of \u00a31.0 million (2021: \u00a31.4 million).\nContract liabilities arise from customers being invoiced in advance of services delivered, in accordance with individual contractual terms, at the balance sheet date this amounted to \u00a30.05 million (2021: \u00a30.05 million). Contract liabilities remain materially unchanged year on year.\nFollowing the disposal of the Connect Business, the number of suppliers has been reduced and allows for better supplier management leading to improved working capital.\nCashflow and net debt\nNet cash generated from operating activities during the year was \u00a31.5 million (2021 \u00a30.6 million generated). Our Manage business continues to be cash generative and has developed excellent relationships with key strategic partners. The Group\ninvested \u00a30.2 million (2021: \u00a30.03 million) in fixed assets. There were no new loans in 2022 (2021: \u00a31.0 million net), but repayment of lease liabilities consumed \u00a30.3 million (2021: \u00a30.4 million) of cash. The result is that as at 31 December 2022 there were no bank borrowings or overdraft debt and the cash balance was \u00a30.4 million\n(\n2021: \u00a30.3 million).\nBorrowings\nOn 11 May 2021 \u00a32,397,519 of the unsecured convertible loan notes issued in August 2018 were converted into 95,900,760 Ordinary shares of 2.5p each, at a conversion price of 2.5p per share.\nThe Nimoveri Loan Notes issued on 1st June 2020 (\u00a3100,000) were redeemable on 31 December 2021. On 13 December 2021 both parties agreed the Nimoveri Loan Notes would be repaid in four equal monthly instalments commencing 31 January 2022.\nThe Company issued a loan note net of expenses for proceeds of \u00a31.0 million in November 2022, which if not repaid by 31 March 2022 increases to \u00a31.1875m and incurs interest of 20.4 % per annum, repayable on 23 December 2025. The loan note was not repaid by 31 March 2022.\nOn 2 November 2022 the members meeting at the Annual General Meeting, and then at the General Meeting that followed, voted to convert \u00a315.5 million of loan notes (including fees and interest) into share capital. Details of the capital reorganisation and consolidation are set out in Note 27.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the convertible loan notes liability in the balance sheet was \u00a3143,480 (2021: \u00a3130,437), and the secured loan notes liability was \u00a33,489,991 (\u00a32021: \u00a317,027,016).\nDividend\nThe Directors do not propose a dividend in respect of the current financial year (2021: \u00a3nil).\nDonations to charities\nThe Directors paid \u00a333 to The Prince's Trust as part of the Company capital reorganisation as set out in Note 27 (2021: \u00a3nil).\nUpdate and outlook for 2023\nSet out within the Chairman's Statement are details of the current trading performance and outlook. Trading in the first four months of 2023 has been strong, including very positive further contract wins from our key partner.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have produced detailed trading and cashflow forecasts. In reaching their conclusion on the going concern basis of accounting, the Directors note and rely on the improved trading performance, the positive cash generation that the business is now experiencing and the current signed order book. A reverse stress test of the model has been run to determine at what level of shortfall in revenues the Group would run out of cash. Given the committed orders already obtained and the visibility of future revenues, the directors do not consider it likely that revenues could drop to such an extent that the Group would run out of cash. They have also considered the impact of any delayed customer payments and have developed plans to mitigate any such delays to ensure that the Group can continue to settle its liabilities as they fall due and operate as a going concern. The Directors therefore have an expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources available to them to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. Accordingly, the Group and Company continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\nStrategic Report\nReview\nof\nthe\nBusiness\nA detailed review of the business is set out in the Chairman's Statement and the Financial Review. The year under review was\na\npositive one for the business with continuing revenues remaining consistent year-on-year and Adjusted EBITDA* remaining positive, although the Group reported a post-tax loss due to finance costs, impairments and restructuring. Future developments and current trading and prospects are set out in the Chairman's Statement and the Financial Review. These reports together with the Corporate Governance Statement are incorporated into this\nStrategic Report by reference and should be read as part of this report. The Group's strategy is focused on maximising value for stakeholders by increasing revenues and profits by upselling to our current customer base as well as by bringing new customers on board.\nAt 31 December 2022, the Board comprised two Directors (2021: two) all of which were male. At 31 December 2022 the Group had 196 employees including Directors (2021: 165) of which 164 were male (2021:134) and 36 were female (2021:31).\n* Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment charges, non-underlying items, loss on disposal of fixed assets and share-based payments.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nIdentifying, evaluating, and managing the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is an integral part of the way the Group\ndoes\nbusiness.\nThere\nare\npolicies\nand\nprocedures\nin\nplace\nthroughout\nthe\noperations,\nembedded within our management structure and as part of our normal operating processes.\nThe\nBoard\nreviews\nthe\nprincipal\nrisks\non\na\nbi-annual\nbasis.\nThe risks have been amended following the sale of the Connect Business with the resultant Group being greatly simplified. The impact, measures in\nplace\nand\ntactics\nto mitigate risks are assessed\non\na\nregular\nbasis.\nThe\nrisk\ncategories,\nset\nout\nbelow,\nhave\nbeen\nidentified\nby the Board as those currently considered to potentially have the most material impact on the Group's future performance. In addition to these risks, note 24 contains details of financial risks.\nCustomer concentration\nThe Group has a significant revenue concentration with a single Partner (84%). This is mitigated as there are a number of end customers, all with different agreements and contract end dates. The Group has traded with the Partner for over 20 years and has long standing relationships. The Group is also focused on reducing this concentration and is working on several opportunities to achieve this.\nMarket and Economic Conditions\nMarket and economic conditions are recognised as one of the principal risks in the current trading environment. Risk is mitigated\nby\nthe monitoring of trading conditions and changes in government legislation, the development of action plans to address specific legislative changes and the constant search for ways to achieve new efficiencies in the business without impacting service levels.\nThe Board does not believe the current macro-economic outlook has changed the Group's prospects given the large proportion of the end-customers being in the public sector. The Group has also undertaken stress testing of the detailed trading forecasts and cashflows taking into account inflation and interest rate increases. The Board does not consider that these will change the outlook at present. In relation to interest rates increases, the Group's debt is at a fixed rate.\nReliance on Key Personnel and Management\nThe success of the Group is dependent on the services of key management and operating personnel. The Directors believe that the Group's future success will be largely dependent on its ability to retain and attract highly skilled and qualified personnel and to train and manage its employee base. During the year, the restructuring programme continued which resulted in more members of staff being made redundant and other members of staff moving into new roles. For those who remain there are several employee benefits and active communication is encouraged within the business to mitigate the risk of losing skilled and qualified individuals. Furthermore, there is an apprenticeship scheme which the Group believes will assist in training and retaining younger individuals going forward.\nCompetition\nThe Group operates in a highly competitive marketplace and while the Directors believe the Group enjoys certain strengths and advantages in competing for business, some competitors are much larger with considerable scale. The Group monitors\ncompetitors'\nactivity\nand\nconstantly\nreviews\nits\nown\nservices\nand\nprices\nto\nensure\na\ncompetitive\nposition\nin the market is maintained.\nTechnology\nThe market for our services is in a state of constant innovation and change. We devote significant resource to the development of new service lines, ensuring new technologies can be incorporated and integrated with the Group's core services. The nature of the Group's services means that they are exposed to a range of technological risks, such as viruses, hacking and an ever-changing spectrum of security risk. We maintain constant pro-active vigilance against such risks and the Group maintains membership of some of the highest levels of security accreditation as part of the service it offers its customers.\ns.172(1) Companies Act 2006: Statement of Directors' Duties to Stakeholders\nPromoting the success of the Company\nThe Directors are aware of their duty under section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole and, in doing so, to have regard (amongst other matters) to:\n\u00b7\nThe likely consequences of any decision in the long term;\n\u00b7\nThe interests of the Company's employees;\n\u00b7\nThe need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;\n\u00b7\nThe impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment;\n\u00b7\nThe desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and\n\u00b7\nThe need to act fairly between members of the Company.\nThe Board recognises that the long-term success of the Company requires positive interaction with its stakeholders. Positive engagement with stakeholders will enable our stakeholders to better understand the activities, needs and challenges of the business and enable the Board to better understand and address relevant stakeholder views which will assist the Board in its decision making and to discharge its duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.\nOur Commitment\nThe Company is committed to operating with an inclusive, transparent, and respectful culture and places particular emphasis on operating to the highest ethical and environmental standards.\nThe Directors take personal ownership of the policies and maintenance of the necessary exacting standards of business conduct throughout the organisation and for delivering these corporate and social responsibilities.\nStakeholder Engagement\nRecruitment and employee management are undertaken in line with the Company Employment Policy which has committed to a working environment with equal opportunities for all, without discrimination and regardless of sex, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or disability.\nWe are committed to being an equal opportunities employer and oppose all forms of unlawful discrimination. We believe that staff members should be treated on their merits and that employment-related decisions should be based on objective job-related criteria such as aptitude and skills. For these reasons, all staff members, and particularly managers with responsibility for employment-related decisions, must comply with the practices described below.\n\u2022 recruitment;\u2022 pay and benefits;\u2022 promotion and training;\u2022 disciplinary, performance improvement and redundancy procedures.\nAs part of the induction of all employees and on a recurring annual basis, all employees have to complete a mandatory set of training courses, one of which is on equality, diversity and inclusion in both the workplace and local communities.\nWe conduct a gender pay analysis annually and the report is published on the Company's website.\nTialis seeks to attract and retain staff by acting as a responsible employer. The health, safety and well-being of employees is important to the Company. On the sale of Connect, we engaged with the acquirer and supported all the employees through the transition. All employees had access and were encouraged to use the Employee Assistance Program with a 24-hour helpline.\nFurthermore, the Company has committed to continuous development schemes and will support employees to attain the best for themselves and the Company through personal assessment, training and mentoring.\nExternally, Tialis has established long-term partnerships that complement its in-house expertise and has built a network of specialised partners within the industry and beyond.\nThe Directors have committed to promoting a company culture that treats everyone fairly and with respect and this commitment extends to all principal stakeholders including shareholders, employees, consultants, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it is active.\nAll Directors are encouraged to act in a way they consider, in good faith, to be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders. In doing so, they each have regard to a range of matters when making decisions for the long-term success of the Company.\nHealth and Safety\nTialis Group cares profoundly about the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities who could be affected by our activities and aims to protect them from any foreseeable hazard or danger arising from our activities. To this end in 2022 the Company completed a series of safety related studies and reviews, including electrical and gas, quantified risk assessments and layer of protection analysis using external experts to review the product risk and the application on our Dartford site. In all instances the findings of the safety risk assessments have demonstrated that the risk arising from the Tialis Group's activities is well within acceptable tolerable risk levels. In 2023 the Company will revisit these assessments to identify any changes that have been introduced which may represent new or variants of risk.\nWe have a Health and safety policy and as mentioned above all employees have to complete a mandatory set of training courses, which include several health and safety courses, including manual handling, mental health awareness, stress awareness, bullying and harassment, display screen set-up and a general health and safety course.\nDuring 2022 the Board was particularly mindful of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when making decisions. This has impacted all areas of decision making and is not limited to ensuring that its impact on employees, contractors, suppliers and the communities in which Tialis Group operates is factored into any decision, but also to ensure that its reputational, financial and other impact is also considered.\nThe Directors recognise that the key to successful health and safety management requires an effective policy, organisation, and arrangements which reflect the commitment of senior management. The executive management team implement the Company's health and safety policy and ensure that the Company Health and Safety (HSE) management system and safety standards are all maintained, monitored, and improved where necessary. During the COVID-19 pandemic and currently, the level of cleaning was improved and a high level of cleanliness is maintained.\nThe Company's activities at its Dartford site were delivered HSE incident free in 2022.\nEnvironmental Policies\nThe Company's Environmental Policy recognises the importance of our technology from a global challenge perspective. The Company will regularly evaluate the environmental impact of its activities, products, and services, taking all actions necessary to continually improve the Company's and its products' environmental performance.\nAt present, we are working towards achieving ISO-14001 certification and are undergoing a third-party gap analysis prior to the certification audit.\nTialis Group has a Carbon Reduction Strategy which is published on the company website. We at Tialis Group are committed to reducing our impact on the environment in order to help safeguard our planet for future generations. We have committed to a well-below 2 degrees Celsius trajectory and to maintaining our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions at a level 30% lower than in our base year of 2018. We are also investing in an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 to ensure that we can monitor and manage our activities to meet our targets.\nIn addition to committing to maintaining our scope 1 and 2 emissions at 30% less than they were in 2018, we will also work to reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2.5% every year from a 2022 baseline. We have engaged with Science Based Targets (SBTi) to validate our 30% reduction target. SBTi has confirmed that our target of a 30% reduction from 2018 has been accepted and will be published on their website. They have undertaken due diligence on the 2018 information we provided and verified its accuracy. As the work we have done in the last few years has helped us achieve the 30% target already, we will now ensure that we maintain this lower level.\nAs mentioned above, all employees have to complete a mandatory set of training courses, which include an environmental awareness course.\nStrategy\nThe market for IT managed services in the United Kingdom is highly fragmented and is served by a broad spectrum of businesses from global telecommunication companies through hardware and software providers, system integrators and a range of independent managed service providers of varying sizes through to companies providing individual elements of the IT managed services spectrum. The market is growing, driven by the continued move towards off-premise solutions and mobile access to secure services.\nDespite the continued challenges we met in 2022, the Board believes that the Group's position between the very large system integrators and the smaller competitors that may lack delivery structure, reputation, reliability, and financial strength remains a very compelling one.\nWe have developed a delivery model that provides assurance and certainty for customers. This underlying platform is the core strength of the Group and we will continue to consider augmenting underlying organic growth in the Manage business in 2022 with acquisitions to leverage this platform should there be a compelling strategic and financial case.\nThe decision to dispose of Connect allows us to focus on the core business, as part of this decision-making process which should result in the medium to longer term the Group returning to sustained profits. Through our long standing customer relationships, we have demonstrated a commitment to service quality for over twenty years.\nOn behalf of the Board\nAndy Parker\nExecutive Chairman\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\nYear ended\nYear ended\n31 December\n31 December\nNote\n2022\n2021\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nContinuing operations\nRevenue\n3\n14,463\n14,456\nCost of sales\n5\n(9,408)\n(8,185)\nGross profit\n5,055\n6,271\nOther operating income\n4\n-\n40\nAdministrative expenses excluding impairment\n5\n(4,011)\n(5,151)\nImpairment charge on intangibles\n15\n-\n(1,833)\nImpairment credit on trade receivables\n-\n139\nTotal administrative expenses\n(4,011)\n(6,845)\nAdjusted EBITDA*\n1,950\n3,099\nNon underlying items\n7\n(421)\n(433)\nDepreciation\n14\n(208)\n(321)\nAmortisation\n15\n(1,169)\n(1,169)\nGain on the conversion of secured loan notes\n892\n-\nImpairment charge on intangibles\n15\n-\n(1,833)\nImpairment credit on trade receivables\n17\n-\n139\nCharges for share-based payments\n28\n-\n(16)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n1,044\n(534)\nFinance income\n9\n10\n-\nFinance costs\n10\n(2,334)\n(2,453)\nLoss on ordinary activities before taxation\n(1,280\n)\n(2,987)\nIncome tax\n12\n843\n1,204\nLoss for the year from continuing operations\n(437)\n(1,783)\nDerecognition of foreign currency reserve\n(150)\n-\nLoss for the year from discontinued operations\n8\n-\n(193)\nLoss for the year and total comprehensive loss attributable to owners of the parent company\n(587)\n(1,976)\nFrom continuing operations\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n13\n(0.10) p\n(0.39) p\nFrom discontinued operations\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n13\n(0.04)p\n(0.04) p\nTotal basic and diluted loss per share\n13\n(0.14) p\n(0.43) p\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment charge, non-underlying items, loss on disposal of fixed assets and share-based payments.\nThe notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nStatements of Financial Position\nAs at 31 December 2022\nNote\nGroup\nCompany\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment\n14\n1,076\n813\n-\n-\nIntangible assets\n15\n7,062\n8,231\n-\n-\nInvestments\n16\n-\n-\n18,211\n7,877\nDeferred tax asset\n12\n3,108\n2,265\n-\n-\nTrade and other receivables\n17\n100\n313\n9\n16,842\n11,346\n11,622\n18,220\n24,719\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n17\n3,661\n3,969\n79\n31\nCash and cash equivalents\n18\n414\n349\n3\n2\n4,075\n4,318\n82\n33\nTotal assets\n15,421\n15,940\n18,302\n24,752\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n19\n4,544\n5,318\n778\n2,445\nContract liabilities\n20\n51\n49\n-\n-\nBorrowings\n22\n210\n246\n-\n-\nProvisions\n21\n-\n157\n-\n-\n4,805\n5,770\n778\n2,445\nNon-current liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n19\n-\n730\n-\n-\nBorrowings\n22\n4,255\n17,737\n3,490\n17,027\nConvertible loan notes\n23\n143\n131\n143\n131\nProvisions\n21\n245\n202\n-\n-\n4,643\n18,800\n3,633\n17,158\nTotal liabilities\n9,448\n24,570\n4,411\n19,603\nNet (liabilities)/assets\n5,973\n(8,630)\n13,891\n5,149\nEquity attributable to equity holders of the parent\nShare capital\n27\n12,586\n12,418\n12,586\n12,418\nShare premium\n50,754\n35,882\n50,754\n35,882\nEquity reserve\n58\n58\n58\n58\nRetained earnings\n(57,425)\n(56,838)\n(49,507)\n(43,209)\nForeign currency translation reserve\n-\n(150)\n-\n-\nTotal equity\n5,973\n(8,630)\n13,891\n5,149\nThe notes are an integral part of these financial statements.

The registered office\nis 24 Dublin Street, Edinburgh EH1 3PP and the principal place of business is in the United Kingdom.\nThe principal activity of the Group is the provision of network, cloud and IT managed services.\nThe principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company financial statements throughout the year and all by subsidiary companies are set out below.\n1.1\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated and parent company financial statements of Tialis Group have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 to not present the parent Company's Income Statement.\nThe accounting framework requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 1.25 in the accounting policies. The financial statements are prepared in GBP (being the functional currency of the Group) and rounded to the nearest \u00a31,000.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have produced detailed trading and cashflow forecasts. In reaching their conclusion on the going concern basis of accounting, the Directors note and rely on the improved trading performance, the positive cash generation that the business is now experiencing and the current signed order book. A reverse stress test of the model has been run to determine at what level of shortfall in revenues the Group would run out of cash. Given the committed orders already obtained and the visibility of future revenues, the directors do not consider it likely that revenues could drop to such an extent that the Group would run out of cash. They have also considered the impact of any delayed customer payments and have developed plans to mitigate any such delays to ensure that the group can continue to settle its liabilities as they fall due and operate as a going concern. The directors therefore have an expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources available to them to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. Accordingly, the Group and Company continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n1.2\nBasis of consolidation\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\nThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the total of the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\nAcquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.\n1.3\nInvestments\nInvestments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses. A formal assessment of the recoverability of the investment values is undertaken on an annual basis by the Directors. Where indicators of impairment are identified, fixed asset investments are impaired accordingly.\n1.4\nIntangible assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any non- controlling interest over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement as a bargain purchase.\nFollowing initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to a cash generating unit.\nGoodwill\nimpairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.\nOther intangible assets arising from business combinations\nIntangible assets that meet the criteria to be separately recognised as part of a business combination are carried at cost (which is equal to their fair value at the date of acquisition) less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired in this manner include trademarks and customer contracts. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:\n\u00b7\nCustomer contracts and related relationships 13 years\n\u00b7\nTrademarks 5 years\nImpairment and amortisation charges are included within the administrative expenses line in the income statement.\nTechnology development\nExpenditure on internally developed technology is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:\n-\nit is technically feasible to develop the technology for it to be used or sold\n-\nadequate resources are available to complete the development\n-\nthere is an intention to complete and for the Group to use or sell the technology\n-\nuse or sale of the asset will generate future economic benefits, and\n-\nexpenditure on the project can be measured reliably.\nCapitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from using or selling the assets developed. The amortisation expense is included within the administrative expenses line in the income statement. Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred.\nSoftware and licensing\nSeparately acquired software and licenses are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\nThey are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:\n\u00b7\nSoftware and licensing 8 years\n1.5\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. The cost includes the original price of the asset and the cost attributable to bringing the asset to its current working condition for its intended use.\nDepreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is reviewed on an annual basis, as follows:\n\u00b7\nLeasehold property Over remaining lease term\n\u00b7\nNetwork infrastructure 3 - 10 years\n\u00b7\nEquipment, fixtures and fittings 3 - 5 years\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item is de-recognised.\nRight-of-use assets\nA right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n1.6\nImpairment of assets\nGoodwill is not subject to amortisation and is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each\nof\nthe\ncash\ngenerating\nunits\nexpected\nto\nbenefit\nfrom\nthe\nbusiness\ncombination's\nsynergies.\nImpairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised.\nOther intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to amortisation and depreciation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.\nThe recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined by the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Fair value less costs to sell is, where known, based on actual sales price net of costs incurred in completing the disposal. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, that were impaired in previous periods are reviewed annually to assess whether the impairment is still relevant.\n1.7\nShare capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from proceeds.\n1.8\nLeases\nA lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate\ncannot\nbe\nreadily\ndetermined,\nthe Group's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\nLease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.\n1.9\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event where it\nis\nprobable\nthat\nan\noutflow\nof\nresources\nembodying\neconomic\nbenefits\nwill\nbe\nrequired\nto\nsettle\nthe\nobligation\nand a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n1.10\nCurrent and deferred income tax\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred income tax is provided for on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, with the following exceptions:\n\u00b7\nwhere the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither affects accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n\u00b7\nin respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n\u00b7\ndeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.\n1.11\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade\nreceivables,\nwhich\nprincipally\nrepresent\namounts\ndue\nfrom\ncustomers,\nare\nrecognised\nat\namortised\ncost\nas\nthey\nmeet\nthe\nIFRS\n9\nclassification\ntest\nof\nbeing\nheld\nto\ncollect,\nand\nthe\ncash\nflow\ncharacteristics\nrepresent\nsolely payments of principal and interest.\nThe Group has applied the Simplified Approach applying a provision matrix based on number of days past due to measure lifetime expected credit losses and after taking into account customers with different credit risk profiles and current and forecast trading conditions.\nTrade receivables are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company.\nThe Group's trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing.\n1.12\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.\nFor the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.\n1.13\nForeign currencies\nThe presentational currency of the Group is Pound Sterling (\u00a3) and the Group conducts the majority of its business in Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the presentational currency by applying the rate of exchange ruling at\nthe\ndate\nof\nthe\ntransaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the presentational currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement.\n1.14\nAccrual for employee benefits, including holiday pay\nProvision is made for employee benefits, including holiday pay, to the extent of the liability as if all employees of the Group had left the business at its reporting date.\n1.15\nFinancial assets and liabilities\nThe Group's financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise cash, borrowings, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables. These are accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting policy note.\nTrade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their amortised cost.\n1.16\nConvertible loan notes\nThe component parts of convertible loans issued by the Company are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability portion of convertible loan notes is determined using a market interest rate for a comparable loan note with no conversion option. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until the loan notes are redeemed or converted either during or at the end of the term of the convertible loan notes. The remainder of the carrying amount of the loan notes is allocated to the conversion option and shown within equity and\nis\nnot\nsubsequently\nremeasured.\nWhen the conversion option remains unexercised at the maturity date of the convertible note, the balance recognised in equity will be transferred to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement upon conversion or expiration of the conversion options.\n1.17\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in the finance cost line in the income statement.\n1.18\nFinance costs\nLoans are carried at fair value on initial recognition, net of unamortised issue costs of debt. These costs are amortised over the loan term.\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis, using the effective rate method.\n1.19\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group's activities. Revenue is shown net of Valued Added Tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after the elimination of sales within the Group.\nThe Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits\nwill flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group's activities as described below.\nRecurring revenue\nThe largest portion of the Group's revenues relates to a number of network, cloud and IT managed services, which the Group offers to its customers. All of the revenue in this category is contracted and includes a full range of support, maintenance, subscription and service agreements. Revenue for these types of services is recognised as the services are provided on the basis that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance of the services over the contract term. In terms of performance obligations, the customer can benefit from each service on its own and the Group's promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The transaction price for each service is allocated to each performance obligation. The costs incurred for these revenue streams typically match the\nrevenue pattern. A contract liability is recognised when billing occurs\nahead of revenue recognition. A contract asset is recognised when the revenue recognition criteria were met but in accordance with the underlying contract, the sales invoice has not been issued yet.\nProject revenue\nThese project services include mainly installation and consultancy services. Performance obligations are met once the hours or days have been worked. Revenue is therefore recognised over time based on the hours or days worked at the agreed price per\nhour\nor\nday.\nThe\ncosts\nincurred\nfor\nthis\nrevenue\nstream\ngenerally\nmatch\nthe revenue pattern, as a significant portion of consultancy costs relate to staff costs, which are recognised as incurred. Consultancy services are generally provided on a time and material basis.\n1.20\nGovernment Grants\nGrants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.\n1.21\nNon-underlying items\nIt is the policy of the Group to identify certain costs, which are material either because of their size or nature, separately on the face of the Income Statement in order that the underlying profitability of the business can be clearly understood. These costs are identified as non-underlying items, and comprise;\na)\nProfessional fees incurred in sourcing and completing acquisitions and disposals including legal expenses\nb)\nProfessional fees incurred in restructuring and refinancing acquisitions\nc)\nIntegration costs which are incurred by the Group when integrating one trading business into another, including rebranding of acquired businesses\nd)\nRedundancy costs, including employment related costs of staff made redundant up to the date of their leaving as a consequence of integration\ne)\nProperty costs such as lease termination penalties and vacant property provisions and third-party advisor fees\n1.22\nDiscontinued operations\nCash flows and operations that relate to a major component of the business that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale or distribution are shown separately from continuing operations.\n1.23\nSegmental reporting\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Executive Board. The Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews the Group's internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. For management reporting purposes and\noperationally,\nthe\ncontinuing\noperations\nof the Group consist of Tialis IT Essential Manage Limited for this year and the prior year.\n1.24\nStandards and interpretations not yet applied by the Group\nFor the purposes of the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has applied all standards and interpretations that are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. There was no significant impact of new standards and interpretations adopted in the year, which include:\n\u00b7\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and -FRS 16) - effective 1 Jan 2022\nNo new standards, amendments or interpretations to existing standards that have been published and that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, or later periods, have been adopted early. The new standards and interpretations are not expected to have any significant impact on the financial statements when applied.\n1.25\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nEstimates\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future, which by definition will seldom result in actual results that match the accounting estimate. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:\nRecoverability of deferred tax asset -\nThis in\ncludes estimates of the level of future profitability, and a judgement as to the likelihood of the group undergoing a restructure of its finances which would result in significant finance cost savings.\nA\nchange in the estimate of future profits would result in an equivalent change to the deferred tax asset recognised of 25% of the change in profits. There are no reasonably plausible scenarios which would result in the future profitability not being sufficient to enable full recovery of the tax losses in the assessment period.\nImpairment of intercompany balances\n-\nThe directors use estimates in assessing the level of impairment of intercompany balances at each period end, including the likely methods of recovery of the balances and future profitability of the underlying trade which would enable repayments to be made.\nJudgements\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management makes various judgements which can significantly affect the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Critical judgements are considered to be:\nClassification\nof\nnon-underlying items\n-\nthe\nDirectors\nhave\nexercised\njudgement\nwhen\nclassifying\ncertain costs arising during integration and strategic reorganisation projects. The Directors believe that these costs are all related to the types of costs described in 1.21 above and are appropriately classified.\nRecoverability of deferred tax asset -\nthe Directors have exercised judgement on the recoverability of tax losses attributable to future trading profits generated by the Group, and in doing so this has given rise to a deferred tax asset, details of which are shown in note 12 to the financial statements. The\njudgement involves assessing the extent to which trading losses can be offset against future profits.\nImpairment of software licences -\nAs set out in note 15, the directors performed an impairment review in respect of software licences in 2021, which had a carrying amount at the previous balance sheet date of \u00a31.8m. The impairment review was triggered both because the licences were not yet in use, and because of an indicator of impairment due to planned expansion which didn't materialise, and the sale of the Connect business, which meant the licences had no addressable market. Following the review the licences were fully impaired. The directors' judgement is that it is very unlikely that the benefit of trying to earn revenues for the licences would exceed the cost of funding the activities that would be required.\n2\nSegment reporting\nWith the sale of the Connect and Nimoveri Businesses in 2021 the Group has only one operating segment, the Manage Business.\n3\nRevenue\nDisaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers is as follows:\nYear ended 31 December 2022\nManaged\nProjects\nTotal\nservices\nGeographical regions\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nUnited Kingdom\n10,770\n3,632\n14,402\nEurope\n61\n-\n61\nTotal\n10,831\n3,632\n14,463\nTiming of revenue recognition\nGoods transferred at a point in time\n84\n-\n84\nServices transferred over time\n10,747\n3,632\n14,379\nTotal\n10,831\n3,632\n14,463\nThe revenue from the largest customer was \u00a311.7m (2021: \u00a36.8 million) or 84% of total revenue (2021: 63%).\nNo other customers account for more than 10% of revenue.\nYear ended 31 December 2021\nManaged\nProjects\nTotal\nServices\nGeographical regions\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nUnited Kingdom\n10,704\n3,716\n14,420\nEurope\n13\n23\n36\nTotal\n10,717\n3,739\n14,456\nTiming of revenue recognition\nGoods transferred at a point in time\n48\n-\n48\nServices transferred over time\n10,669\n3,739\n14,408\nTotal\n10,717\n3,739\n14,456\nContract balances\n2022\n2021\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nReceivables included within trade and other receivables\n2,499\n2,677\nContract assets\n664\n837\n3,163\n3,514\nContract liabilities\n(51)\n(49)\nTotal\n3,112\n3,465\nContract assets predominantly relate to fulfilled obligations in respect of projects and managed services which are billed monthly and in arrears.

Refunds are only due in the exceptional circumstances where the Group does not meet the performance obligations set out in a contract. The majority of revenue for services is invoiced monthly, sometimes quarterly, in advance, and goods are invoiced on delivery.\nUnsatisfied performance obligations\nAll contracts for the provision of services are for periods of one year or less or are billed based on resources utilised.

In assessing recoverability, management considers that the appropriate period over which profits can be assessed with a reasonable degree of certainty, and therefore used to offset the losses, is the period to 31 December 2029. The future taxable profits are assumed to include the impact of the planned conversion of borrowings to equity.\nThe evidence supporting the recognition of the deferred tax asset for losses is the partial use of losses in the year.\nThe Group had unrecognised trading losses carried forward at 31 December 2022 of \u00a33.1 million (2021: \u00a33.1 million). The Company has no deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2022 or 31 December 2021.\nThe Finance Bill 2022, which was substantively enacted on 24 May 2022, included the announcement that the corporation tax rate for years starting from April 2023 would increase to 25% on profits over \u00a3250,000 and that the rate for small profits under \u00a350,000 will remain at 19% and there will be a tapered rate for businesses with profits under \u00a3250,000 so that they pay less than the main rate. Deferred tax balances have been re-measured at the reporting date taking into account the new rate of tax.\n13\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share has been calculated using the loss after tax for the year for continuing operations of \u00a30.4 million (2021: Loss \u00a31.8 million), a loss after tax for the year for discontinued operations of \u00a30.2 million (2021 loss: \u00a30.2 million) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares of 418,575,630 (2021: 461,185,527). The weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating the basic and diluted measures is the same. This is because the outstanding warrants details of which are given in note 28, would have the effect of reducing the loss from continuing operations per ordinary share and therefore would be anti-dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.\nContinuing operations\n2022\n2021\nBasic and diluted loss per share (pence)\n(0.10)\np\n(0.39) p\nDiscontinued operations\nBasic and diluted loss per share (pence)\n(0.04)p\n(0.04) p\nTotal basic and diluted loss per share\n(0.14 )p\n(0.43) p\n14\nProperty, plant and equipment Group\nGroup\nLeasehold property\nNetwork infrastructure\nEquipment, fixtures, and fittings\nTotal\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nCost\nAt 1 January 2022\n1,549\n3,029\n337\n4,915\nAdditions\n272\n103\n116\n491\nDisposals\n-\n(2,970)\n(337)\n(3,307)\nAt 31 December 2022\n1,821\n162\n116\n2,099\nAccumulated depreciation\nAt 1 January 2022\n784\n2,990\n328\n4,102\nCharge for the year\n170\n28\n10\n208\nDisposals\n-\n(2,959)\n(328)\n(3,287)\nAt 31 December 2022\n954\n59\n10\n1,023\nNet carrying amount\n31 December 2022\n867\n103\n106\n1,076\n31 December 2021\n765\n39\n9\n813\nGroup\nLeasehold property\nNetwork infrastructure\nEquipment, fixtures, and fittings\nTotal\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nCost\nAt 1 January 2021\n2,181\n14,637\n3,726\n20,544\nDisposal of discontinued operations\n(632)\n(7,179)\n(2,279)\n(10,090)\nAcquisitions\n-\n-\n28\n28\nDisposals\n-\n(4,429)\n(1,138)\n(5,567)\nAt 31 December 2021\n1,549\n3,029\n337\n4,915\nAccumulated depreciation\nAt 1 January 2021\n1,144\n14,558\n3,634\n19,336\nDisposal of discontinued operations\n(632)\n(7,172)\n(2,269)\n(10,073)\nCharge for the year -

These licences were purchased with a view to a planned expansion of the group, resale to our clients in our Connect Business and for operational use in the Connect Business. Because the planned expansion didn't materialise and with the sale of the Connect Business in 2021, the directors believe that the Group would be unable to obtain the full benefit of the licences in its remaining business (see also note 1.25). The directors consider that the investment required to be able to sell the licences to third parties would exceed any potential benefit. Accordingly, these software licenses have been impaired and written down to \u00a3nil in 2021.\nCompany\nThe company had no intangible assets at 1 January 2021, 31 December 2021 or 31 December 2022.\n16\nInvestments Company\n2022\n\u00a3000\n2021\n\u00a3000\nAt 1 January 2021\n7,877\n7,877\nAdditions\n20,211\n-\nImpairment of investment in subsidiary companies\n(9,877)\n-\nAt 31 December\n18,211\n7,877\nThe Company has the following investments in subsidiaries:\nCountry of\nClass of\nOwnership\nIncorporation\nshares held\n2022\n2021\nHeld directly by Tialis Essential IT PLC\nIDE Group Limited\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nConnexions4London Limited3\nScotland\n2\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nSelection Services Investments Limited3\nScotland\n2\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nSelection Services Limited3\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nTialis Essential IT Financing Limited\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nHeld indirectly by Tialis Essential IT PLC\nTialis Essential IT Manage Limited\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nIDE Group Protect Limited3\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nIDE Group Subholdings Limited\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nIDE Group Voice Limited\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\nHoldfast Systems Limited3\nEngland\n1\nOrdinary\n100%\n100%\n1\nRegistered office is located at Unit 2, Quadrant Court, Crossways Business Park, Greenhithe, Dartford, England, DA9 9AY.\n2\nRegistered office is located at 24 Dublin Street, Edinburgh EH1 3PP.\n3\nIn solvent liquidation at the year-end 31 December 2022.\nAt 31 December, the\nonly\ntrading subsidiary of the Company was Tialis Essential IT Mana\nge Limited\n(31 December 2021:\nTialis Essential IT Manage Limited (formerly,\nIDE Group Manage Limited).\nAs part of the group restructuring in November 2022, the investment in Tialis Essential IT Financing Limited was transferred from IDE Group Limited to Tialis Essential IT PLC for \u00a320.2m.\nTialis Essential IT\nManage\nLimited's\nactivity\nconsists\nof\nIT\nManaged\nservices\n.\nAll of the remaining subsidiaries are non-trading.\nIDE Group Subholdings Limited, IDE Group Voice Limited, Tialis Essential IT Financing Limited, and IDE Group Limited, are exempt from the requirements of the Companies Act relating to the audit of individual accounts by virtue of Section 479A and the parent company has guaranteed all their liabilities at the reporting date.\n17\nTrade and other receivables\nGroup\nCompany\nCurrent\n2022\n\u00a3000\n2021\n\u00a3000\n2022\n\u00a3000\n2021\n\u00a3000\nTrade receivables\n2,499\n2,677\n-\n-\nLess provision for impairment of trade receivables\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTrade receivables - net\n2,499\n2,677\n-\n-\nContract assets\n664\n837\n-\n-\nPrepayments and other receivables\n498\n455\n2\n-\nTaxation and social security\n-\n-\n77\n31\n3,661\n3,969\n79\n31\nGroup\nCompany\nNon-current\n2022\n\u00a3000\n2021\n\u00a3000\n2022\n\u00a3000\n2021\n\u00a3000\nOther receivables\n100\n313\n-\n-\nAmounts due from subsidiary undertakings\n-\n-\n9\n65,575\nProvision against amounts due from subsidiary undertakings\n-\n-\n-\n(48,733)\n100\n313\n9\n16,842\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the Group reviews the amount of credit loss associated with its trade receivables, and contract assets.\nCustomer credit risk is managed according to strict credit control policies. The majority of the Group's revenues are derived from national or multi-national organisations with no prior history of default with the Group. There is low incidence of default in the top 50 customers. In respect of these customers credit risk is deemed lower on customers that contribute higher revenue due to an increased dependency on the group's services for business continuity, and because they are larger more secure businesses.\nThe Group has applied the Simplified Approach applying a provision matrix based on categorisation of the customer based on total revenue received by the group per annum to measure lifetime expected credit losses and after taking into account customers with different credit risk profiles and current and forecast trading conditions and the days past due. The historical loss rates will be adjusted to reflect current and forward\n-looking\ninformation on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of customers to settle the receivables.\nAt period end, customers were categorised into three categories based on spend in the last 12 months:\n1.\nTop 10\n2.\nTop 50\n3.\nOther\nImpairment was calculated based on the category the customer falls in to:\nCategory\nImpairment Rate\nCarrying amount\nCcr credit loss allowance\n(net of VAT)\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n%\n%\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nTop 10\n0\n0\n2,499\n2,677\n-\n-\nTop 50\n2\n2\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther\n5\n5\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSpecific\n100\n100\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,499\n2,677\n-\n-\nThe group is exposed to credit concentration risk with its largest customer comprising 82% (2021: 74%) of outstanding trade\nreceivables.\nSpecific provisions are also made based on known issues or changes in the lifetime expected credit loss. As at 31 December 2022, trade receivables of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil) were impaired and fully provided for.\nMovements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:\nGroup\n2022\n2021\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nAt 1 January\n-\n519\nIncrease in impairment provision\n-\n-\nProvision relating to discontinued operations\n-\n(317)\nWrite offs\n-\n(63)\nReleased during the year\n-\n(139)\nAt 31 December\n-\n-\n-\nThe creation and release of a provision for impaired receivables has been in the main included in \"administrative expenses\" in the Income Statement, with an amount being set against contract assets, \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil). The other asset classes within the Group's trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.\nAmounts due from subsidiary undertakings\nThe Company has funded the trading activities of its principal subsidiaries by way of inter-company loans. The amounts advanced do not have any specific terms relating to their repayment, are unsecured and are interest free. As all loans to subsidiaries are to be treated as due on demand, they fall within the scope of IFRS 9.\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the Company is required to make an assessment of expected credit losses. Having considered the quantum and probability of credit losses expected to arise, management concluded that no additional impairment charge was required for expected credit loss. There is no movement in the provision.\nThe calculation of the allowance for lifetime expected credit losses requires a significant degree of estimation and judgement, in particular in determining the probability weighted likely outcome for each scenario considered to determine the expected credit loss in each scenario. Should the assumptions in the business plan vary, this could have a significant impact on the carrying value of the intercompany loans in following periods.\nThe recoverability is sensitive to the probability of the achievement of future cash flows; however, given the trading projections and\nthe\nlevel\nof\nprovisions,\nthere\nis\ncurrently\nno\nreasonably\nplausible\nscenario\nin\nwhich\nthe provision would alter materially.

The effective interest rate for the Loan Notes has been calculated to be 18%.\nOn 1 June 2021 the Group completed the acquisition of Nimoveri Holdings Limited for \u00a3100,000 paid in cash on completion and the issue of \u00a3100,000 0% loan notes by\nIDE Group Limited, a Group company (the \"Nimoveri Loan Notes\").

The Nimoveri Loan Notes were fully repaid during the financial year ended 31 December 2022.\nThe Company issued a further loan note (\"Loan Note 2025\") net of expenses for proceeds of \u00a31m on 1 December 2021. The terms of the loan were that the rate of interest is 1.5% per month if repaid by 31 January 2022, 2.5% per month if repaid by 28 February 2022 and 3% per month if repaid by 31 March 2022.

The Group operates in the network and cloud hosting sector, which, from time-to-time requires substantial fixed asset investments, but the Group is financed predominately by equity.\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has previously both issued new shares, bank debt and bank facilities, and both unsecured and secured loan notes. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. As at 31 December 2022 the ratio was 2.3. Net debt as at 31 December 2022 is calculated as total bank borrowings, as at 31 December 2022 nil, and loan notes (including 'current and non-current borrowings' as shown in the consolidated balance sheet)\n,plus loans,\nless cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment charge, non-underlying items, (loss)/gain on disposal of fixed assets and share-based payments.\nThe loan note instrument under which the Secured Loan Notes were issued does not contain any covenants, however, the Group\ncontinues\nto\ncarefully\nmonitor\nits\ncapital\nposition.\nThe\nGroup\nadopts\na\nrisk-averse\nposition\nwith\nrespect\nto borrowings and maintains significant headroom to ensure that any unexpected situations do not create financial stress.\nThe Group has not proposed a dividend for the current or prior year.\n27\nCalled up share capital - Group and Company\nShares issued and fully paid\n2022\n2021\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n496,702,792 ordinary shares at 2.5p\n-\n12,418\n21,829,449 ordinary shares at 1p\n218\n-\n496,702,800 deferred shares at 2.49p\n12,368\n-\nShares issued and fully paid\n12,586\n12,418\nShares issued and fully paid\n2022\n2021\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nBeginning of the year\n12,418\n10,020\nIssued during 2021 on redemption of \u00a32,397,519 of convertible loan notes\n-\n2,398\nIssued during the year on conversion of secured loan notes (see below)\n167\n-\nIssued during the year in lieu of 2021 staff bonus (see below)\n1\n-\nShares issued and fully paid\n12,586\n12,418\nShare capital allotted, called up and fully paid\n2022\n2022\n2021\nNo. Ordinary Shares\nNo. Deferred Shares\nNo. Ordinary Shares\nBeginning of the year 496,702,792 shares at 2.5p\n496,702,792\n-\n400,802,032\nIssued during 2021 of 95,900,760 shares at 2.5p on redemption of convertible loan notes\n-\n-\n95,900,760\nIssue to the Company Secretary of 8 new shares at 2.5p\n8\n-\n-\nSub-division of 496,702,780 shares into a redenominated 0.01p share and a deferred share 2.49p\n-\n496,702,800\n-\nConsolidation of 496,702,800 redenominated 0.01p share to 4,967,028 shares at 1p\n(491,735,772)\n-\n-\nIssue of 16,758,421 shares at 1p on conversion of secured loan notes\n16,758,421\n-\n-\nIssue of 104,000 shares at 1p in lieu of 2021 staff bonus (first tranche of three tranches)\n104,000\n-\n-\nEnd of the year\n21,829,449\n496,702,800\n496,702,792\nThe par value of the shares new Ordinary shares is 1p and the Deferred shares is 2.49p (2021: old Ordinary shares 2.5p).\nThe holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.\nThe holders of Deferred shares are not entitled to receive dividends, nor are they entitled to vote.

The Board decided in the best interest of the Company was to aggregate the fractional shares and sell them in the market. The \u00a333 proceeds of the sale was donated to the Prince's Trust, a charity registered with the charities commission with Charity number 1079675 and which was selected by the Board in accordance with article 15 of the Company's Articles of Association.\nOn 2 November 2022 \u00a320,995,862 secured loan notes (including interest and fees), held by MXC at a rate equivalent to 70 pence in the pound, were converted into 16,476,574 new Ordinary shares of 1p at an assumed share price of \u00a30.892 per new ordinary share.

We will partner with early-stage organisations and visionary founders to accelerate innovation, scale intelligent solutions, and unlock long-term value.\nOur dual approach gives us a unique edge, bridging the gap between investment and execution. We work closely with companies in AI and automation to identify transformative opportunities, offering tailored guidance backed by real capital support. Whether streamlining operations, deploying intelligent systems, or scaling cutting-edge startups, we bring both the expertise and the resources to drive meaningful impact.\nBoth Andy Mills and Ian Smith have been involved in numerous successful start-ups and scale plays across the last 21 years together.\nAndy Mills said: \"We have a healthy pipeline of consulting and investing opportunities and are delighted to be working with Tialis to bring this new business to market, we see us scaling this business over the next five years to a considerable size\".\nThe creation of the Subsidiary requires an upfront investment of \u00a3250,000 that will be used to fund its first consulting project which will then immediately start generating revenue and be profitable from day one. This investment will be 50% funded by the Company and the remaining 50% funded by direct contributions of \u00a362,500 made into the Subsidiary by both Ian Smith, Executive Director of the Company, and Andy Mills, in exchange for 25% of the shares each in the Subsidiary. As non-corporate shareholders, both Ian and Andy will be entitled to a 10% per shareholder uncapped profit share on any capital gain in the underlying investment in the Subsidiary (the \"Profit Share\").\nThe Company will contribute \u00a3125,000 to the Subsidiary.\nIssue of Equity\nIn order to meet this contribution to the Subsidiary, the Company is conducting a direct subscription in the Company's ordinary shares at the mid-market closing price on 8 April 2025 of 60 pence per share (the \"Subscription Shares\"), which it will then pass on to the Subsidiary. In total the Company is issuing 208,333 Subscription Shares for cash for a total of approximately \u00a3125,000 (the \"Subscription\").\nThe subscribers to this fundraise will be Ian and Andy in equal proportion to each other at 50% each in return for their respective 25% holdings in the Subsidiary.\nRelated Party Transaction\nIan Smith by virtue of being a director and significant shareholder of the Company, is considered to be a related party of the Company.\nAs above, Ian has subscribed for\n104,166\nOrdinary Shares\nof 1p each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\")\nthrough his Self-Invested Personal Pension (\"SIPP\")\nat a price of\n60p\nper Ordinary Share.\nBoth Ian Smith's participation in the Profit Share and the Subscription constitute related party transactions for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies (together, the \"Related Party Transactions\").\nThe Directors of the Company (other than Ian Smith) consider, having consulted with Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, the Company's Nominated Adviser, that the terms of the Related Party Transactions are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nFollowing the above transactions, Mr Smith's beneficial interest in the Company is 647,166 Ordinary Shares, which represents 2.64% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital.\nIan is also the Chief Executive Officer and major shareholder of MXC Capital Limited (\"MXC\"). MXC's holding is 18,454,685 Ordinary Shares representing 75.22% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital. Ian and MXC hold in aggregate 19,101,851 Ordinary Shares, representing 77.86% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the admission 208,333 Subscription Shares to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the Subscription Shares will commence on or around\n14 April\n2025.\nThe subscription Shares will be issued fully paid and will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company in issue will be\n24,535,077\n. As the Company does not currently hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury, the total number of voting rights in the Company following Admission will be\n24,535,077\n.
