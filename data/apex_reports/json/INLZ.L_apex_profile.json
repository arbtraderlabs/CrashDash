The redemption value per ZDP Share is 201.4p on 10 April 2024.\nThe annual rate of return on the mid market price on 9 September 2022 of 173.5 pence is 9.87%.\nThe Cover Ratio as at 30 June 2022 has been calculated as follows:\nCover Ratio (Assets / Financial Indebtedness) 2.53 times\nCapital Entitlement, Assets, Financial Indebtedness and Cover Ratio have been determined as set out in the Circular to ZDP Shareholders published by Inland ZDP PLC on 19 July 2018, which is available at:\nhttp://www.inlandhomesplc.com/investors/inland-zdp/zdp-documents-and-accounts/\n.\nAs at 30 June 2022, Inland Homes plc, which has guaranteed the amounts due to ZDP Shareholders, had complied with all its covenants under the Loan Note, Contribution Agreement and related security documentation. ZDPCo has the benefit of first legal charges granted by members of the Inland Homes Group over specific pledged assets and pledged cash. There are no prior charges to any other Inland Group creditors in relation to the pledged assets or pledged cash.\nThe book value of the pledged assets is required to be more than 120% of the aggregate accrued amount due to ZDP Shareholders net of any pledged cash.\nThe book values used for the cover ratio and security covenant are based on historical cost less any impairment provisions. In practice, as work through the planning process progresses, the open market value of the sites increases above the book value. The uplift is measured on an EPRA basis in the annual and half year accounts, but has not been calculated as at 30 June 2022.\nZDP Share statistics\nZDP Share price as at 9 September 2022: 173.5p\nAnnual rate or return to maturity: 9.9%\nHurdle rate to recover ZDP Share price -44.8% per annum\nHurdle rate to Final Capital Entitlement -40.6% per annum\nThese hurdle rates are based on the unaudited book values in the Inland Homes PLC unaudited management accounts as at 30 June 2022.\nOn 6 September 2022 Inland Homes PLC announced provisions relating to the poor performance of the construction division (\u00a315.4m for the second half of the financial year). The Cover Ratio is based on the book value of Assets and Financial Indebtedness and reflects any write down of asset values; however it is not impacted by provisions for future trading losses or value enhancements arising from planning consents being obtained. The book value of certain receivables was written down by \u00a34.7 million after 30 June 2022. If this provision had been made before 30 June, the Cover Ratio would have been 2.49 times.\nEnquiries:\nInland ZDP PLC\nNishith Malde FCA Tel: 01494 762450\nDavid Floyd Tel: 01722 781142\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No.596/2014 as retained in UK law (MAR).

The inclusion of all the relevant tangible assets in the Assets, but the exclusion of most of the Inland Group's borrowings from the Financial Indebtedness is the reason for the high level of the Cover Ratio and the low level of the Gearing Ratio.\nAs at 31 March 2018, Inland Homes plc had complied with all its covenants under the Loan Note, Contribution Agreement and related security documentation, save that a charge over a pledged asset was released on 28 March 2018 (due to a transaction relating to the relevant property asset), creating a temporary shortfall as the replacement security, which had been approved by the board, had not been formally registered as at 31 March 2018. The replacement security has subsequently been registered within the time limits set out in the Loan Note. The Board of Inland ZDP PLC is pleased to confirm that Inland Homes plc is currently compliant with all its covenants under the Loan Note, Contribution Agreement and related security documentation.\nAs the redemption date of the ZDP shares on 10 April 2019 is now within a year, Inland Homes plc intends to consult major ZDP Shareholders in relation to refinancing options, which include the possibility of a rollover into new ZDP Shares or the deferral of the redemption date of the existing ZDP Shares (with an appropriate increase in the Final Capital Entitlement), certain possible changes to the terms of the Loan Note, Contribution Agreement and related security documentation and an opportunity for those ZDP Shareholders who wish to realise their investment in ZDP Shares to do so.\nEnquiries:\nInland ZDP PLC\nNishith Malde FCA Tel: 01494 762450\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nMSCLLFFSEFITIIT"

The Company's ordinary share capital is wholly owned by Inland Homes 2013 Limited which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Inland Homes plc ('Inland'), which has a principal activity of acquiring residential and mixed-use sites and seeking planning consent for development. Inland develops a number of the plots for private sale and sells consented plots to housebuilders.\nFollowing the publication of a prospectus on 14 December 2012 and issue of 8,500,000 ZDP shares at 100p per share there has been a series of further placings of new ZDP Shares in successive years resulting in there being 18,101,857 ZDP shares in issue as at 30 September 2020 (30 September 2019: 16,430,790 ZDP shares). 1,671,067 new ZDP shares were issued during the year ended 30 September 2020. The proceeds of the ZDP share issues totaling \u00a32.7m were lent to Inland Homes 2013 Limited for use in future investment opportunities.\nPursuant to a loan agreement between the Company and Inland, the Company has lent Inland the gross proceeds of its placings and all issue costs were borne by Inland to pursue future opportunities. This loan is on terms requiring its repayment by Inland to the Company on the ZDP shares repayment date when the Company must be wound up. The ZDP repayment date was initially 10 April 2019, but this was extended by five years to 10 April 2024 by the passing of resolutions at general and class meetings on 13 August 2018.\nKey performance indicators\nThe key performance indicators used by the board to measure the Company's success are the cover ratio (which is described in detail in the Chairman's statement), the accrued capital entitlement and the price of the ZDP shares.\n30 September 2020\n30\nSeptember\n2019\nAsset value per ZDP share\n167.30p\n159.42p\nAccrued capital entitlement per ZDP Share\nZDP share price\n166.81p\n156.00p\n159.12p\n161.50p\nThe asset value and the accrued capital entitlement will continue to increase as the repayment date approaches. The book value of ZDP Shares in the financial statements is derived from the various issue prices using the effective interest method, whereas the accrued capital entitlement is based on the initial issue price (100p) and its accrual over time to the redemption price and is not affected by the prices of subsequent issues. As at the repayment date, the book value and accrued capital entitlement will be equal to one another.\nUnder normal circumstances it is anticipated that the ZDP share price will be higher than the accrued entitlement as it will reflect the fixed nature of the return. The year-end share price had not recovered from the fall in markets in March 2020 caused by COVID-19. However, as the share price recovers from this fall, it is still expected that provided interest rates remain low, there will be a premium on the ZDP shares for as long as the return is higher than is generally available elsewhere. It is unlikely that the share price will exceed the ultimate repayment price of 201.4p which is due on 10 April 2024.\nObjective\nThe objective of the company is to make loans to Inland on terms which provide the final capital entitlement due to the holders of the ZDP shares at the repayment date of 10 April 2024.\nPrincipal risks and uncertainty and risk management\nThe Board believes that the principal risk faced by the Company is the credit risk associated with the loan made to Inland. The specific risks faced by Inland are included within its financial statements and comprise: the inability to source, acquire, promote and dispose of land; the increased complexity in the planning process and the adoption of the Community Infrastructure Levy; a severe fall in the housing market in the regions in which the group operates; inability to retain or source high calibre and experienced staff; significant upward changes in interest rates; unexpected contamination being found on a site; changes in legislation; cost overruns, material shortages and construction delays; and the availability of finance for land acquisition. The Directors of the Company are also directors of the ultimate parent company and are therefore in a position to assess the recoverability of amounts due by Inland.\nThe Company is also exposed to risks in relation to its financial instruments. Further details of these risks and the way in which they are managed are contained in note 9 of the financial statements.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nThe original loan and contribution agreements between the Company and Inland contain certain protections for the Company which are intended to benefit its ZDP shareholders. These include first charges over pledged assets and pledged cash in a charged bank account. The pledged assets (such as property and interests in property development joint ventures) must have a book value of at least 120% of the accrued value of the ZDP shares net of the pledged cash. As at 30 September 2020, the accrued amount due to ZDP shareholders was \u00a330,234,786 (30 June 2019: \u00a326,144,183), the pledged cash was \u00a37,702,396 (30 June 2019: \u00a37,020,000) and the pledged assets had a book value of \u00a332,861,848 (30 June 2019: \u00a338,772,990), thereby satisfying this requirement.\nThe loan agreement also contains a covenant relating to asset cover, which is shown below as at 30 September 2020. The definitions of Assets and Financial Indebtedness are set out in the prospectus published in connection with the issue of the ZDP shares which is available at\nhttp://www.inlandhomesplc.com/investors/inland-zdp/zdp-documents-and-accounts/\n. The definition of Financial Indebtedness excludes indebtedness which falls due more than 6 months after the final ZDP Repayment Date of 10 April 2024.\nAsset cover\n:\nAssets / Financial Indebtedness plus ZDP Final Redemption Liability = 2.2 times cover (30 September 2019: 2.0 times cover).\nThe asset cover should be at least 1.8 times, so this covenant, which is tested quarterly, was satisfied at 30 September 2020.\nThe board believes that the use of book values is generally conservative, because a substantial proportion of the group's assets are properties for which planning consents are sought. The planning process takes time and any progress towards reaching the stage when building can commence is not reflected in an increase in the book values beyond the costs attributable to the relevant sites, whereas any diminution in value is reflected by way of impairment provisions, such that planning gains are not generally recognised in Inland's financial statements until sales are contracted. If the covenant ratios were to be calculated by reference to the market values of the assets, the cover would be higher and the gearing lower.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected the Inland Homes plc group in a variety of ways as described in its annual report. The financing arrangements for the group are designed to spread loan and ZDP share maturities over time so that the risk of having to refinance an excessive amount when financial and credit markets are stressed is reduced. The funding comes from several sources, but with compatible terms and security arrangements, reducing the group's reliance on any single lender. Some of the group's financial commitments are at fixed rates and others (mainly revolving credit) are at floating rates of interest. This achieves a balance between deferring the impact of changes in interest rates and providing flexibility to draw down and repay some debt without early repayment penalties. The ZDP Shares benefit from the group's debt policies which mitigate and spread certain financing risks, and represent an important element of the Group's financing structure. ZDP Shareholders' ongoing support for the group is much appreciated by the Board.\nEnquiries:\nInland ZDP PLC\nNishith Malde FCA Tel: 01494 762450\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nYearended\n15-month period ended\n30 September 2020\n30 September\n2019\nContinuing operations\nNote\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRevenue\nInterest income\n2\n1,537\n1,523\nTotal income\n1,537\n1,523\nExpenditure\nExpenses\n3\n-\n-\nTotal expenditure\n-\n-\nProfit before finance costs and taxation\n1,537\n1,523\nFinance costs\n4\n(1,537)\n(1,523)\nProfit before tax\n-\nIncome tax\n5\n-\n-\nProfit for the year and total comprehensive income\n-\n-\nEarnings per share for profit attributable to the equity holders of the company during the year / period\n6\n0.0p\n0.0p\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n30 September 2020\n30\nSeptember\n2019\nNote\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nCurrent assets\nIntercompany receivable\n9,11\n30,285\n26,194\n30,285\n26,194\nNon-current liabilities\nZero Dividend Preference Shares\n7\n(30,235)\n(26,144)\n(30,235)\n(26,144)\nNet assets\n50\n50\nEquity\nOrdinary share capital\n8\n50\n50\nShareholders' funds\n50\n50\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nShare\ncapital\nTotal\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nAt 30 June 2018\n50\n50\nResult and total comprehensive income for the period\n-\n-\nAt 30 September 2019\n50\n50\nResult and total comprehensive income for the year\n-\n-\nAt 30 September 2020\n50\n50\nSTATEMENT OF CASHFLOWS\nYear\nended\n15-month period ended\n30 September 2020\n30 September 2019\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nCash flow from operating activities\nProfit for the year / period before tax\n-\n-\nAdjustments for:\n- interest expense\n1,537\n1,523\n- interest and similar income\n(1,537)\n(1,523)\nNet cash flow from operating activities\n-\n-\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n-\n-\nNet cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year / period\n-\n-\nNet cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year / period\n-\n-\nThe accompanying accounting policies and notes form and integral part of these financial statements.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1 Accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.\n1.1 Basis of preparation\nThe financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Company's financial statements is provided below.\nCertain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nThe Company's business activities principal risks and uncertainty, and risk management are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 and 2. The Company is reliant on the ability of Inland Homes Plc to continue as a going concern as detailed in the strategic report. Further disclosures regarding the Company's financial instruments and exposure to credit and liquidity risk are set out in note 9 of the Financial Statements.\nGiven the dependency on Inland Homes Plc, details regarding their going concern assumptions are given below.\nStandards in issue but not yet effective\n\u2022 Amendments to IFRS 9: Financial Instruments\n\u2022 Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015-2017 Cycle)\n\u2022 Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards*\n\u2022 IFRS 3 Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3);\n\u2022 IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8);\n\u2022 IFRS 9, IAS 38 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 38 and IFRS 7);\n\u2022 Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2018-2020 Cycle)*; and\n\u2022 IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Return Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16)*\n*Standards and amendments not yet endorsed by the EU.\nNone of the standards above are expected to have an impact on the Company's financial statements.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have reviewed the performance of the Group to which the Company is a member of for the current period and forecasts for the period to 28 February 2022. The going concern of the Company is dependent on that of the Group due to the use of intercompany debt across the Group to support the consolidated operations and therefore Going Concern has been considered at Group level.\nThe Directors have reviewed the performance of the Group and parent Company for the current year and forecasts for the period to 28 February 2022.\nThe Directors are required to assess the Group's and parent Company's abilities to continue as a going concern for a period of at least the next twelve months. Given the significant adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the economy and the activities of the Group, a thorough review of the going concern assumption has been undertaken in preparing the Group and parent Company financial statements.\nThe Group's and parent Company's going concern assessment considers the Group's and parent Company's principal risks and is dependent on several factors, including its financial performance, continued access to borrowing facilities and the ability to operate within their respective financial covenants.\nIn response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which quickly emerged in March 2020, the Group adopted stringent cash management procedures to conserve resources, a range of other measures undertaken to reduce the cost base and raised new equity of \u00a39.4m, net of expenses, to strengthen the balance sheet and provide additional liquidity during this uncertain period.\nIn preparing the forecasts the Directors have considered the continued adoption of stringent cash management procedures, market disruptions already brought about by COVID-19, the possibility of future disruption in the going concern period which could potentially be caused by COVID-19 and other risks and uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity risk, the present and possible future economic climate, the current and possible future demand for land with planning consent and the state of the housing market in the geographic areas where the Group operates. The key risks faced by the Group are set out on pages 36 to 38 of the Group's annual report.\nAt the date of signing of the Group and parent Company's accounts, the continued and prolonged impact of COVID-19 may result in further uncertainties that are not apparent at present. There are contractual and anticipated cash inflows expected which ensure that the Group and parent Company have sufficient working capital for its requirements.\nAt the date of signing of this report, the Group has a total forward order book of \u00a353.5m for private homes reserved or contracted, including two contracted block sales of 109 units and a contracted sale of a hotel and \u00a373.9m for partnership housing contract income. In addition, the Group has contracted to sell a parcel of land for \u00a314.0m (including payments for infrastructure works) subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.\nThe Group also has contracted annualised residential and commercial rental income of \u00a32.3m.\nAs also disclosed in Note 42 of the Group's Annual Report and Accounts, the Group extended the following facilities during January 2021:\n\u2022 A revolving credit facility for \u00a315.4m to 31 December 2021.\n\u2022 Two loan facilities amounting to \u00a311.0m to 31 December 2021.\n\u2022 Three bank loan facilities amounting to \u00a341.3m to 30 April 2022.\nThe Group has three facilities totalling \u00a326.4m falling due for repayment on 31 December 2021. The Directors are in advanced discussions with the provider of the revolving credit facility to renew the facility for a further five-year period. The Directors have positive relationships and have had constructive discussions with all their existing lenders and a number of other potential lenders; however, they do not as yet have a binding commitment to extend or refinance these facilities beyond 31 December 2021.\nThe Group has also negotiated a relaxation to the interest cover covenant test under the revolving credit facility with HSBC in respect of the December 2020 and March 2021 periods as proactive defence against any possible severe but plausible downside scenarios.\nThe Directors have performed detailed sensitivity analyses to test the Group's future liquidity and banking covenant compliance based on several scenarios. The Group has forecast land sales in the next twelve months in the normal course of its business.\nAs part of their Going Concern review, the Directors have considered the impact of a delay of six months on each of these sales in isolation. They have also considered, again in isolation, a price reduction of 10% on all residential unit sales that have not been contracted and are forecast to complete after 31 March 2021. Finally, the Group considered a delay in residential unit sales by three months. None of these scenarios leads to an issue with either the Group's debt covenants or its liquidity.\nThe Directors have also considered the following severe, but plausible downside scenario:\n\u2022 Only residential sales that have exchanged or reserved complete between now and 31 March. After 31 March through to 28 February 2022 legal completions of residential units continue, but at a 50% reduction in volume and a 10% reduction in sales prices\n\u2022 No land sales until the end of May 2021, other than a small scheduled sale where negotiations with the purchaser are in progress at the date of this report.\nAdditionally, the Directors considered an even more severe scenario which mirrors the above but assumes no residential unit sales for a period of three months from 1 April 2021 before returning to the assumptions in the Group's base case.\nThe Board's modelling choice of cessation of activity period for the severe, but plausible downside scenario is based on the market experiences of 2020, when the national housebuilders stopped purchasing land for a short period during national lockdown.\nIn making their assessment of the sensitivity tested above the Directors have considered the Stamp Duty Land Tax holiday which expires on 31 March 2021. The Directors are therefore confident that residential unit sales reserved or exchanged for completions due in the months of February 2021 and March 2021 are secure. The Directors have assumed that the current Stamp Duty Land Tax holiday window is not extended by the UK Government after 31 March 2021 in preparing their projections.\nUnder both severe, but plausible scenarios, the Directors would need to make strategic choices in the near term to delay both planning application activity, construction activity and identified but non-contractual purchases however there is no need for any further liquidity to be introduced into the Group or any need for any relaxation of the Group's financial covenants with its lenders. Should the cessation of the land and planning activity and housebuilding activity discussed above, extend beyond the periods referred to above, then the Group may have to rely on the sale of property assets at lower than open market values to generate liquidity for the Group and parent Company to meet their obligations as they fall contractually due. Again, there would be no need for any relaxation of the Group's financial covenants with its lenders under such circumstances.\nAdditionally, the Directors also have the option to access the capital and debt markets to raise further liquidity as may be needed.\nThe Strategy outlined above details our approach to the current situation but, the Directors are mindful that no one can forecast exactly how the global COVID-19 pandemic will play out and how this may affect the Group, industry and the wider economy for the foreseeable future. A significant worsening of the situation and a return to a strict national lockdown for a prolonged period longer than the severe, but plausible downside scenarios would have implications for the Group as it would for many other businesses. Such a situation would then require the Directors to re-examine the Group's financial position at the time and if necessary, report any significant adverse changes.\nAt the time of approving these financial statements and after making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and parent Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the Going Concern basis.\n1.2 Income\nIncome is recognised in revenue using the effective interest method on an accruals basis.\n1.3 Expenses\nAll expenses are borne by the Company's parent Company, Inland Homes 2013 Limited.\n1.4 Zero dividend preference shares\nZero dividend preference shares are recognised as liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position in accordance with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments. After initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost, which represents the initial proceeds of the issuance plus the accrued interest based on the effective interest method to 30 September 2020.\nWith the modification of the zero dividend preference shares, which occurred during the prior period, the revised terms were considered to constitute a substantial modification.\n1.5 Intercompany receivable\nIntercompany receivables are recognised as assets in the Statement of Financial Position in accordance with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments. After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost which represents the initial loan plus the accrued interest receivable at the reporting date. Directors have assessed intercompany receivables to meet the requirements under the business model test and SPPI test. The objective of the business model is to hold financial assets to collect their contractual cash flows. The cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding.\nThe Company applies the general approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9 for intercompany receivables. The expected credit loss provision in the current year and prior period have been assessed as \u00a3nil.\nPursuant to a loan agreement between the Company and Inland Homes plc, the Company has lent Inland Homes plc the gross proceeds of its placings. This loan is on terms requiring its repayment by Inland Homes plc to the Company on the ZDP shares repayment date when the company must be wound up however the loan made is repayable to Inland ZDP plc on demand and therefore classified as a current asset.\n1.6 Finance costs\nFinance costs are calculated as the difference between the proceeds on the issue of zero dividend preference shares and the final liability and are charged as finance costs over the term of the life of these shares using the effective interest method.\n1.7 Finance income\nFinance income is calculated on the amount lent to Inland Homes 2013 Limited and represents the difference between the amounts advanced (which was equal to the proceeds on the issue of zero dividend preference shares) and the final amounts due (which is equal to the liability payable on redemption of the zero dividend preference shares). It is recognised as revenue as interest income over the term of the zero dividend preference shares using the effective interest method.\n1.8 Taxation\nThe charge for taxation is based on the taxable profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expenses that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n1.9 Equity\nAn equity instrument is a contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities. Equity comprises 'Share capital', which represents the nominal value of equity shares.\n1.10 Key estimates and assumptions\nEstimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed reasonable. The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.\nJudgement is required in assessing the recoverability of the intercompany receivable. Recoverability is underpinned by the profitability of Inland's development and strategic land sites\n1.11 Segment information\nIn accordance with IFRS 8, information is disclosed to enable the users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which the Company engages. The board has identified that the sole operating segment is to provide the final capital entitlement of the Company's ZDP shares to the holders of the ZDP shares at the final repayment date of 10 April 2024. Consequently, all information presented in these financial statements relate to that segment.\n2 Interest Income\nYearended\n15-month period ended\n30 September 2020\n30 September 2019\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nInterest income from group undertakings\n1,537\n1,523\n3 Expenses\nAdministration expenses of \u00a3nil were suffered during the year (period ended 30 September 2019: \u00a3nil). All administration expenses during the year, including auditor's remuneration of \u00a325,000 (2019 \u00a320,000), were borne by the ultimate parent Company, Inland Homes plc. The directors received no remuneration for their services in relation to Inland ZDP PLC. Further disclosures with regards to the auditors' remuneration can be found in the group financial statements.\nThere were no employees other than directors in the current year or the prior year.\n4 Finance costs\nYearended\n15-month period ended\n30 September 2020\n30 September 2019\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nZDP share interest costs\n1,537\n1,523\n5 Taxation\nYearended\n15-month period ended\n30 September 2020\n30 September 2019\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nProfit before tax\n-\n-\nProfit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard\nrate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.00% (2019: 19.00%)\nZDP share interest costs disallowed\nGroup relief\n-\n292\n(292)\n-\n290\n(290)\nTax charge\n-\n-\n6 Earnings per ordinary share\nThe calculation of earnings per share is based on a profit after tax figure for the year of \u00a3nil (period ended 30 September 2019: \u00a3nil) and the weighted average number of 50,000 ordinary shares in issue during the year. The basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.\n7 Zero dividend preference shares\nAt 30 September\n2020\nAt 30 September\n2020\nAt 30\nSeptember\n2019\nAt 30\nSeptember\n2019\nNo.\n\u00a3000\nNo.\n\u00a3000\nZDP shares\nOpening ZDP shares\n16,430,790\n26,144\n12,444,200\n18,447\nIssued during the year/period\n1,671,067\n2,554\n3,986,590\n6,174\nZDP share interest cost\n-\n1,537\n-\n1,523\n18,101,857\n30,235\n16,430,790\n26,144\n8\nOrdinary share capital\nAuthorised/called up/allotted/fully paid\nAt 30 September\n2020\nAt 30 September\n2020\nAt 30 September\n2019\nAt 30 September\n2019\nNo.\n\u00a3000\nNo.\n\u00a3000\nOpening ordinary shares\n50,000\n50\n50,000\n50\nIssued during the year / period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n50,000 issued ordinary shares of \u00a31 each\n50,000\n50\n50,000\n50\nAll ordinary shares are owned by the Company's parent Company, Inland Homes 2013 Limited.\nEach ordinary share is entitled to one vote at a general meeting.\nIn addition to receiving any income distributed by way of dividend, the ordinary shareholders will be entitled to all surplus assets after payment of all debts, including the ZDP shares.\n9 Financial instruments\nThe Company's financial instruments comprise fixed interest creditors classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost and financial assets classified as amortised cost.\nThe main risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are liquidity risk and funding risk and credit risk.\nLiquidity and funding risk\nThis is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.\nLiquidity risk is considered to be significant as the Company is reliant upon repayment from its ultimate parent Company. The parent Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities. The parent Company aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping credit lines available.\nContractual maturity analysis for financial liabilities\nAt 30 September 2020\nAt 30 September 2019\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nZDP shares final redemption figure\nZDP shares final redemption figure\nLess than one year\n-\n-\nMore than one year and less than five years\n36,457\n33,092\nOver five years\n-\n-\n36,457\n33,092\nCredit risk\nThis is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered with the Company. Credit risk is managed by way of a security over the loan. The security relates to pledged tangible assets (such as property and interests in property development joint ventures) and pledged cash in a charged bank account.\nAt the reporting date, the Company's financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following:\nAmortised Cost\nAt 30 September 2020\nAt 30 September 2019\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nAmounts due from ultimate parent company\n30,285\n26,194\nThe directors consider the carrying amounts to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.\nThe Company applies the general approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9 for amounts due from ultimate parent Company. There were no expected credit loss provisions in the current year and prior period. The security that is pledged is more than sufficient to cover the amounts due. The Directors have assessed a possible downturn in the value of the pledged assets by 10% and following that assessment no credit loss, as defined by IFRS 9, would arise.\nThe following table presents the fair value of financial liabilities that are carried at amortised cost in the Statement of Financial Position in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in measuring the fair value of the financial liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical liabilities;\n\u00b7\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\n\u00b7\nLevel 3: inputs for the liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nThe level within which the financial liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair value measurement.\nIf the financial liabilities were measured at fair value in the Group Statement of Financial Position, they would be grouped into the fair value hierarchy as follows:\nThe level within which the financial liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair value measurement.\nLevel 1\n\u00a3000\nLevel 2\n\u00a3000\nLevel 3\n\u00a3000\nTotal\n\u00a3000\nNet fair value at 1 July 2018\n26,536\n-\n-\n26,536\nAdditions\n2,699\n-\n-\n2,699\nFair value movements during the year\n(996)\n-\n-\n(996)\nNet fair value at 30 September 2020\n28,239\n-\n-\n28,239\nLevel 1\n\u00a3000\nLevel 2\n\u00a3000\nLevel 3\n\u00a3000\nTotal\n\u00a3000\nNet fair value at 1 October 2019\n18,878\n-\n-\n18,878\nAdditions\n6,174\n-\n-\n6,174\nFair value movements during the year\n1,484\n-\n-\n1,484\nNet fair value at 30 September 2019\n26,536\n-\n-\n26,536\nThe ZDP shares are carried at their accrued value of 166.81p per share (30 September 2019: 159.12p) however their closing price on the main market of the London Stock Exchange on 30 September 2020 was 156.00p (30 September 2019: 161.50p).\nIn August 2018, the ZDP shareholders agreed to rollover and extend the facility and will now be repaid on or before 10 April 2024. This was accounted for as a substantial modification due to the significant extension in the term of the debt, the change to the covenants and the substantial change in interest rate. This resulted in no gain or loss being recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n10\nCapital management policies and procedures\nThe Company's objectives when managing capital are:\n\u00b7\nto safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern; and\n\u00b7\nto ensure sufficient liquid resources are available to meet the funding requirement of its ZDP shareholders.\nThe directors consider that the capital management policies and procedures of the ultimate parent company will enable the Company to meet its objectives. Further details of the policies and procedures of Inland Homes plc can be found within its financial statements and include a target capital to overall financing ratio of over 40%.\nThe capital of the Company comprises 1,860,186 (ordinary shares and ZDP preference shares) and the nominal value of these amounted to \u00a350,000 and \u00a31,810,186 respectively.\n11 Related party transactions\nThe loan to Inland Homes plc is repayable along with all accrued interest, together with a contribution for such amount that will result in the Company having sufficient cash funds to satisfy the then current, or as the case may be, final capital entitlement of the ZDP shares on the ZDP repayment date (see the Strategic Report on page 1) or immediately upon an event of default. At 30 September 2020, the total amount due from the ultimate parent Company was \u00a330,285,000 (30 September 2019: \u00a326,194,000).\n12 Ultimate controlling party\nThe directors regard Inland Homes Plc as the ultimate parent and controlling party.\n13 Holding Company\nThe Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Inland Homes 2013 Limited which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Inland Homes plc, a quoted Company whose shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. Copies of its accounts for the year ended 30 September 2020 will shortly be available to view on Inland's website (\nwww.inlandhomesplc.com\n)\n14 Responsibility and audit\nThe Directors are the persons responsible for the full annual report and financial statements.\nEach of the Directors confirms that to the best of his knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties it faces.\nThe statutory financial statements have been audited by BDO LLP and their report was unqualified.\n15 Publication of non-statutory accounts\nThe financial information for the year ended 30 September 2020 and the fifteen -month period ended 30 September 2019 in this announcement does not constitute the company's statutory accounts for those years.\nStatutory accounts for the fifteen-month period ended 30 September 2019 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The statutory accounts for the year ended 30 September 2020 will be delivered to the registrar of companies in due course.\nThe auditors' reports on the accounts for 30 September 2020 and 30 September 2019 were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis, and did not contain a statement under 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nA copy of the annual report will shortly be submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\nand at the Company's website: http://www.inlandhomesplc.com/investors/inland-zdp/zdp-documents-and-accounts/\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

IT IS NOT AN OFFER TO BUY, SUBSCRIBE OR ACQUIRE ANY SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH ANY SUCH OFFER OR SOLICITATION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL.\nPress release\nInland ZDP PLC\nIssue of 1,671,067 new ZDP Shares\nFor release on 7 November 2019\nIssue of ZDP Shares and use of proceeds\nThe Board of Inland ZDP PLC (\"\nZDPCo\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") is pleased to announce the issue of 1,671,067 new zero dividend preference shares of 10 pence each (\"\nZDP Shares\n\") at a price of 161.5 pence each (\"\nPlacing Price\n\"), subject to the admission of the ZDP Shares to listing on the Official List (by way of a standard listing under the Listing Rules) and to trading on London Stock Exchange plc's main market, for which applications have been made (the \"\nPlacing\n\"). Dealings in the ZDP Shares are expected to commence at 8.00 a.m. on 12 November 2019 (\"\nAdmission\n\").\nThe terms and conditions of the Placing are set out in the Appendix to this announcement.\nThe gross proceeds of the Placing are up to \u00a32.7 million which ZDPCo will lend to its ultimate holding company, Inland Homes PLC (\"\nInland Homes\n\"), pursuant to an interest-free secured loan note to be entered into between ZDPCo and Inland Homes on or shortly after Admission (\"\nNew Loan Note\n\"). The New Loan Note will be on the same terms as the loan note entered into between ZDPCo and Inland Homes on 20 December 2012 as amended on 13 August 2018.\nInland Homes will pay the costs of the Placing (estimated to be approximately \u00a373,475) out of its own resources and will apply the proceeds of the Placing to invest in inventories, property development joint ventures or settle liabilities to vendors of development sites.\nRights of ZDP Shares\nA ZDP Share is not an equity share and does not entitle the holder to any dividends, but it offers the holder a capital payment on a fixed date at a higher price than the initial subscription price, giving the holder a fixed return. The amount due to holders of ZDP Shares (\"\nZDP Shareholders\n\"), which accrues over time, is accounted for as a liability rather than as share capital. ZDP Shareholders will receive no dividends, but are entitled to receive 201.4 pence per ZDP Share on 10 April 2024, when ZDPCo will be wound up in accordance with the terms of the ZDP Shares and the articles of association of the Company. This equates to a gross redemption yield on the 161.5p Placing Price of 5.1 per cent. per annum.\nThe new ZDP Shares will be identical in all respects to the zero dividend preference shares of 10 pence each of ZDPCo in issue at the date of this announcement (\"\nExisting ZDP Shares\n\") and, therefore, will benefit from the same security arrangements as described in the\nprospectus published by ZDPCo on 14 December 2012 (the \"\nProspectus\n\") which were amended as described in the circular published by the Company on 19 July 2018, which are both available for download at\nhttp://www.inlandhomes.co.uk/inland-zdp-plc\n.\nIn summary, these security arrangements require that Inland Homes places the gross proceeds of the Placing in the Secured Account as Pledged Cash with first priority security over that account granted to ZDPCo. Amounts may be withdrawn by Inland Homes from the Secured Account to fund the business, and reduce the debt, of the Inland Group subject to first ranking security over Pledged Assets being granted in favour of ZDPCo with sufficient value to satisfy 120 per cent. of the accrued capital entitlement of the ZDP Shares then in issue net of Pledged Cash.\nKey information about the new ZDP Shares:\nExpected admission date (the \"\nSettlement Date\n\")\n8.00 a.m. on 12 November\nZDP Final Payment Date\n10 April 2024\nIssue price per ZDP Share\n161.5 pence\nFinal Capital Entitlement per ZDP Share\n201.4 pence\nRedemption Yield at the Placing Price\n5.1 per cent. per annum\nKey information about the total ZDP shares following the Placing:\nTotal number of ZDP Shares in issue\n18,101,857\nInitial Cover (IFRS book values)\n2.0 times\nInitial Cover (with EPRA revaluation adjustments)\n2.6 times\nHurdle rate to receive the Final Capital Entitlement (IFRS)\n-14.1 per cent. per annum\nHurdle rate to receive the Placing Price (IFRS)\n-15.4 per cent. per annum\nISIN\nGB00B99R1Q79\nSEDOL Code\nB99R1Q7\nTicker\nINLZ\nThe above Cover Ratio and Hurdle rates have been derived from the interim accounts of Inland Homes PLC as at 31 December 2018, calculated on the basis set out in the Prospectus, but adjusted further to reflect the increased number of ZDP Shares in issue following the Placing and the investment of the proceeds of the Placing in the Inland Group's business.\nCapitalised words in this announcement and which are not otherwise defined in this announcement have the same meanings as in the Prospectus unless the context otherwise requires.\nFurther information:\nFor further information please contact:\nInland Homes PLC\nStephen Wicks, Chief Executive\nNishith Malde, Finance Director\nGary Skinner, Managing Director\nTel: +44 (0) 1494 762450\nwww.inlandhomes.co.uk\nInland ZDP Ticker: INLZ\nEGR Broking Ltd\nAdviser/Joint Broker to ZDPCo\nDavid Floyd\nJonathan Hall\nTel: +44 (0)203 697 9496\nN+1 Singer Advisory LLP\nJoint broker to ZDPCo\nSales:\nPaul Glover\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7496 3073\nEditor's Note:\nInland Homes\nidentifies land in the South of England where it considers it to hold excellent potential for residential and mixed use development including commercial space.

If any Placee fails to pay the Placing Price as so directed and/or by the time required, the relevant Placee's application for ZDP Shares may, at the discretion of the Joint Brokers, either be rejected or accepted and, in the latter case, paragraph 1.2 of these terms and conditions shall apply.\n1.2 Each Placee is deemed to agree that if it does not comply with its obligation to pay the Placing Price for the ZDP Shares allocated to it in accordance with paragraph 1.1 of these terms and conditions and N+1 Singer elects to accept that Placee's application, the relevant Placee shall be deemed hereby to have appointed N+1 Singer or any nominee of N+1 Singer as its agent to use its reasonable endeavours to sell (in one or more transactions) any or all of the ZDP Shares allocated to the Placee in respect of which payment shall not have been made as directed, and to indemnify N+1 Singer and its affiliates on demand in respect of any liability for any costs or stamp duty reserve tax or any other liability whatsoever arising in respect of any such sale or sales. A sale of all or any of such ZDP Shares shall not release the relevant Placee from the obligation to make such payment for relevant ZDP Shares to the extent that N+1 Singer or its nominee has failed to sell such ZDP Shares at a consideration which, after deduction of the expenses of such sale and payment of stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax as aforementioned, exceeds the Placing Price.\n2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n2.1 By agreeing to subscribe for ZDP Shares under the Placing, each Placee which enters into a Placing Commitment to subscribe for ZDP Shares will (for itself and any person(s) procured by it to subscribe for ZDP Shares and any nominee(s) for any such person(s)) be deemed to represent, warrant and acknowledge to each of the Company, Inland Homes, Link Asset Services (the \"\nRegistrars\n\") and the Joint Brokers that:\n2.1.1 in agreeing to subscribe for ZDP Shares under the Placing, it is relying solely on this announcement and the Placing Letter and not on any other information given, or representation or statement made at any time, by any person concerning the Company, Inland Homes or the Placing.
