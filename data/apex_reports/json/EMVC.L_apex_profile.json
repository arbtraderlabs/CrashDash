This represents a c.21.5x increase on the Group's investment of \u00a362,000 (paid for by in-kind services) earlier in May 2024.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Wanda Health by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Wanda Health is 17.3 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a31.1 million. Such percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nThe Group has also entered into an unsecured convertible loan agreement with Wanda Health for \u00a350,000 (\nCLA\n) by means of exchanging receivables for that value from its in-kind services. The terms of the CLA include interest accruing at 10 per cent. per annum, a two year maturity date with the Group having the ability to convert some or all of the loan into further equity in Wanda Health at a 20 per cent. discount to its next fundraising round.\nDue to investor demand the Fundraising has been extended, with at least a further \u00a3200,000 anticipated to complete within December 2024.\nThe proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Wanda Health with the capital to execute its growth strategy, which includes:\n\u00b7\nEnhancing its AI capabilities by developing disease specific AI algorithms for readmission risk.\n\u00b7\nExpanding its market presence in US markets by targeting 'Fee for Service' and 'Value Based Care' models.\n\u00b7\nDeveloping white label solutions for its growing partner network in order to unlock new revenue streams across market segments.\n\u00b7\nAdvancing regulatory pathways toward FDA clearance for the first outpatient-based adjunctive predictive cardiovascular risk indicator.\nWanda Health recently announced a high-profile partnership with COPD Foundation providing it with access to world leading clinical experts, clinical guideline content, as well as joint marketing and advertising opportunities. This collaboration enhances Wanda Health's ability to refine its disease monitoring platform, particularly for conditions like COPD, which affects over 400 million people globally.\nWanda Health, a spinout from UCLA, is a leading remote patient monitoring and virtual care platform operating in the UK and US. Delivered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, it is cloud-hosted with proprietary machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Wanda Health empowers healthcare providers and payers by enabling early detection of health exacerbations across acute, chronic, and specialty disease spaces, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.\nWanda Health operates in a high-growth sector, with RPM projected to grow to $175 billion by 2027, Remote Therapeutic Management estimated to reach $17 billion by 2030, and Chronic Care Management predicted to reach $32 billion by 2033\u00b9. With a robust pipeline of growth opportunities, Wanda Health is well-positioned to lead the way in RPM and Virtual Care.\n1\n6Wresearch Market Research Report, September 2024\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Chair of Wanda\nHealth, commented:\n\"We are delighted to see Wanda Health successfully close this fundraising. This is a pivotal moment for Wanda Health as it continues to grow its leadership position in the rapidly expanding RPM market, building on its trans-Atlantic presence in the UK and US. EMV Capital is proud to have contributed strategic and investment support through our Venture Building programme.
