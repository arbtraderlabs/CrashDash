The award of equity incentives under the LTIP (the \"LTIP Award\") is an annual event, which normally takes place in the first quarter of each year, and has generally been made in the form of share options vesting over three years in annual tranches in the past few years; however, this year the Company has decided to issue Restricted Shares which only vest at the end of three years.\nTower Resources Chairman & CEO, Jeremy Asher, commented:\n\"\nWe have decided to issue Restricted Shares, vesting only after three years, rather than share options, for the Long Term Inventive Plan this year, for several reasons. First, we feel that giving employees shares rather than options better aligns their interests with those of other shareholders. Second, a given value of equity award requires the issue of fewer shares if the award is delivered in shares rather than in options. Third, and perhaps most importantly, as the number of senior employees in the Company increases, we feel that making an award of shares that has intrinsic value immediately, but value which cannot be realised by the employee unless they remain with us for the full vesting period, provides a stronger retention incentive than the traditional option scheme which usually vests in annual tranches over several years, and which also in practice often results in employees selling most of the shares to fund the option exercise and taxation.\n\"We do not intend to alter our overall policy regarding long term incentive awards: shares to be issued under such awards, whether in the form of restricted shares or share options, shall continue to be limited to 10% of the Enlarged Share Capital of the Company, being the sum of the currently issued shares and all future shares that the Company may be currently obliged to issue in future, including restricted shares, options or other conversion rights. This is also the basis we will continue to use for presenting individual directors' fully diluted shareholdings if all options and warrants are exercised.\"\nDetails of the LTIP grant to directors, PDMRs and consultants are set out below:\nDirector/PDMR\nExisting number of LTIP share options\nNumber of new LTIP Restricted Shares granted\nTotal number of LTIP options and Restricted Shares held following issue\nJeremy Asher\u2021\n1,220,000,000\n640,000,000\n1,860,000,000\nMark Enfield\n-\n240,000,000\n240,000,000\nHonore Dairou\n412,000,000\n200,000,000\n612,000,000\nConsultants\n132,500,000\n385,000,000\n517,500,000\nOthers\n35,500,000\n75,000,000\n110,500,000\nTOTAL\n1,800,000,000\n1,540,000,000\n3,340,000,000\n\u2021 Held by Pegasus Petroleum Ltd, which is owned and controlled by Jeremy Asher\nLTIP Awards outstanding\nFollowing this current grant of LTIP awards, the total number of shares (including Restricted Shares and shares subject to options) which the Company may be obliged to issue under outstanding LTIP Awards is 3,340,000,000 equating to 9.7% of the Company's enlarged share capital assuming full exercise of all warrants and share options.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').

Borr Drilling's latest advice is that the Norve rig is expected to be able to mobilise to Cameroon between June and August 2024, subject to its existing contractual commitments.\nThe Company will make further announcements about the financing of the well and the mobilisation of the rig as firm agreements and notices are finalised and received.\nTower Resources Chairman & CEO, Jeremy Asher, commented:\n\"We are delighted to share this news, and grateful to the MINMIDT, the Societe Nationale de Hydrocarbures, and the Prime Minister and President of the Republic of Cameroon, for their continuing support.\n\"We remain confident in finalising asset-level financing for the well, for which this extension was a critical condition precedent. However, we cannot comment further on the commercial discussions in progress until firm agreements are reached.\n\"In the meantime, we are also continuing our work on the evaluation and prioritisation of leads and prospects on our Namibian licence in light of the basin modelling work we recently completed, and we have been discussing the next steps on our South African Algoa-Gamtoos license with our joint venture partner and operator, NewAge.

ZM's remaining 5% interest in the PEL96 license will be fully carried through to production, as is the 10% interest held by the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (Proprietary) Limited (\"NAMCOR\"). TRNL has already funded all of the expenses associated with ZM's interest to date, so no further reimbursement of past costs is due to ZM. Completion of the purchase is subject to usual conditions precedent, identical to those in the farm-out agreement that TRNL concluded with Prime Global Energies Limited (\"Prime\") in January 2025, including Namibian government approvals and consent of the other partners in the PEL96 license, and the two transactions are expected to complete at or about the same time, as both are subject to similar government consents. ZM has also confirmed its consent to the TRNL-Prime farm-out agreement. Tower expects to fund this acquisition on behalf of TRNL using a portion of the substantial amount of cash it is due to receive from the TRNL-Prime farm-out completion.\nFollowing completion of this purchase from ZM, and the farm-out of a 25% interest in the license to Prime, the interests in the PEL96 license will be as follows:\nTRNL 60% (Operator)\nPrime 25%\nNAMCOR 10% (Carried)\nZM 5% (Carried)\nThe next step in the approval process in Namibia is to provide details of both the TRNL-Prime farm-out agreement and this latest TRNL-ZM agreement to NAMCOR, to seek NAMCOR's consent to both transactions, after which the full package of documents and consents will be forwarded to the Ministry of Mines and Energy (\"MME\") for Ministerial approval. However, the Ministry is already aware of both transactions and is expecting the formal documentation in due course.\nTower still anticipates that the completion of the TRNL-Prime farm-out agreement may occur before the end of March, but as previously explained, this depends on the approval processes which involve several counterparties. However, the Company remains confident that the approvals will be provided, and that both the TRNL-Prime transaction and this latest TRNL-ZM transaction will be completed as anticipated in the Company's announcement on 10 January 2025.\nCameroon\nTower Resources Cameroon SA (\"TRCSA\") has already submitted the TRCSA-Prime farm-out agreement documentation and the request for a year's further extension of the First Exploration Period of the Thali license to the Cameroon Minister of Mines, Industry and Technological Development (\"MINMIDT\") for approval in January, and has discussed both matters with MINMIDT, the Societe Nationale des Hydrocarbures (\"SNH\") and the Cameroon Prime Minister. The Company's understanding is that the matter is now with the Office of the Presidency and awaiting formal Presidential approval. As with the Namibia farm-out, the Company remains confident that the approvals will be provided, and still hopes this may be around the end of March.\nThe Company has been offered a number of rigs which could be available at different times between June and December 2025, and on different, but reasonable, terms. The Company hopes to make a rig selection decision, albeit subject to the requisite approvals being granted, at the end of March or during April. For commercial reasons, the Company will not be commenting further on these discussions until they are finalised.\nIn order to support the procurement process for the rig and associated services, and to minimise the time required between the farm-out completion and being ready to take delivery of the rig, the Company has already started to make selective hires in anticipation of drilling, initially through flexible contractor agreements. This includes a Senior Operations Geologist reporting to Mark Enfield, Tower's Exploration Director, and a Senior Drilling Engineer reporting to the Company's Drilling Manager, Phil Church at Bedrock Drilling. Tower is also adding a highly experienced member of staff to its financial team to support the ongoing discussions regarding future bank financing.\nTower Resources Chairman & CEO, Jeremy Asher, commented:\n\"We are pleased with the progress we are making and also with the acquisition of this small additional interest in the Namibian PEL96 from our local partner ZM. This acquisition reflects our wish for ZM to move to a more sustainable fully-carried position, and also reflects our faith in the value of the PEL96 license at the same time that we are bringing in a new partner to manage risk and share funding obligations.\n\"We are already working hard on the well planning in Cameroon, as we are confident about the approval process, and want to ensure we are ready to drill the NJOM-3 well in good time. Forward planning usually improves both time and budget performance. I look forward to keeping you updated with our further progress.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').
