The Group delivered two consecutive quarters of profitability in the first half and has grown gross customer interest-earning balances over the last three quarters.\nCredit quality remains robust, with customers continuing to demonstrate financial resilience. Risk-adjusted income improved, supported by a lower cost of risk.\nOperating costs remained well controlled, with all necessary actions taken to deliver the additional \u00a315 million in transformation savings committed by year-end 2025. Our technology transformation programme, Gateway, is progressing as planned-enhancing efficiency, scalability, and unlocking long-term cost benefits.\nComplaint costs were meaningfully lower year-on-year, partly reflecting the revised Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) fee structure implemented on 1 April 2025. Since then, negligible Vanquis-related Claims Management Company (CMC) complaints have been referred to the FOS.\nThe recent Supreme Court judgment provides much-needed clarity, and we acknowledge the FCA's decision to consult on a motor finance compensation scheme. Vanquis did not participate in discretionary commission arrangements. Our position is clearly differentiated from the unfair relationship decision in the Johnson case, supported by stronger disclosures, much lower average commissions and clear customer consent.\nVanquis plays an important role in UK banking, and I am pleased with the momentum we are building. We remain focused on supporting our customers while delivering sustainable and profitable growth for all stakeholders.\"\nExecutive Summary\nThe Group returned to profit in 1H25, while delivering balance growth to drive long-term sustainable profitability. Management remains focused on operational efficiency and deploying capital in the most accretive opportunities to generate higher returns.\n\u00b7\nProfitability:\nThe Group was profitable in both quarters of 1H25, delivering a statutory profit before tax from continuing operations of \u00a36.2m (1H24: loss of \u00a346.1m) and was capital accretive with a statutory return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 3.1% (1H24: (18.9)%), in line with the guidance of low single digit ROTE for 2025.\n\u00b7\nBalance growth:\nGross customer interest-earning balances grew 7% in 1H25 to \u00a32,459m and the Group now expects to achieve greater than \u00a32.6bn of balances by the end of 2025 (c.\u00a32.6bn previously).\n\u00b7\nIncreased risk adjusted income:\nImproved credit quality drove a reduction in cost of risk to 6.6% (1H24: 8.5%), resulting in a 7% increase in risk adjusted income to \u00a3143.6m.\n\u00b7\nCost discipline:\nFurther transformation cost savings, lower complaint costs and the non-repeat of notable items improved the statutory cost: income ratio to 62.5% (1H24: 79.3%), and the Group remains on track to achieve a high 50s percent cost: income ratio for FY25.\n\u00b7\nComplaints:\nComplaint costs reduced 36% year-on-year to \u00a316.1m, with FOS fees reducing \u00a38.6m to \u00a34.5m. 1Q25 complaint costs were in line with expectations, with a lower run rate from 2Q25, as expected following the implementation of the revised FOS fee structure. The Group expects 2H25 complaint costs to be lower than 1H25.\n\u00b7\nVehicle Finance commission disclosures:\nVanquis did not participate in discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), so the Group would not be in scope for this element of any Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) motor finance compensation scheme. Whilst the FCA intends to consult on the inclusion of certain non-discretionary commission arrangements following the unfair relationship Supreme Court decision in the Johnson case, Vanquis believes its position is clearly differentiated on a number of grounds. These include, but are not limited to, the fact the Group provided significantly better commission disclosures than those in Johnson, with substantially lower average commissions relative to the charge for credit. Vehicle Finance customers also signed pre-contractual documentation confirming that a commission would be paid.\nAs a result, and in accordance with IAS 37, the Group has not provided for this matter but has disclosed a contingent liability.\n\u00b7\nRobust liquidity, funding and capital:\nThe Group remained highly liquid, with a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 366% (December 2024: 359%), was 84.6% (December 2024: 85.6%) retail funded, a core strength of the Group, and had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 18.5% (December 2024: 18.8%), with sufficient capital for future growth.\nGroup financial results\nIncome Statement (\u00a3m)\n1H25\n2H24\n(Re-presented1)\n1H24\n(Re-presented1)\nHoH\nChange\n%\nYoY\nChange\n%\nInterest income\n274.9\n273.9\n276.0\n-\n-\nInterest expense\n(72.7)\n(73.3)\n(68.7)\n(1)\n6\nNet interest income\n202.2\n200.6\n207.3\n1\n(2)\nNon-interest income\n17.5\n19.0\n19.5\n(8)\n(10)\nTotal income\n219.7\n219.6\n226.8\n-\n(3)\nImpairment charges\n(76.1)\n(92.3)\n(93.0)\n(18)\n(18)\nRisk-adjusted income\n143.6\n127.3\n133.8\n13\n7\nOperating costs\n(137.4)\n(219.2)\n(179.9)\n(37)\n(24)\nProfit/(loss) before tax from continuing operations\n6.2\n(91.9)\n(46.1)\nTax (charge)/credit\n(1.3)\n6.8\n10.6\nProfit/(loss) after tax from continuing operations\n4.9\n(85.1)\n(35.5)\nProfit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations\n0.7\n1.6\n(0.3)\nStatutory profit/(loss) after tax\n5.6\n(83.5)\n(35.8)\nBalance Sheet (\u00a3m)\nJun-25\nDec-24\nJun-24\nHoH\nChange\n%\nYoY\nChange\n%\nGross customer interest-earning balances\n2,459\n2,308\n2,252\n7\n9\nAverage gross customer interest-earning balances (excluding Personal Loans)\n2,339\n2,208\n2,201\n6\n6\nGross receivables\n2,570\n2,416\n2,361\n6\n9\nNet receivables\n2,325\n2,155\n2,010\n8\n16\nClosing tangible net asset value (TNAV)10\n362\n358\n371\n1\n(3)\nAverage tangible equity8\n361\n362\n382\n(-)\n(5)\nSelected key metrics (%)\n1H25\n2H24\n(Re-presented1)\n1H24\n(Re-presented1)\nHoH\nChange\nYoY\nChange\nAsset yield2\n21.8\n22.4\n23.2\n(0.6)\n(1.4)\nNet interest margin (NIM)3\n17.4\n18.1\n18.9\n(0.7)\n(1.5)\nTotal income margin (TIM)4\n18.9\n19.8\n20.7\n(0.9)\n(1.8)\nCost of risk5\n(6.6)\n(8.3)\n(8.5)\n1.7\n1.9\nRisk-adjusted margin (RAM)6\n12.4\n11.5\n12.2\n0.9\n0.2\nStatutory cost: income ratio7\n62.5\n99.8\n79.3\n(37.3)\n(16.8)\nStatutory ROTE8\n3.1\n(45.9)\n(18.9)\nSelected per share metrics (p)\nHoH Change %\nYoY\nChange %\nBasic earnings per share (EPS)9\n2.2\n(32.6)\n(14.1)\nDividend per share\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTNAV per share10\n142\n140\n146\n1\n(3)\nNotable items (\u00a3m)\nAccount line\nJun-25\nDec-24\nJun-24\nGoodwill write-off\nOperating costs\n-\n(71.2)\n-\nTransformation and other exceptional costs\nOperating costs\n-\n(8.6)\n(15.5)\nAmortisation of acquisition intangibles\nOperating costs\n-\n(2.0)\n(4.2)\nVehicle Finance receivables review\nIncome\n-\n(1.4)\n(3.1)\nImpairment\n-\n(5.4)\n(9.7)\nOther one-off cost items\nOperating costs\n-\n-\n(10.2)\nTotal notable items\n-\n(88.6)\n(42.7)\n1H25 Financial Highlights\nIncome Statement\nAll commentary relates to year-on-year performance unless otherwise stated.\nIncome\n\u00b7\nNet interest income decreased 2% to \u00a3202.2m and total income reduced 3% to \u00a3219.7m, driven largely by higher year-on-year cost of funds.\no\nInterest income was broadly flat at \u00a3274.9m, reflecting a 6% increase in average gross customer interest-earning balances to \u00a32,339m offset by the mix effect of growing lower-risk and lower-margin Second Charge Mortgages.\n\u00a7\nAsset yield decreased 140bps to 21.8%, reflecting the lower yield on Second Charge Mortgages. Credit Cards yield reduced marginally, reflecting growth in 0% balance transfer (BT) and promotional products, while Vehicle Finance yield improved.\no\nInterest expense increased 6% year-on-year to \u00a372.7m, but reduced 1% half-on-half, reflecting a peak in cost of funds in 2H24 when maturing fixed term deposits were refinanced at higher market rates.\no\nThe combination of these factors drove a reduction in NIM to 17.4% (1H24: 18.9%).\no\nNon-interest income reduced 10% to \u00a317.5m reflecting lower fee and commission income.\nImpairment\n\u00b7\nImpairment charges reduced 18% to \u00a376.1m driven by the non-repeat of the \u00a39.7m prior year impact of the Vehicle Finance receivables review. C\nredit risk in the underlying book improved, with reduced adverse stage migrations.\no\nNet charge-offs, calculated as gross charge-offs less recoveries, increased 4% to \u00a393.5m.\no\nImpairment charges driven by originations increased 21% to \u00a325.7m, reflecting growth in new gross customer interest-earning balances.\no\nNet risk movements from stage migrations and changes in post model adjustments (PMAs) resulted in a lower net increase in impairment of \u00a351.9m (1H24: \u00a382.4m). This was partially offset by lower releases from write-offs and debt sales, reducing impairment by \u00a389.4m (1H24: \u00a397.3m).\no\nCost of risk reduced 190bps to 6.6%.\n\u00b7\nAs a result, risk adjusted income improved 7% to \u00a3143.6m, driving a 20bps improvement in risk adjusted margin to 12.4%.\nOperating costs\n\u00b7\nOperating costs decreased 24% to \u00a3137.4m.\no\nThis reflected the non-repeat of \u00a329.9m of prior year cost notable items, including \u00a315.5m of transformation and other exceptional costs and \u00a310.2m of other one-off costs largely relating to the write-off of a legacy mobile app.\no\nThe remaining \u00a312.6m reduction reflected \u00a38.9m lower complaint costs, and continued transformation savings of \u00a37.9m, more than offsetting growth and inflation driven cost increases and accruals for discretionary staff costs.\no\nThis delivered a statutory cost: income ratio of 62.5% (1H24: 79.3%).\nProfits\n\u00b7\nProfit before tax from continuing operations was \u00a36.2m (1H24: loss of \u00a3(46.1)m).\n\u00b7\nThe tax charge of \u00a31.3m (1H24: credit of \u00a310.6m) broadly reflected the mainstream UK corporation tax rate of 25.0% on the profit before tax from continuing operations.\n\u00b7\nProfit after tax from continuing operations was \u00a34.9m (1H24: loss of \u00a3(35.5)m).\n\u00b7\nProfit after tax from discontinued operations was \u00a30.7m (1H24: loss of \u00a3(0.3)m), related to the Personal Loans portfolio, the sale of which completed at the end of 1Q25.\n\u00b7\nStatutory profit after tax was \u00a35.6m (1H24: loss of \u00a3(35.8)m) and ROTE was 3.1% (1H24: (18.9)%).\nBalance Sheet\n\u00a3m\nJun-25\nDec-24\nJun-24\nHoH\nChange\n%\nYoY\nChange\n%\nAssets\nCash and balances at central banks\n805\n1,004\n773\n(20)\n4\nAmounts receivable from customers (net receivables)\n2,325\n2,154\n2,009\n8\n16\nPension asset\n13\n28\n34\n(54)\n(62)\nGoodwill and other intangibles\n64\n63\n133\n2\n(52)\nOther assets\n240\n126\n136\n90\n76\nTotal assets\n3,447\n3,375\n3,085\n2\n12\nLiabilities\nRetail deposits\n2,464\n2,428\n1,938\n1\n27\nBank and other borrowings\n448\n410\n504\n9\n(11)\nTrade and other payables\n56\n46\n50\n22\n12\nOther liabilities\n44\n50\n63\n(12)\n(30)\nTotal liabilities\n3,012\n2,934\n2,555\n3\n18\nAll commentary is relative to the December 2024 balance sheet, unless otherwise stated.\n\u00b7\nGross customer interest\n-\nearning balances increased 7% to \u00a32,459m:\no\nCredit Card balances increased 6% to \u00a31,355m,\nall in 2Q25 following stable balances in 1Q25, reflecting both credit line increases of existing customers, and new customer growth following the release of new product variants.\no\nVehicle Finance balances declined 4% to \u00a3733m, in line with expectations, ahead of the launch of our new onboarding and servicing platform in mid-2026 as part of the Gateway technology transformation.\no\nSecond Charge M\nortgage balances grew to \u00a3371m (December 2024: \u00a3217m) driven by long-term forward flow origination agreements with partners.\no\nPersonal Loan balances reduced to nil (December 2024: \u00a349m) following the sale of the portfolio at the end of 1Q25.\n\u00b7\nNet receivables increased 8% to \u00a32,325m, driven by growth in interest-earning balances and a 5% reduction in expected credit losses (ECL) to \u00a3245m, reflecting a clearer understanding of the credit risk of the portfolios.\n\u00b7\nTotal assets increased 2% to \u00a33,447m, driven by the 8% increase in net receivables.\n\u00b7\nCash and balances at central banks reduced 20% to \u00a3805m, driven largely due to increased purchases of UK Government securities, as part of our strategy to diversify the Liquid Asset Buffer beyond Bank of England (BoE) deposits. This drove the 90% increase in other assets, which rose to \u00a3239m. Most of the remaining cash continued to represent high quality liquid assets (HQLA) placed with the BoE.\n\u00b7\nThe pension asset reduced to \u00a313m (December 2024: \u00a328m), reflecting the preliminarily results from the most recent Scheme valuation and updated market assumptions.\n\u00b7\nLiabilities increased 3% to \u00a33,012m, as retail deposits, inclusive of accrued interest, increased 1% to \u00a32,464m, driven by continued optimisation of retail funding through a broader product range, including Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), and distribution reach through the Snoop brand.\n\u00b7\nBank and other borrowings increased 9% to \u00a3447m driven by increased utilisation of the Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR) facility as part of the Sterling Monetary Framework.\nCapital, Liquidity and Funding\nJun-25\nDec-24\nJun-24\nHoH\nChange\nYoY\nChange\nTier 1 ratio (%)11\n18.5\n18.8\n19.8\n(0.3)\n(1.3)\nRisk weighted assets (RWAs) (\u00a3m)\n1,883\n1,835\n1,813\n3%\n4%\nHigh quality liquid assets (HQLA) (\u00a3m)\n873\n947\n717\n(8)%\n22%\nLiquidity coverage ratio (LCR) (%)\n366\n359\n557\n(7)\n(191)\nRetail deposits (\u00a3m)\n2,424\n2,399\n1,912\n1%\n27%\nRetail funding (% of all funding)12\n84.6\n85.6\n79.3\n(1.0)\n5.3\nAll commentary is relative to the December 2024 capital liquidity and funding positions, unless otherwise stated.\nCapital\n\u00b7\nTier 1 capital ratio reduced 30bps to 18.5%. Capital accretion from the statutory profit after tax and a 40bps improvement from the Personal Loans portfolio sale was more than\noffset by growth driving a 3% increase in RWAs to \u00a31,883m.\no\nThis represented a surplus of \u00a396m of Tier 1 capital above the Group's disclosed Tier 1 capital requirement and regulatory combined buffers of 13.4%.\no\nTier 1 capital increased to \u00a3348m (December 2024: \u00a3344m).\no\nThe reduction in the ratio included the deployment of \u00a3104m of Credit Risk RWAs, including in Credit Cards and lower RWA density Second Charge Mortgages, in addition to intangible spend of \u00a37m. This capital investment reduced the ratio by 150bps.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's leverage ratio of 12.5% (December 2024: 13.9%) remains comfortably above the minimum requirement.\nLiquidity\n\u00b7\nThe liquidity buffer of \u00a3873m (December 2024: \u00a3947m) included c.\u00a3115m invested in UK gilts, with the remainder held in the BoE reserve account. This resulted in excess liquidity over the LCR 100% minimum of \u00a3619m (December 2024: \u00a3667m), reflecting an LCR of 366% (December 2024: 359%).\nFunding\n\u00b7\nRetail deposits increased 1% to \u00a32,424m, delivering funding at an attractive cost of funds compared to wholesale alternatives. Within the retail deposit base, fixed-term products reduced 9% to \u00a31,285m, retail notice accounts reduced 10% to \u00a3544m and easy access accounts reduced 12% to \u00a3329m. These reductions were replaced by \u00a3265m of Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) (December 2024: \u00a36m), as the Group broadened its product range to optimize the cost of funds.\n\u00b7\nThe Group remains primarily funded by retail deposits, at 84.6% (December 2024: 85.6%) of total funding including Tier 2 capital.\n\u00b7\nOngoing funding diversification is provided by Tier 2 capital, modest levels of private securitisation secured by Vehicle Finance assets, and access to Central Bank facilities collateralised using Credit Card assets.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's cost of funds reduced to 5.3% (December 2024: 5.5%), reflecting the reduced rate outlook and maturing fixed-term deposits being refinanced with lower interest rate savings products.\nOutlook and Guidance\nThe Group's financial guidance for 2025 and 2026 remains unchanged, except for gross customer interest-earning balances in 2025. The Group now expects to achieve greater than \u00a32.6bn of balances by the end of 2025 (c.\u00a32.6bn previously).\n2025 Statutory Guidance\n2026 Statutory Guidance\nGross customer interest-earning balances\n>\u00a32.6bn\nc.\u00a33.0bn\nROTE\nLow single digits\nLow double digits\nNIM\n>17%\n>16%\nCost: income ratio\nHigh 50s\nLow 50s\nTier 1 ratio\n>17.5%\nIn 2027, continue to guide to mid-teens ROTE and a cost: income ratio of 49% or lower.\nAs announced with FY24 results, the Group has transitioned to reporting solely on a statutory basis.

The Group expects 2H25 complaint costs to be lower than 1H25.\n\u00b7\nSince the revised FOS fee structure was implemented on 1 April 2025, Vanquis related CMC complaints referred to the FOS have been negligible.\no\nCMCs are charged an upfront fee of \u00a3250 for each claim submitted, reducing to \u00a375 for upheld cases.\no\nLender fees have reduced from \u00a3650 per case to \u00a3475 for each case not upheld.\n\u00b7\nVanquis continues to engage with regulators to address complaints issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\u00b7\nThe Group supports the Government's planned changes to reform the FOS.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the successful strike out hearing outcome in the court case against The Money Solicitor (TMS Legal Ltd.), the CMC responsible for the most unmerited claims in recent years, legal proceedings now progress to trial.\nMotor finance commission disclosures update\n\u00b7\nThe Group welcomes the clarity provided by the recent Supreme Court Judgment regarding motor finance commission disclosure practices. The Supreme Court concluded that motor dealers, when acting as credit brokers, do not owe fiduciary duties to their customers.\n\u00b7\nIn the\nJohnson\ncase, the Supreme Court found that an unfair relationship existed between the lender and the borrower under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. However, the Court emphasized that the test for unfairness is highly fact-sensitive, requiring assessment across a broad range of circumstances.\n\u00b7\nThe Group acknowledges the FCA's intention to consult on a motor finance compensation scheme. The FCA propose the scheme covers discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs). Vanquis did\nnot\nparticipate in DCAs and would therefore not be in scope for this element of any scheme.\n\u00b7\nWhilst the FCA also intend to consult on the inclusion of certain non-discretionary commission arrangements following the unfair relationship Supreme Court decision in the Johnson case, Vanquis believes its position is\nclearly differentiated\non a number of grounds\n.\nThese include, but are not limited to, the fact the Group provided significantly better commission disclosures than those in\nJohnson,\nwith substantially lower average commissions relative to the charge for credit. Vehicle Finance customers also signed pre-contractual documentation confirming that a commission will be paid.\n\u00b7\nAs a result, the Group believes that any liability is limited and, as such, in\u00a0accordance with IAS 37, has not\u00a0made a provision for this matter, but has disclosed a contingent liability.\n\u00b7\nThe FCA has extended the timeline on Vehicle Finance commission complaints, currently running until 4 December 2025, which is subject to further extension.\n\u00b7\nAs of 4 August 2025, the Group had received approximately 16,700 complaints alleging an unfair relationship related to the commission amount - out of around 62,000 total complaints under the extension. This marks an increase from around 4,500 at the end of 2024, driven by heightened public awareness following recent legal and regulatory developments.\n\u00b7\nAround 99% of these complaints have been submitted by CMCs.\n\u00b7\nThe Group has successfully defended 46 out of 49 Vehicle Finance commission court cases. Additionally, over 400 decisions at the FOS Adjudicator level have been in the Group's favour, with no adverse outcomes to date.\n\u00b7\nVanquis remains confident in its position and continues to assess each complaint on its individual merits.\nResults webcast\nIan McLaughlin, CEO, and Dave Watts, CFO, will host a results webcast at 09:00 today.

Cost of risk is calculated as impairment charges for the period as a percentage of average gross customer interest-earning balances for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December using a 7 point month end average.\n6. Risk-adjusted margin is defined as risk-adjusted income for the period as a percentage of average gross customer interest-earning balances for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December using a 7 point month end average.\n7.\nCost: income ratio is calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total income for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December.\n8.\nROTE is calculated as annualised statutory profit after tax for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December as a percentage of average tangible equity for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December. Tangible equity is stated as equity after deducting the Group's pension asset, net of deferred tax, less intangible assets and goodwill.\n9.\nBasic earnings per share is calculated as statutory profit after tax for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.\n10.\nTNAV per share is calculated as closing tangible net asset value, divided by the period end number of shares in issue. Tangible net asset value is stated as equity after deducting the Group's pension asset, net of deferred tax, less intangible assets and goodwill.\n11.\nThe Tier 1 ratio is calculated as the ratio of the Group's Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Group's risk-weighted assets measured in accordance with the CRR.\n12. Retail funding as a percentage of all funding has been restated to include Tier 2 capital within the total on-balance sheet funding of the Group.\nForward looking statements\nThis report may contain certain \"forward looking statements\" regarding the financial position, business strategy or plans for future operations of Vanquis Banking Group.

Net interest income reduced 2% to \u00a3154.3m, with non-interest income decreasing 14% to \u00a316.0m. Net interest margin increased 0.5% to 24.0% and total income margin increased 0.2% to 26.5%.\nInterest income decreased 3% to \u00a3179.0m, consistent with a 3% reduction in average gross customer interest-earning balances to \u00a31,296m. Asset yield increased 0.2% to 27.8%, driven by risk-based repricing initiatives and despite growth in 0% balance transfers (BTs) and products.\nInterest expense reduced 8% to \u00a324.7m, driven by the lower funding need and lower cost of funds, as the reduced rate outlook and maturing fixed-term deposits were refinanced with lower interest rate savings products.\nImpairment charges were broadly stable at \u00a364.0m (1H24: \u00a363.5m), reflecting increased origination charges in line with growth in new gross customer interest earning balances offset by an increased IFRS9 modelled impairment benefit, as underlying credit quality improved.

A new lending decision engine was introduced in 2024 enabling a more granular level of portfolio segmentation and delivered a stronger platform to optimise higher-margin customer segments in 1H25.\nGross customer interest-earning balances decreased 14% to \u00a3733m, driven by the combination of the prior year impact of the Vehicle Finance receivables review resulting in an updated charge-off policy reclassifying Stage 3 impaired loans to post-charge-off assets, and the moderating of new business growth.\nNet receivables decreased 7% to \u00a3709m, r\neflecting the reduction in interest-earning balances and\na 46% reduction in ECL to \u00a386m. ECL reduced across stages given the reduction in balances, but particularly in Stage 3 driven by the reduction in impaired loans following the receivables review.\nTotal income decreased 10% to \u00a348.6m, which represented all net interest income. Net interest margin and total income margin increased 0.3% respectively to 13.1%.\nInterest income decreased 10% to \u00a362.9m, consistent with a 12% reduction in average gross customer interest-earning balances to \u00a3750m. The asset yield increased 0.4% to 16.9%, driven by repricing initiatives.\nInterest expense reduced 9% to \u00a314.3m, driven by the lower funding need and lower cost of funds, as the reduced rate outlook and maturing fixed-term deposits were refinanced with lower interest rate savings products.\nThe prior year Vehicle Finance receivables review drove elevated impairment in 2024, resulting in a clearer cost of risk outlook for the portfolio. Impairment charges decreased 57% to \u00a312.7m, reflecting reduced origination charges in line with the reduction in new gross customer interest-earning balances and an increased IFRS9 modelled impairment benefit, as underlying credit quality improved. Cost of risk reduced 3.6% to 3.4%.\nRisk adjusted income increased 47% to \u00a335.9m and risk adjusted margin improved 3.9% to 9.7%.\nOperating costs decreased 19% to \u00a334.5m, driven by transformation cost savings, more than offsetting growth and inflation driven cost increases and an accrual for discretionary staff costs.\nProfit before tax contribution was \u00a31.4m (1H24: loss contribution of \u00a318.3m).\nSecond Charge Mortgages - Continued strong growth in a growing market\nSix months ended (\u00a3m)\nJun-25\nDec-24\n(Re-presented)\nJun-24\n(Re-presented)\nHoH\nChange\n%\nTotal customer numbers ('000)\n6.3\n3.7\n0.6\n70\nGross customer interest-earning balances\n371\n217\n30\n71\nAverage gross customer interest-earning balances1\n293\n121\n11\n142\nGross receivables\n385\n226\n32\n70\nNet receivables\n385\n225\n32\n71\nInterest income\n11.0\n4.6\n0.2\n139\nInterest expense\n(6.7)\n(3.1)\n(0.3)\n116\nNet interest income\n4.3\n1.5\n(0.1)\n187\nNon-interest income\n0.2\n-\n-\n100\nTotal income\n4.5\n1.5\n(0.1)\n200\nImpairment charges\n(0.2)\n(0.2)\n-\n-\nRisk adjusted income\n4.3\n1.3\n(0.1)\n231\nOperating costs\n(1.9)\n(0.4)\n(0.2)\n375\nProfit/(loss) before tax contribution\n2.4\n0.9\n(0.3)\n167\nAsset yield (%)2\n7.6\n7.6\nn/m\n-\nNet interest margin (%)3\n3.0\n2.5\nn/m\n0.5\nTotal income margin (%)4\n3.1\n2.5\nn/m\n0.6\nCost of risk (%)5\n(0.1)\n(0.3)\nn/m\n0.2\nRisk adjusted margin (%)6\n3.0\n2.1\nn/m\n0.9\nCost: income ratio (%)7\n42.2\n26.7\nn/m\n15.5\n1\nAverage of gross customer interest-earning balances for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December using a 7 point month end average.\n2\nInterest income from customer receivables for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December as a percentage of\u00a0average gross customer interest-earning balances.\n3\nNet interest income for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December as a percentage of average gross customer interest-earning balances.\n4\nTotal income for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December as a percentage of average gross customer interest-earning balances.\n5\nImpairment charges for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December as a percentage of average gross customer interest-earning balances.\n6\nTotal income less impairment charges for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December as a percentage of average gross customer interest-earning balances.\n7\nOperating costs as a percentage of total income for the 6 months ended 30 June and 31 December.\nAll commentary relates to year-on-year performance unless otherwise stated.\nTotal customer numbers increased to 6.3k (June 2024: 0.6k) following the successful growth of the forward flow agreement with\nInterbridge Mortgages and expanded partnership with Selina Finance\n.\nGross customer interest-earning balances increased to \u00a3371m (June 2024: \u00a330m) and net receivables increased to \u00a3385m (June 2024: \u00a332m), which includes deferred acquisition costs.\nTotal income increased to \u00a34.5m (1H24: \u00a3(0.1)m).

Principal risk categories and associated risk appetite statements, metrics and thresholds are reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis, effectively defining the Group's overall risk appetite.\nCustomer Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that failing to understand or address customer needs could lead to dissatisfaction, poor customer outcomes, reduced loyalty and reputational damage, impacting revenue and long-term business sustainability. The Group closely monitors customer outcomes to ensure the fair treatment of customers, particularly for customers requiring early intervention strategies or those with vulnerable characteristics, and address customer detriment. Complaints related to responsible lending have declined since the implementation of the FOS fee-charging structure. However, following the recent Supreme Court ruling, the Group continues to await the outcome of the FCA's consultation on a proposed compensation scheme for motor finance customers.\nRegulatory Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that non-compliance with all regulatory and legal requirements and expectations could lead to financial penalties, legal action, operational disruptions and long-term damage to reputation. The Group aims to avoid material regulatory breaches and, in the event that they do occur, they are promptly corrected and lessons learned from mistakes made. Strong and proactive regulatory relationships are in place with the FCA and PRA, who remain up to date with the Group's strategic initiatives, key risk management activities and responses to regulatory developments.\nFinancial Crime Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that failure to detect and prevent financial crime and fraud could result in customer detriment, regulatory fines, reputational damage and financial loss. The Group has dedicated fraud and financial crime strategic and operational teams, which monitor, investigate and report suspicious activity to meet regulatory obligations, remain vigilant of evolving external emerging threats and protect the Group and our customers from financial crime and fraud. The Group continues to strengthen its financial and fraud control environment through Gateway development.\nCapital Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that inadequate capital resources or poor capital planning could result in an inability to meet financial obligations, regulatory breaches and financial instability, potentially threatening the long-term viability of the Group. The Group and Bank operate within a defined capital risk appetite, with performance and capital position reported to and closely monitored by the Risk Committee and Board. Sufficient capital resources, both in terms of amount and quality, are maintained to support the business strategy and meet the stressed scenarios identified in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The Group and Bank have remained above regulatory buffer requirements throughout 2025.\nFunding and Liquidity Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its obligations (cash or collateral requirements) as they fall due, resulting in the failure to meet regulatory liquidity requirements, or is only able to secure such resources at excessive cost. Funding and liquidity metrics are monitored through daily liquidity reporting and reported to the Risk Committee and Board. The Group's current funding strategy seeks to maintain a secure and diverse funding structure by maintaining access to the liquid retail deposits market and committed facilities to meet the Group's liquidity and funding requirements. Throughout 2025, the Group and Bank have maintained funding and liquidity ratios in excess of regulatory requirements.\nMarket Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that fluctuations in market prices, such as interest rates, could negatively impact the Group's financial performance, resulting in losses or disruptions. The Group and Bank are primarily exposed to Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and do not take significant unmatched positions or operate trading books. The Group and Bank have remained within risk appetite throughout 2025. Market risk appetite metrics include the risk under different interest rate risk scenarios, as prescribed by regulation, which are reported to the Risk Committee and Board.\nCredit Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that customers may default on their obligations, leading to financial losses, impaired asset quality and reputational damage. The credit risk programme, initiated during 2024 to optimise the Group's credit decisioning capability and enhance its credit and affordability strategies, is progressing to plan, ensuring credit risk is at the forefront of business decisioning and keeps pace with changing market and economic conditions. The Credit Risk Committee meets monthly to oversee the programme and monitor portfolio performance against key credit risk metrics.\nPeople Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that poor recruitment practices, insufficient employee training or low engagement levels caused by poor culture and compliance could lead to operational inefficiencies and reputational damage. To effectively manage people risk, adequate controls exist across the colleague lifecycle covering onboarding, development and management of our colleagues. The Group's operating model is reviewed to ensure it has sufficient operational capacity and colleagues with the right skills to meet the Group's financial, customer and regulatory responsibilities. The Pulse Survey completed in June saw the engagement score rise to 65% since the Colleague Survey conducted in December 2024, providing further insight to advocate the Group as a great place to work.\nTechnology and Information Security Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that inadequate technological, security and data infrastructure and failure to upgrade systems could lead to operational inefficiencies, data breaches, service disruptions, a lack of scalability and reputational damage. Additional focus has been placed on technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, of which supporting governance structures are maturing. The Group's technology and information security risk is being significantly strengthened through the delivery of the Gateway technology and Data & Analytics transformation programmes, which are progressing to plan\nOperational Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that failures in processes, systems or human error could result in business disruptions, financial loss, regulatory action, poor customer outcomes and reputational damage. Operational risk is inherent to our Group's activities and heightened as we deliver our activities, utilising in-house capability and third-party and outsourced business support, and deliver transformation programmes. The application of the integrated assurance framework, inclusive of the Group's material controls, seeks to complement the assurance activities of each the three lines of defence.\nModel Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that incorrect assumptions, poor design or outdated data within models used for decision making could lead to unintended outcomes, financial loss or operational inefficiencies. All models and covered tools are required to be added and managed through the model inventory, which is reviewed monthly for completeness and accuracy. The model risk classification is in place reflecting the PRA's Model Risk Management Principles with clear delineation of responsibilities across the three lines of defence and oversight from the Model Risk Committee and supported by formals sub-working groups.\nBusiness Performance Risk\nThis is defined as the risk that poor performance of key business processes, such as financial management, operations or customer service, could lead to financial losses, reduced market share, threat to the Group's long-term viability and reputational damage. The Group continues to deliver against its strategic priorities, grow the business and maintain its existing commitments in a safe and controlled way, adopting an effective risk management, strong risk culture and remaining aware of emerging external threats.\nConsolidated financial statements\nConsolidated income statement for the six months ended 30

resources, held by Vanquis Bank Limited in accordance with the PRA's liquidity regime.\nNotes to the financial information\n1. Basis of preparation\nThe company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is No. 1 Godwin Street, Bradford, BD1 2SU. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements do not constitute the statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved by the board of directors on 13 March 2025 and have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those financial statements was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain any statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been reviewed, not audited, and were approved by the board of directors on 6 August 2025.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the UK. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and investments held at fair value through profit and loss.\nIn assessing whether the Group is a going concern, the directors' review has been made on the basis that the Group continues to operate for the twelve months from the date of the approval of the financial statements. The directors considered the appropriateness of the going concern basis, the period of assessment, any reporting requirements, and solvency and liquidity risks, and included a variety of factors - forecasts and budgets, timing of cashflows and funding, the Group's primary market and any contingent liabilities. When considering the appropriateness of going concern the directors have also considered the Group's ability to meets its regulatory requirements (both capital and liquidity) at all times and not just a positive net asset measure.\nThe assessment of going concern for the Group considered the following factors:\n\u00b7\nThe Group's corporate plan as approved in December 2024, and the latest 18 months forecast approved in July 25 which sets out financial, capital, liquidity and funding projections, together with an overview of relevant risks;\n\u00b7\nThe principal and emerging risks which could impact the performance of the Group, with a focus on capital and liquidity;\n\u00b7\nThe severe but plausible downside scenario, which is designed to assess the potential impact of certain underlying risks on the Group's capital and funding resources, together with the availability and effectiveness of mitigating actions;\n\u00b7\nAn idiosyncratic downside scenario assessing Vehicle Finance Commission outcomes; and\n\u00b7\nReverse stress testing analysis, which is designed to assess the point at which the Group is no longer a going concern;\nHaving considered the Group's forecasts, the regulatory capital and liquidity of the Group, the regulatory outlook and the impact of the Supreme Court judgment and FCA's intention to consult on Vehicle Finance commission, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approving these financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Group have been prepared on the going concern basis.\n2. Accounting policies\nGroup principal accounting policies under IFRS have been consistently applied to all the years presented, except where set out below.\nChange in accounting policies\nExceptional items\nThe Group has transitioned to reporting solely on a statutory basis, removing adjustments for goodwill write-offs, transformation and other exceptional costs, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles.\nThis follows actions taken in 2024 that resulted in a cleaner, lower-risk balance sheet and improved transparency at both Group and product levels. Adjusted performance is now expected to closely align with statutory results.\nThe accounting policy for exceptional items is therefore no longer in place. As this is a change in accounting policy the comparatives have been represented however there is\nno impact on recognition, measurement or total profit and loss in any period presented in this report. The change reflects a change in presentation of the income statement and associated metrics.\nRepresentation of items\nDiscontinued operations\nThe Group sold its Loan portfolio in MAR25. In accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' this business segment is now presented as discontinued operations. See note 5.\nSegmental reporting\nDuring 1H25, following the sale of the Personal Loans business, the Group now comprises four segments: the three core lending products - Credit Cards, Vehicle Finance, and Second Charge Mortgages - and the Corporate Centre. The Corporate Centre includes the residual performance of the Retail Savings business, Treasury results after product allocations, Snoop, and other immaterial or central items. As a result\n, all previous periods have been represented onto a consistent basis.\nThese changes do not constitute a change in accounting policy and there is no impact on recognition, measurement or profit and loss in any period presented in this re\nport. See note 4.\nFraud costs reclassification\nIn FY24 fraud costs were represented from impairment to within operating costs and the comparative numbers for 2023 restated. As part of this change, the reduction in customer receivables for Cards for fraud accounts was represented from allowance account to gross receivables.\nThe 1H24 comparatives presented in this report have been retrospectively re-presented. This change does not constitute a change in accounting policy and there is no impact on recognition, measurement or profit and loss in any period presented in this report. The impact of this change in 1H24 was a \u00a33.5m reduction in the total impairment charge and a corresponding increase in costs.\nThere was no impact on net receivables as a result of this change. These changes do not constitute a change in accounting policy and there is no impact on recognition, measurement or profit and loss in any period presented in this repo\nrt.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe significant accounting judgements exercised by management and key sources of estimation uncertainty in the\ninterim financial statements are consistent with those adopted in the statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 with the exception of Goodwill. Due to the impact of any judgement in relation to goodwill no longer being considered material, it is no longer included as a critical accounting judgement.\nAmounts receivable from customers (note 9)\nCritical accounting judgements\nThe Group reviews amounts receivable from customers for impairment at each balance sheet date. For the purposes of assessing the impairment, customers are categorised into IFRS 9 stages and cohorts which are considered to be the most reliable indication of future payment performance.\nThe determination of expected credit losses involves complex modelling techniques and requires management to apply significant judgements to calculate expected credit losses. The most critical judgements are outlined below.\nThe determination of the Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) thresholds to be used in the models for Credit Cards and Vehicle Finance requires management judgement to optimise the performance and therefore effectiveness of the staging methodology. Assessments are made to determine whether there is objective evidence of an SICR which indicates whether there has been an adverse effect on Probability of Default (PD). An SICR for customers is when there has been a significant increase in behavioural score or when one contractual monthly payment has been missed.\nFor the purpose of IFRS 9, default is assumed when three contractual repayments have been missed.\nThe Group's impairment models are subject to periodic monitoring, independent validation and back testing performed on model components (where appropriate), including PD, EAD, and LGD to ensure management judgements remain appropriate.\nLimitations in the Group's impairment models or data inputs may be identified through the ongoing assessment and validation of the output of the models. In these circumstances, management makes appropriate adjustments to the Group's allowance for impairment losses to ensure that the overall provision adequately reflects all material credit risks. These adjustments are determined by considering the particular attributes of exposures which have not been adequately captured by the impairment models and range from changes to model inputs and parameters, at account level, through to more qualitative post-model overlays. Those changes applied to model inputs and parameters are deemed to be in-model overlays; more qualitative changes that have a higher degree of management judgement are deemed to be post-model overlays. All adjustments are reviewed quarterly and are subject to internal review and challenge to ensure that amounts are appropriately calculated. A breakdown of the in-model and post-model overlays is included within note 9.\nCredit performance across the Group remains stable and internal analysis shows no obvious signs of credit quality deterioration.\nMacroeconomic impairment provision adjustments are recognised in the core model to reflect an increased PD, based on future macroeconomic scenarios. Management judgement was required to determine the appropriate macroeconomic indicators to be used in the model by assessing their correlation with credit losses incurred by the business.\nIn FY24 a model overlay of \u00a35.4m was recognised which looked at Credit Card write-off rates, utilising data from a third party. This third party model predicts industry level write-off rates using a combination of interest rates on Credit Cards, unemployment rate, debt to income ratio and a measure of macroeconomic volatility. The outputs from this model are calibrated to the VBG entry to default rate which is in turn used to derive the scalars applied to the lifetime probability of default model.\nDuring 1H25 the third party model was incorporated in the core model and an overlay is no longer held. The redeveloped internal model is expected to be implemented in 2H25.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe level of impairment recognised is calculated using models which utilise historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each cohort of customers in each arrears stage.\nThe models are regularly monitored to ensure they retain sufficient accuracy. Sensitivity analysis has been performed in note 9 which shows the impact of a 1% movement of gross exposure into Stage 2 from Stage 1 on the allowance accounts.\nMacroeconomic assumptions\nThe following table shows the scenario five-year peak and average third party model Credit Card write off rates. These estimates are used to derive base case, upside, downside and severe scenarios.\n30 June 2025\n31 December 2024\nBase\nUpside\nDownside\nSevere\nBase\nUpside\nDownside\nSevere\nWeighting\n60%\n15%\n20%\n5%\n60%\n15%\n20%\n5%\n2025\n0.46%\n0.40%\n0.51%\n0.52%\n0.46%\n0.44%\n0.47%\n0.47%\n2026\n0.48%\n0.28%\n0.64%\n0.69%\n0.50%\n0.36%\n0.61%\n0.64%\n2027\n0.47%\n0.22%\n0.74%\n0.80%\n0.52%\n0.27%\n0.71%\n0.78%\n2028\n0.45%\n0.20%\n0.76%\n0.82%\n0.49%\n0.22%\n0.75%\n0.83%\n2029\n0.44%\n0.20%\n0.74%\n0.80%\n0.45%\n0.20%\n0.73%\n0.81%\nFive year peak\n0.48%\n0.45%\n0.77%\n0.83%\n0.52%\n0.46%\n0.76%\n0.84%\nThe unemployment data used in the macroeconomic provisions held at 1H24 were compiled from a consensus of sources\nincluding the Bank of England, HM Treasury, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Bloomberg and a number of prime banks.

It has also considered the FCA's intention to consult on a motor finance compensation scheme. The Group believes its position is differentiated on a number of grounds and in accordance with IAS 37, the Group has not provided for this matter but has disclosed a contingent liability (see note 16).\nOther accounting judgements:\nIntangibles (note 11)\nAll intangible assets have been reviewed for impairment under IAS 36.\nFollowing the sale of the Personal Loans business in 1H25, the assets associated with that product were reviewed for impairment and subsequently written off. A charge of \u00a31.2m has therefore been recognised within discontinued operations.\nIn 1H24 the Credit Cards mobile app was written off in full following a decision to rebuild this functionality using a more efficient design and build approach leading to an overall better customer experience. The resulted in a cost of \u00a38.5m being recognised in 1H24 results.\nIn addition, assets expected to be replaced by the Gateway platform in 2026 were reviewed: a small number\nof these assets were written off, and the useful economic lives of other assets were reassessed in light of their expected retirement by the Gateway platform. The impact of these in FY24 results was not material.\nProvisions: Customer remediation complaints (note 14)\nOver the past two years Group has experienced elevated levels of customer compensation claims from claims management companies. The majority of these claims were speculative in nature, primarily driven by unmerited CMC activity, and related to a wide range of different matters, primarily in respect of the lending process but with no common theme or systemic issue. During 2024, the increase in costs and provision resulted from higher than expected FOS fees for cases not upheld by us which were expected to subsequently be submitted to FOS for adjudication.\nSince the change in the FOS fee charging structure from 1 April 2025, the Group has seen negligible CMC referrals to the FOS. This element of the provision has therefore been reduced, resulting in a \u00a32.9m release in the period.\nThe total cost to the Group of customer remediation costs, including resource, which relate to a wide range of different matters, amounts to \u00a316.1m in 1H25 (FY24:\u00a347.4m, 1H24 \u00a325.0m), with FOS fees reducing \u00a38.6m to \u00a34.5m (FY24:\u00a324.8m, 1H24 \u00a313.1m).\nA provision of \u00a32.5m (FY24:\u00a37.4m, 1H24 :\u00a38.2m) is held at the balance sheet date for: (i) customer compensation claims received where compensation may be paid but which have not yet been assessed, upheld or compensation amounts agreed (\u00a32.0m) (FY24: \u00a35.1m, 1H24 \u00a35.2m) ; and (ii) expected FOS fees for future claims which may be referred (\u00a30.5m) (FY24: \u00a32.3m, 1H24: \u00a33.0m).\nThe provision is determined based on the complaints volume pipeline at the period end, estimated uphold complaint rates, and average compensation amounts for each complaint type based on historical data.\n3.

Segment reporting\nDuring 1H25 the Group reviewed and reallocated interest income, interest expense and costs to different product segments as reported under IFRS 8. As a result, all previous periods have been represented onto a consistent basis.\nThese changes do not constitute a change in accounting policy and there is no impact on recognition, measurement or profit and loss in any period presented in this re\nport.\nThis re-presentation is a further step in Vanquis' on-going commitment to enhance disclosures and to provide a more transparent reporting of the Group's continuing operations by product.\nFollowing the sale of the Personal Loans business, the Group now comprises four segments: the three core lending products - Credit Cards, Vehicle Finance, and Second Charge Mortgages - and the Corporate Centre. The Corporate Centre includes the residual performance of the Retail Savings business, Treasury results after product allocations, Snoop, and other immaterial or central items.\nTo more accurately reflect the interest income and funding costs of each lending product, the Group has reallocated:\n\u00b7\nInterest income from non-product Treasury items has been moved from Credit Cards to the Corporate Centre.\n\u00b7\nInterest expense reallocation to better represent the cost of funding across products using funds transfer pricing, allowing for duration matching of assets and natural hedging across exposures. Interest expense related to Tier 2 capital, previously reported entirely in Corporate Centre, has been partially reallocated to individual products and the cost of the Vehicle Finance securitisation, previously allocated solely to Vehicle Finance, has been spread across all products, reflecting shared benefit from the funding structure.\n\u00b7\nOperating costs that were not directly attributable to a product and previously held in the Corporate Centre have been reallocated, based on either business size using a blended average of Credit risk-weighted assets (RWAs), to reflect capital consumption or Total income, to reflect revenue contribution, or service usage.\nThe Group has transitioned to reporting solely on a statutory basis. This follows actions taken in 2024 that resulted in a cleaner, lower-risk balance sheet and improved transparency at both Group and product levels. Adjusted performance is now expected to closely align with statutory results.\nAccordingly, the 2024 income statement and key metrics have been re-presented on a statutory basis, removing adjustments for goodwill write-offs, transformation and other exceptional costs, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles. The 2024 adjusting items comprising the goodwill write-off, transformation and other exceptional costs, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles, in addition to other-one off cost items, have remained within the Corporate Centre.\nThe impact of the 2024 Vehicle Finance receivables review, affecting both income and impairment, has remained within the Vehicle Finance segment.\nSix months ended 30 June 2025\nunaudited\nCredit Cards\nVehicle Finance\nSecond Charge Mortgages\nCorporate Centre\nTotal\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nInterest income\n179.0\n62.9\n11.0\n22.0\n274.9\nInterest expense\n(24.7)\n(14.3)\n(6.7)\n(27.0)\n(72.7)\nNet interest income\n154.3\n48.6\n4.3\n(5.0)\n202.2\nFee and commission income\n17.4\n-\n0.2\n0.8\n18.4\nFee and commission expense\n(1.4)\n-\n-\n(0.1)\n(1.5)\nNet fee and commission income\n16.0\n-\n0.2\n0.7\n16.9\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n0.6\nTotal income\n170.3\n48.6\n4.5\n(3.7)\n219.7\nImpairment charges\n(64.0)\n(12.7)\n(0.2)\n0.8\n(76.1)\nRisk-adjusted income\n106.3\n35.9\n4.3\n(2.9)\n143.6\nOperating costs\n(93.7)\n(34.5)\n(1.9)\n(7.3)\n(137.4)\nPBT/(LBT) from continuing operations\n12.6\n1.4\n2.4\n(10.2)\n6.2\nSix months ended 30 June 20241\nunaudited\nCredit Cards\nVehicle Finance\nSecond Charge Mortgages\nCorporate Centre\nTotal\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nInterest income\n183.6\n69.7\n0.2\n22.5\n276.0\nInterest expense\n(26.9)\n(15.7)\n(0.3)\n(25.8)\n(68.7)\nNet interest income\n156.7\n54.0\n(0.1)\n(3.3)\n207.3\nFee and commission income\n19.3\n-\n-\n0.8\n20.1\nFee and commission expense\n(0.7)\n-\n-\n(0.1)\n(0.8)\nNet fee and commission income\n18.6\n-\n-\n0.7\n19.3\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\n0.2\n0.2\nTotal income\n175.3\n54.0\n(0.1)\n(2.4)\n226.8\nImpairment charges\n(63.5)\n(29.5)\n-\n-\n(93.0)\nRisk-adjusted income\n111.8\n24.5\n(0.1)\n(2.4)\n133.8\nOperating costs\n(100.5)\n(42.8)\n(0.2)\n(36.4)\n(179.9)\nPBT/(LBT) from continuing operations\n11.3\n(18.3)\n(0.3)\n(38.8)\n(46.1)\n1\nRefer to accounting policies for details of representation\nRevenue between business segments is not material.\nSegment assets\nNet\nassets/(liabilities)\n30 June 2025\nunaudited\n31 December 2024\naudited\n30 June 2024\nunaudited\n30 June 2025\nunaudited\n31 December 2024\naudited\n30 June 2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nCredit cards, personal loans and second charge mortgages\n2,628.2\n2,514.8\n2,101.6\n358.6\n353.0\n360.6\nVehicle finance\n749.3\n775.5\n875.3\n128.0\n129.1\n189.3\nCentral\n(54.2)\n(2.6)\n47.6\n(51.9)\n(40.9)\n(20.2)\nIntra-group elimination\n123.4\n87.6\n60.6\n-\n-\n-\nTotal Group\n3,446.7\n3,375.3\n3,085.1\n434.7\n441.2\n529.7\nThe presentation of segment net assets reflects the statutory assets, liabilities and net assets of each of the Group's divisions. This results in an intra-group elimination reflecting the difference between the central intercompany funding provided to the divisions and the external funding raised centrally.

Discontinued operations\nThe Group sold its Loan portfolio in March 2025, in accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' this business segment is now presented as discontinued operations.\nThe 1H24 results have been re-presented to reflect this change:\n\u00b7\nThe operating costs included in the profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations reflect only those costs directly attributable to the Personal Loans business.\n\u00b7\nThe business continued to be reported as discontinued in 1Q25 until the sale completed.\n\u00b7\nThe 1H25 results includes a gain on sale of \u00a30.5m.\nThe results from discontinued operations, which are included in the Group income statement, are set out below.\nSix months ended 30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nInterest income\n1.4\n9.1\nInterest expense\n(0.3)\n(1.9)\nNet interest income\n1.1\n7.2\nTotal income\n1.1\n7.2\nImpairment\n3.1\n(4.8)\nRisk-adjusted income\n4.2\n2.4\nOperating costs\n(3.3)\n(2.8)\nProfit/(loss) before taxation\n0.9\n(0.4)\nTax (charge)/credit\n(0.2)\n0.1\nProfit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n0.7\n(0.3)\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share (p)\n0.3\n(0.1)\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share (p)\n0.3\n(0.1)\n6.\nTax (charge)/credit\nThe tax (charge)/credit in the income statement is as follows:\nSix months ended 30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nTax (charge)/credit on profit/(loss) from continuing operations\n(1.3)\n10.6\nTax (charge)/credit on profit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n(0.2)\n0.1\nTotal tax (charge)/credit\n(1.5)\n10.7\nThe tax (charge)/credit on profit/(loss) before tax has been calculated by:\n\u00b7\ncalculating the best estimate of the effective tax rate for each business for the financial year, excluding revaluations of deferred tax assets;\n\u00b7\napplying this to the profit/(loss) before tax for the relevant business for the period and aggregating the resultant amount; and\n\u00b7\nadding to this the revaluations of deferred tax assets in respect of share scheme awards where tax deductions are expected to be higher than (1H24: lower than) previously expected.\nThe tax (charge)/credit reflects:\n\u00b7\nthe beneficial (1H24: adverse) impact of revaluing deferred tax assets in respect of share scheme awards where tax deductions are expected to be higher than (1H24: lower than) previously expected; and\n\u00b7\nthe recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of carried forward tax losses, apart from pre-acquisition losses in Snoop, and other temporary differences on the basis the Group expects to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to enable such deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n7\n. Earnings/(Loss) per share\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share EPS/(LPS) is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year less the number of shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are used to satisfy the Groups share awards.\nDiluted EPS/(LPS) calculates the effect on EPS/(LPS) assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows:\n(i) For share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP), the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), the Restricted Share Plan (RSP)\nand the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: (i) the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes' performance period; and (ii) the performance targets have been met as at that date.\n(ii) For share options outstanding under non-performance-related schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme (SAYE), a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company's shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nPotential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share.\nReconciliations of basic and diluted EPS/(LPS) for the continuing operations and the Group are set out below:\nSix months ended 30 June unaudited\n2025\n2024\nEarnings\nWeighted\u00a0average\nnumber\nof\u00a0shares\nPer\nshare\namount\nLoss\nWeighted\u00a0average\nnumber\nof shares\nPer\nshare\namount\nContinuing operations\n\u00a3m\nm\npence\n\u00a3m\nm\npence\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share\n4.9\n254.5\n1.9\n(35.5)\n254.7\n(13.9)\nDilutive effect of share options and awards\n-\n7.7\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share\n4.9\n262.2\n1.9\n(35.5)\n254.7\n(13.9)\nSix months ended 30 June unaudited\n2025\n2024\nEarnings\nWeighted\u00a0average\nnumber\nof\u00a0shares\nPer\nshare\namount\nLoss\nWeighted\u00a0average\nnumber\nof shares\nPer\nshare\namount\nGroup\n\u00a3m\nm\npence\n\u00a3m\nm\npence\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share\n5.6\n254.5\n2.2\n(35.8)\n254.7\n(14.1)\nDilutive effect of share options and awards\n-\n7.7\n(0.1)\n-\n-\n-\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share\n5.6\n262.2\n2.1\n(35.8)\n254.7\n(14.1)\n8.

The goodwill was written off in full due to lower cash flows in the latest budget as the Group prioritises capital deployment for growth into Second Charge Mortgages and Credit Cards in the near-term.\nThe remaining \u00a31.2m goodwill relates to the acquisition of Snoop in 2023.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are any indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount is determined from a value in use calculation. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation relate to the cash flows of the cash generating unit, discount rates and growth rates adopted.\nManagement adopts pre-tax discount rates which reflect the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.\nThere were no indications of impairment in relation to the Snoop goodwill in 1H25.\n11.

The Snoop intangible asset comprised \u00a310.1m of internally generated core platform and technology, and \u00a31.0m in relation to the 'Snoop' brand name arising on the acquisition of Snoop in 2023. These are being amortised over 9 and 5 years respectively.\nAdditions to computer software of \u00a37.3m (FY24: \u00a312.5m; 1H24: \u00a34.5m) comprise costs associated with the Gateway platform development.\nIncluded with discontinued operations is amortisation of \u00a30.2m (FY24: \u00a31.4m; 1H24: \u00a30.7m) and the loss on disposal of \u00a31.2m (FY24: \u00a3nil; 1H24: \u00a3nil). The disposal relates to the write down of redundant IT systems used to support the loans business.\nIn 1H24 and FY24 \u00a38.5m of impairment relates to the write down of development costs for a mobile app which was considered redundant.\n12. Retirement benefit asset\nThe Group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme. The scheme is of the funded, defined benefit type. It is now also closed to future accrual.\nThe scheme provides pension benefits which were accrued on a final salary and, more recently, on a cash balance basis. With effect from 1 August 2021, it was fully closed to future accrual and benefits are no longer linked to final salary, although accrued benefits are subject to statutory inflationary increases.\nThe scheme is a UK registered pension scheme under UK legislation. The scheme is governed by a Trust Deed and Rules, with trustees responsible for the operation and governance of the scheme. The trustees work closely with the Group on\nfunding and investment strategy decisions. The most recent completed actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2021 by a qualified independent actuary. The 1 June 2024 actuarial valuation is ongoing and expected to be completed in 2H25.\nThe valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' has been based on the preliminary results of the 2024 valuation to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at the balance sheet date. Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet.\nThe Group is entitled to a refund of any surplus, subject to tax, if the scheme winds up after all benefits have been paid. As a result, the Group recognises surplus assets under IAS 19.\nThe Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are as follows:\n-\nInvestment risk - the liabilities for IAS 19 purposes are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the assets underperform this yield a deficit will arise. The scheme has a long-term objective to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that better match liabilities.\n-\nChange in bond yields - a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the liabilities, although this will be partly offset by an increase in matching assets.\n-\nInflation risk - some of the liabilities are linked to inflation. If inflation increases then liabilities will increase, although this will be partly offset by an increase in assets. As part of a long-term de-risking strategy, the scheme has increased its portfolio in inflation matched assets.\n-\nLife expectancies - the scheme's final salary benefits provide pensions for the rest of members' lives (and for their spouses' lives). If members live longer than assumed, then the liabilities in respect of final salary benefits increase.\nThe net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet of the Group is as follows:\n30 June\n31 December\n30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n2024\naudited\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nFair value of scheme assets\n447.5\n453.7\n481.0\nPresent value of defined benefit obligation\n(434.8)\n(425.9)\n(446.6)\nNet retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet\n12.7\n27.8\n34.4\nThe amounts recognised in the income statement were as follows:\n2025\nunaudited\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nAdministration costs and taxes\n(0.9)\n(0.5)\nInterest on scheme liabilities\n(11.5)\n(10.9)\nInterest on scheme assets\n12.3\n11.7\nNet (charge)/credit recognised in the income statement\n(0.1)\n0.3\nThe net (charge)/credit recognised in the income statement has been included within operating costs.\nMovements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows:\n30 June\n31 December\n30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n2024\naudited\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nFair value of scheme assets at 1 January\n453.7\n512.9\n512.9\nInterest on scheme assets\n12.3\n23.4\n11.7\nActuarial movements on scheme assets\n(6.8)\n(54.6)\n(31.4)\nContributions by the Group\n0.4\n0.8\n0.4\nNet benefits paid out\n(12.1)\n(28.8)\n(12.6)\nFair value of scheme assets at period end\n447.5\n453.7\n481.0\nMovements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows:\n30 June\n31 December\n30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n2024\naudited\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nPresent value of defined benefit obligation at 1 January\n(425.9)\n(474.7)\n(474.7)\nCurrent service cost\n(0.9)\n(1.3)\n(0.5)\nInterest on scheme liabilities\n(11.5)\n(21.7)\n(10.9)\nActuarial movement - experience\n(11.1)\n0.2\n26.9\nActuarial movement - demographic assumptions\n(5.1)\n(0.9)\n-\nActuarial movement - financial assumptions\n7.6\n43.7\n-\nNet benefits paid out\n12.1\n28.8\n12.6\nPresent value of defined benefit obligation at period end\n(434.8)\n(425.9)\n(446.6)\nThe principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows:\n30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n31 December 2024\naudited\n30 June 2024\nunaudited\n%\n%\n%\nPrice inflation - RPI\n2.95\n3.20\n3.25\nPrice inflation - CPI\n2.45\n2.75\n2.75\nRate of increase to pensions in payment\n2.90\n3.00\n3.00\nInflationary increases to pensions in deferment\n2.45\n2.75\n2.75\nDiscount rate\n5.65\n5.55\n5.25\nThe pension increase assumption shown above applies to pensions increasing in payment each year in line with RPI up to 5%. Pensions accrued prior to 2000 are substantially subject to fixed 5% increases each year. In deferment increases prior to retirement are linked to CPI.\nThe mortality assumptions are based on the self-administered pension scheme (SAPS) series 4 tables (FY24 and 1H24: SAPS series 3 tables):\n-\nfemale non-pensioners: 110% of the 'All' table (FY24 and 1H24: 105% of the 'Middle' table);\n-\nmale non-pensioners: 113% of the 'All' table (FY24 and 1H24: 105% of the 'Middle' table);\n-\nfemale pensioners: 110% of the 'All' table (FY24 and 1H24: 102% of the 'Middle' table); and\n-\nmale pensioners\n: 99% of the 'All' table (F\nY24 and 1H24: 99% of the 'All' table).\nThe above multipliers and table types were chosen following a study of the scheme's membership. Where the multiplier is greater than 100%, this reflects a shorter life expectancy within the scheme compared to average pension schemes, with the opposite being true where the multiplier is less than 100%.\nFuture improvements in mortality are based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) 2023 model with a long\n\u2011\nterm trend of 1.00% pa, the core parameters for the initial addition and smoothing parameter but with a weighting of 0%, 0%, 25% and 25% on 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 experiences respectively. All other available parameters for the mortality improvements model were adopted at the default (core) level. Under these mortality assumptions, the life expectancies of members are as follows:\nIf the discount rate decreased by 0.5% (FY24: 0.5%, 1H24: 0.5%), the defined benefit obligation (not including any impact on assets) would have been increased by approximately \u00a324m (FY24: \u00a3\n24\nm, 1H24: \u00a327m).\nMale\nFemale\n30 June 2025\nunaudited\n31 December\n2024\naudited\n30 June 2024\nunaudited\n30 June 2025\nunaudited\n31 December\n2024\naudited\n30 June 2024\nunaudited\nYears\nYears\nYears\nYears\nYears\nyears\nCurrent pensioner aged 65\n21.1\n21.2\n21.2\n22.9\n23.0\n23.0\nCurrent member aged 45 from age 65\n21.1\n21.2\n21.1\n24.0\n24.0\n23.9\nAn analysis of amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is set out below:\n30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n31 December 2024\naudited\n30 June 2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nActuarial movements on scheme assets\n(6.8)\n(54.6)\n(31.4)\nActuarial movements on scheme liabilities\n(8.6)\n43.0\n26.9\nTotal movement recognised in other comprehensive income in the year\n(15.4)\n(11.6)\n(4.5)\nCumulative movement recognised in other comprehensive income\n(175.3)\n(159.9)\n(152.8)\n13.

The front BGS is a bespoke over-the-counter interest rate swap that resizes in line with changes to the size and expected maturity profile of the loans in the securitisation. Only the interest rate risk on the portfolio is hedged; other risks such as credit risk are managed but not hedged.\nThe Group balance guarantee swap (back BGS) of \u00a32.0m asset (FY24: \u00a30.2m liability, 1H24: \u00a31.6m liability) eliminates the front BGS on consolidation in the Group accounts. The front BGS manages a risk that exists in the SPV accounts, but does not exist upon consolidation. The back BGS was transacted at historical rates and in compensation the Group received cash consideration for taking on a liability.\nThe front and back BGS naturally hedge and no hedge accounting is applied. Hedge accounting was discontinued on the front BGS in September 2022 with the hedging adjustment amortising over the remaining life of the receivables. Until termination, the hedging arrangement was accounted for under IAS 39 under the portfolio hedging rules.\nThe Tier 2 swap of \u00a33.7m liability (FY24: \u00a31.3m, 1H24: \u00a38.0m) is a vanilla unamortising swap that manages the Group's sensitivity to changes in interest rates arising from long-dated fixed-rate Tier 2 capital and short-dated Bank of England reserves. The Tier 2 swap pays annually a floating rate of daily compounded SONIA and receives a fixed annual rate of 3.521% bi-annually. The swap matures in October 2026.\nDuring 1H24 the Group entered into 7 additional swaps for hedging interest rate risk in the Second Charge Mortgages portfolio and the Financial Investments (UK Gilts) purchased during the period.\nThe 3 interest rate swaps for hedging the Second Charge Mortgages portfolio are collectively valued at \u00a30.1m liability (FY24: none) with maturities in May 2028, May 2029 and May 2030. The swaps pay a fixed rate and receive a floating daily compounded SONIA.\nThe 4 interest rate swaps for hedging the Financial Investments (UK Gilts) are collectively valued at \u00a30.7m liability (FY24: none) with maturities in March 2027, March 2028, June 2028, July 2029. The swaps pay a fixed rate and receive a floating daily compounded SONIA.\nExcept as detailed in the following table, the directors consider that the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values:\nCarrying value\nFair value\n30 June\n31 December\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n30 June\n2025\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n2024\naudited\n\u00a3m\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n2025\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\n2024\naudited\n\u00a3m\n2024\nunaudited\n\u00a3m\nFinancial assets\nAmounts receivable from customers\n2,325.1\n2,153.7\n2,008.5\n2,738.4\n2,488.5\n2,332.5\nFinancial liabilities\nRetail deposits\n(2,463.8)\n(2,428.2)\n(1,937.5)\n2,424.6\n(2,400.4)\n(1,908.7)\nBank and other borrowings\n(447.7)\n(410.0)\n(504.1)\n431.1\n(373.2)\n(483.0)\nTotal\n(2,911.5)\n(2,838.2)\n(2,441.6)\n2,855.7\n(2,773.6)\n(2,391.7)\n14.

These amounts, which are no longer considered to be financing cashflows, are now reported within cash generated from operations as a \u00a338.6m movement in retail deposits.\n16. Contingent liabilities\nDuring the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings (including class or group action claims) brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers, investors or third parties. This extends to legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions combined with tax authorities taking a view that is different to the view the Group has taken on the tax treatment in its tax returns. It also extends to tax authorities taking the view that VAT exempt supplies received by the Group from UK-based suppliers should be subject to VAT.\nVehicle Finance Commissions\nOn 25 October 2024, the Court of Appeal ruled against two other lenders in three cases involving commission disclosures related to payments to motor finance dealers. The judgment redefined the legal duties of dealers acting as credit brokers, requiring clear disclosure of, and consent to, the existence, nature and amount of any commission paid. The lenders successfully applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, which was heard in early April 2025, with the outcome on 1 August 2025.\nThe Supreme Court rejected the Court of Appeal's finding that car dealers were fiduciaries. Dealers arranging finance as part of a car sale were acting in their own commercial interest, not in single minded loyalty to the customer. Without a fiduciary duty, commission payments could not amount to secret bribes, and claims based on both fiduciary duty and bribery were rejected.\nIn one case (Johnson), the relationship was deemed unfair due to a range of factors, including a disproportionately large commission (55% of finance charge) which was not brought to his attention and a \"first refusal\" arrangement despite messaging to the customer that a panel was being used to find the best deal for them.\nOn 3 August 2025 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced its intention to consult on a compensation scheme. The FCA will publish its full consultation by early October 2025, and the consultation will be open for six weeks. The scope is proposed to cover unfair relationships based on the Supreme Court judgment. Any scheme will cover discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) and may extend to non-DCAs. The FCA will consider what size of commission may point to unfairness if not disclosed. The methodology for calculating redress will be informed by the degree of harm suffered by the customer. The scheme is proposed to cover agreements going back to 2007.\nAs previously stated, the Group has never entered into any discretionary commission arrangements on our Vehicle Finance products.\nThe Group's position is differentiated from the Johnson case on a number of grounds, including, but not limited to:\n1. The average commission of \u00a3695 paid as a percentage of the credit charge, at c.13% for the period 26 October 2013 to 25 October 2024 was much lower than the 55% in the Johnson case.\n2. All historical commissions were aligned with regulatory requirements with them being a flat fee or fixed percentage of the loan.\n3. Vanquis did not operate \"right of first refusal\" arrangements based on a review of introducer agreements.\n4. Customers were provided with signed pre-contractual documents, written in clear language, confirming a commission would be paid.\n5. Disclosures were better than regulatory requirements, including customers providing express consent to most credit agreements.\nFor the period 26 October 2013 to 25 October 2024, the Group had an immaterial number of cases where the commission paid as a percentage of the total credit exceeded 50%. Taking all factors into consideration, any payout on these contracts is still not considered probable.\nThe Group has assessed the requirement for a provision and as at 30 June 2025 no amounts have been recognised. This is due primarily to the conclusion of the review undertaken at 31 December 2024 for which the Supreme Court rulings on fiduciary duty and bribery have clarified the legal position on these matters. It also reflects the parameters referenced by the FCA in their consultation on a compensation scheme relating to unfair relationships. Vanquis consider its circumstances to be materially different and that any outflow is not considered probable.\n17. Post Balance Sheet events\nThe outcome from the Supreme Court judgment regarding motor finance commission disclosure practices on 1 August 2025 and the FCA's intention to consult on a motor finance compensation scheme announced on the 3 August 2025 have been considered in note 16.\nDirectors' responsibility statement\nThe directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, the unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 as contained in UK adopted IFRS, and that the interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.4R, DTR 4.2.7R and DTR 4.2.8R, namely:\n\u00b7\nAn indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the unaudited condensed interim financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nMaterial related party transactions that have occurred in the first six months of the financial year and any material changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report and financial statements.\nA list of current directors is maintained on the Vanquis Banking Group plc website:\nwww.vanquis.com\n. All directors were present throughout the six months ended 30 June 2025.\nThe maintenance and integrity of the Vanquis Banking Group website is the responsibility of the directors. The work carried out by the auditor does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditor accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the unaudited condensed interim financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.\nLegislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of unaudited condensed interim financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nBy order of the board\nIan McLaughlin - Chief Executive Officer Dave Watts - Chief Financial Officer\n6 August 2025\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
