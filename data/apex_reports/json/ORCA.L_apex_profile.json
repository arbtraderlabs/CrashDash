In planning its Pilot development, Orcadian has selected wind power to transform oil production into a cleaner and greener process. The Pilot project is moving towards approval and will be amongst the lowest carbon emitting oil production facilities in the world, despite being a viscous crude. Orcadian may be a small operator, but it is also nimble, and the Directors believe it has grasped opportunities that have eluded some of the much bigger companies. As we strike a balance between Net Zero and a sustainable energy supply, Orcadian intends to play its part to minimise the cost of Net Zero and to deliver reliable energy to the UK.\nOrcadian Energy (CNS) Ltd, Orcadian's operating subsidiary, was founded in 2014 and is the sole licensee of P2244, which contains 78.0 MMbbl of 2P Reserves in the Pilot discovery, and of P2482, which contain a further 52.2 MMbbl of 2C Contingent Resources in the Elke and Narwhal discoveries (as audited by Sproule, with both numbers modified to take into account the TGS royalty, see the CPR in the Company's Admission Document for more details). Within these licences there are also 118 MMbbl of unrisked Prospective Resources (modified for TGS royalty). These licences are in blocks 21/27a, 28/2a and 28/3a, and lie 150 kms due East of Aberdeen.\nPilot, which is the field with the largest reserves in Orcadian's portfolio, was discovered by PetroFina in 1989 and has been well appraised. In total five wells and two sidetracks were drilled on Pilot, including a relatively short horizontal well which produced over 1,800 bbls/day on test. Orcadian's proposed low emissions, field development plan for Pilot is based upon a Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO), with over thirty wells to be drilled by a Jack-up rig and provision of power from a floating wind turbine.\nOrcadian has entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Ping Petroleum UK plc (\"Ping\") which details the terms under which Ping will farm-in to the Pilot development project. Upon conclusion of this deal Orcadian would have an 18.75% stake in the Pilot development with all pre-first oil development costs paid by Ping.\nEmissions per barrel produced are expected to be about a tenth of the 2021 North Sea average, and less than half of the lowest emitting oil facility currently operating on the UKCS. On a global basis this places the Pilot field emissions at the low end of the lowest 5% of global oil production.\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

The key conditions relate to the balance of trade in hydrocarbons and emissions intensity of gas production relative to LNG imports.\nAs announced on 19 January 2023, the Company made three licence applications in the 33rd Oil and Gas Licensing Round, two in partnership with other companies and one on its own. The NSTA announced the award of 27 licences in a first batch of awards, from 115 applications, with 6 more blocks, which were ready to be offered, merged into five existing licences\n[2]\n. NSTA notes that all applications have been through the initial Habitat Regulation Assessment and the blocks awarded to date have been identified as not requiring further assessment. A decision on the other blocks will be made once the Habitat Regulation Assessment Further Appropriate Assessment process has been completed. Orcadian can confirm that no other company was awarded the blocks applied for by Orcadian, and that the Directors remain optimistic that the Company's applications will be successful.\nSteve Brown, Orcadian's CEO, said:\n\"\nWe are delighted to hear that the Government intends to legislate for annual oil and gas licensing rounds. We believe this puts a lid on the tired argument that domestic oil and gas production is inconsistent with our climate commitments.\n\"We believe new projects are the key to reducing the UK's emissions from producing the oil and gas that is needed for a secure transition. The NSTA sets industry stringent hurdles to be cleared before new projects can progress.\n\"In a world of flattening oil and gas demand, we believe it is imperative that we refresh the global oil supply with low emission barrels rather than prolonging the life of tired reservoirs with high emissions.\n\"Those who call for no new oil are calling for higher emissions, fewer jobs for UK workers, energy insecurity and seek to hammer ordinary folk with higher energy prices.\n\"\nFor further information on the Company please visit the Company's website:\nhttps://orcadian.energy\nContact:\nOrcadian Energy plc\n+ 44 20 7920 3150\nSteve Brown, CEO\nAlan Hume, CFO\nWH Ireland Limited\nKaty Mitchell/Andrew de Andrade\n+44 207 220 1666\nTavistock\n(PR)\n+ 44 20 7920 3150\nNick Elwes / Simon Hudson\norcadian@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout Orcadian Energy\nOrcadian is a\nNorth Sea focused, low emissions, oil and gas development company\n.

NSTA has indicated that Orcadian Energy will be offered a further licence in the Southern North Sea (\"SNS\") in addition to the two Central North Sea (\"CNS\") licences offered on 31 January 2024.\nSNS Licence\nThe SNS licence contains an existing discovery with a high inerts content (Earlham) and an exciting undrilled prospect (Clover). The Earlham discovery was made by well 50/26b-6 drilled in 1995 by Talisman, encountering gas in the Rotliegendes. This was then followed in 1996 by a long horizontal appraisal well drilled by BP, which tested at over 30 mmscf/day of gas. The test was curtailed when it was established that the gas contained 49% CO2 and 9% N2. Taking that into account, Orcadian estimate that the Earlham reservoir contains 114 bcf of sales gas (methane) on a P50 basis. Our preliminary development concept entails an offshore power station, to be connected to the grid via a wind farm substation, with integrated CO2 capture and storage. This concept would deliver a stable and reliable supply of electricity with near-zero emissions.\nCollaboration with the wind farm operator will be essential to deliver this project, and we look forward to discussing our plans with RWE who have recently acquired the rights to develop the Norfolk Boreas wind farm from Vattenfall.\nThe licence also contains a compelling gas prospect which the Company has named Clover, this is a four-way dip closure reservoired in Bunter sands, analogous to the nearby Orwell Field, that is now decommissioned having produced over 300 bcf of gas. Orcadian estimate that P50 recoverable resources in Clover amount to 153 bcf and the geological chance of success is estimated to be 38%.\nThe SNS licence covers blocks 49/25b, 50/21a, 49/30a and 50/26.\nSteve Brown, Orcadian's CEO, said:\n\"Following on from the very large viscous oil accumulation at Fynn, and the shallow gas prospects on the Mid North Sea High, we are delighted to have completed a hat-trick of licence awards with the SNS offer from the NSTA. The star of this licence is the Earlham discovery which we believe can be developed as a gas-to-wire scheme with integrated carbon capture. Such an approach means the project could reliably supply electricity to the UK grid with near-zero emissions. This is a project that anyone who is concerned with energy security, grid reliability, consumer bills, and emissions can get behind, and which demonstrates how our industry can adapt to a Net Zero world.\n\"In addition, there is also a cracking Bunter sand prospect which was cleaved in two by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1971, when they put a block boundary right down the middle of the Clover prospect. This is the first time in over fifty years that a single license group has the whole prospect in hand which will enhance any potential farm-out opportunities for the licence in the future.\"\nMap showing location of offered licence (green outline) and the Norfolk Boreas wind farm area.\nFor further information on the Company please visit the Company's website:\nhttps://orcadian.energy\nContact:\nOrcadian Energy plc\n+ 44 20 7920 3150\nSteve Brown, CEO\nAlan Hume, CFO\nZeus (Nomad and Joint Broker)\n+44 20 3829 5000\nDan Bate / Alex Campbell-Harris (Investment Banking)\nSimon Johnson (Corporate Broking)\nNovum (Joint Broker)\n+44 207 399 9425\nColin Rowbury / Jon Belliss\nTavistock (PR)\n+ 44 20 7920 3150\nNick Elwes / Simon Hudson\norcadian@tavistock.co.uk\nQualified Person's Statement\nPursuant to the requirements of the AIM Rules and in particular, the AIM Note for Mining and Oil and Gas Companies, Maurice Bamford has reviewed and approved the technical information and resource reporting contained in this announcement.\nMaurice has more than 34 years' experience in the oil & gas industry and 3 years in academia. He holds a BSc in Geology from Queens University Belfast and a PhD in Geology from the National University of Ireland. Maurice is a Fellow of the Geological Society, London, and a member of the Geoscience Energy Society of Great Britain. He is Exploration and Geoscience Manager at Orcadian Energy.\nAbout Orcadian Energy\nOrcadian is a North Sea focused, low emissions, oil and gas exploration and development company. Orcadian may be a small operator, but it is also nimble, and the Directors believe it has grasped opportunities that have eluded some of the much bigger companies. As we strike a balance between Net Zero and a sustainable energy supply, Orcadian intends to play its part to minimise the cost of Net Zero and to deliver reliable energy to the UK.\nOrcadian's key asset is the Pilot oilfield, Pilot was discovered by PetroFina in 1989 and has been well appraised. The field has excellent quality reservoir and contains 263MMbbl of a viscous oil ranging in gravity from 17\u00ba API in the South of the reservoir to 12\u00ba API in the North. In planning the Pilot development, Orcadian has selected polymer flooding and wind power to transform the production of viscous oil into a cleaner and greener process. Polymer significantly reduces fluid handling requirements and hence energy consumption as well as boosting recovery. Ithaca Energy, operator of the Captain field in the Inner Moray Firth, has enjoyed consistent success in applying polymer flood to the highly analogous Captain field. Following the recent farm-down of Pilot, the project is now under the stewardship of Ping Petroleum UK PLC (\"Ping\") and is intended to be amongst the lowest carbon emitting oil production facilities in the world.\nPing is progressing a low-emissions, phased, field development plan for Pilot based upon a polymer flood of the reservoir, a Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) and provision of power from a floating wind turbine or a local wind farm.\nOrcadian has an 18.75% fully carried interest in licence P2244 (block 21/27a) and a 100% interest in licence P2482 (blocks 28/2a and 28/3a). Ping is operator of P2244 and the Pilot development project. As noted above Orcadian has also been offered three licences in the 33rd licensing process and expects formal issues of these licences in due course.\nThe Mid-North Sea High licence contains shallow gas leads. Orcadian applied in partnership with Triangle Energy, an Australian listed energy company. Orcadian would be licence administrator and would hold 50% of the offered licence. The Mid-North Sea High licence covers blocks 29/16, 29/17, 29/18, 29/19, 29/21, 29/22, 29/23, 29/27 and 29/28.\nThe Fynn licence contains a very substantial heavy oil discovery. About 88% of the resource on a best technical case is estimated to lie within the area of the offered licence. Orcadian has been offered a 50% working interest in the Fynn licence to be operated by the Parkmead Group. The Fynn licence covers blocks 14/15a, 14/20d and 15/11a.\nOrcadian provides below a summary of resources across its licences and newly awarded licences, still to be formally issued. For licences P2244 (Pilot) and P2482 (Elke, Narwhal and Elke satellites) the volumes are based upon the CPR prepared by Sproule in April 2021 net of TGS royalty and including an estimate of the allocation of production as detailed in the Pilot SPA and JOA. For the prospects on the new licences, Fynn (Beauly), Lowlander & Midlander, Glenlough, Breckagh, Earlham and Clover the volumes are either Orcadian management estimates or Operator management estimates prepared in accordance with the reserve definitions guidelines defined in the SPE Petroleum Resources Management System 2018.\nAsset\nGross\nNet\nPRMS sub-class\nPhase & units\nCommercial risk factor\nLicence\n1C\n2C\n3C\n1C\n2C\n3C\nPilot*\n58.4\n78.8\n110.5\n9.8\n13.6\n19.7\nDevelopment pending\nOil, MMbbl\n100%\nP2244Source 2\nPilot periphery\n5.9\n9.8\n17.6\n1.1\n1.8\n3.3\nDevelopment unclarified\nOil, MMbbl\n80%\nP2244Source 2 & 7\nElke Main \u00a7\n26.0\n45.5\n94.9\n25.7\n45.0\n94.0\nDevelopment on hold\nOil, MMbbl\n79%\nP2482Source 3\nNarwhal\n4.3\n9.2\n17.6\n4.2\n9.1\n17.4\nDevelopment on hold\nOil, MMbbl\n79%\nP2482Source 1\nFynn (Beauly)^\n175.6\n292.3\n480.6\n77.3\n128.6\n211.5\nDevelopment unclarified\nOil, MMbbl\n25%\nP2634^Source 5 & 7\nLowlander & Midlander^\n17.5\n11.6\n31.9\n8.8\n5.8\n16.0\nDevelopment unclarified\nOil, MMbbl\n15%\nP2634^Source 6 & 7\nEarlham^\n12.5\n19.0\n29.0\n12.5\n19.0\n29.0\nDevelopment unclarified\nGas, MMboe\n67%\nOffer^Source 4\n75.0\n114.0\n174.0\n75.0\n114.0\n174.0\nGas, bcf\nTotal contingent resources\n223.0\nOil & gas, MMboe\nTotal contingent resources factored by commercial risk\n103.6\nOil & gas, MMboe\nAsset\nGross\nNet\nPRMS sub-class\nPhase & units\nGeological risk factor\nLicence\nLow\nBest\nHigh\nLow\nBest\nHigh\nElke Main - West(3C outline \u00a7)\n13.0\n22.8\n47.5\n12.9\n22.5\n47.0\nProspect\nOil, MMbbl\n90%\nP2482Source 3 & 7\nElke Updip\n5.5\n17.5\n39.0\n5.4\n17.3\n38.6\nProspect\nOil, MMbbl\n87%\nP2482Source 1\nElke Area 2\n4.2\n12.3\n25.4\n4.2\n12.2\n25.1\nProspect\nOil, MMbbl\n64%\nP2482Source 1\nClover^\n13.8\n25.5\n45.3\n13.8\n25.5\n45.3\nProspect\nGas, MMboe\n38%\nOffer^Source 4\n83.0\n153.0\n272.0\n83.0\n153.0\n272.0\nGas, bcf\nGlenlough^\n12.0\n21.8\n36.7\n6.0\n10.9\n18.3\nLead\nGas, MMboe\n31%\nP2650^Source 4\n72.0\n131.0\n220.0\n36.0\n65.5\n110.0\nGas, bcf\nUpper Breckagh^\n3.3\n5.5\n9.2\n1.7\n2.8\n4.6\nLead\nGas, MMboe\n55%\nP2650^Source 4\n20.0\n33.0\n55.0\n10.0\n16.5\n27.5\nGas, bcf\nLower Breckagh^\n9.5\n17.5\n30.3\n4.8\n8.8\n15.2\nLead\nGas, MMboe\n20%\nP2650^Source 4\n57.0\n105.0\n182.0\n28.5\n52.5\n91.0\nGas, bcf\nTotal prospective resources\n99.9\nOil & gas, MMboe\nTotal risked prospective resources\n59.5\nOil & gas, MMboe\nSource\n1\nSproule CPR 2021\n2\nSproule CPR 2021 - equity updated\n3\nSproule CPR 2021 - management modified\n4\nManagement estimate - Licence Application to NSTA\n5\nOperator estimate - as presented to NSTA\n6\nOperator - earlier Relinquishment Report & Licence Application - both for NSTA\n7\nOrcadian management estimate of risk factor\nNotes\n*\nPilot field net resources include a reduced revenue interest of 10% until the carry is repaid\n\u00a7\nElke high case is limited to the 2C outline as we have reclassified the 3C extension as the Elke Main West prospect\n^\nResources are on a licence which has been offered for award but which has not yet been signed\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
