These highly customized models mirror a broad spectrum of tumor molecular profiles and are tested through Vivan's state-of-the-art high-throughput platform, enabling rapid and scalable assessment of investigational compounds.\nGallium maltolate, a compound that has already shown promise in glioblastoma, will now be evaluated across a broad spectrum of tumor molecular profiles. The initial focus will be on colorectal cancer, while also extending to other challenging malignancies, including pancreatic, lung, and additional gastrointestinal cancers. The goal is to identify its therapeutic activity either as a single agent or in combination with existing drugs, potentially expanding its clinical utility.\nWith the Phase 1 trial in oral gallium maltolate (GaM) for adult glioblastoma now closed, Imaging Biometrics is evaluating next steps for clinical development. In parallel, the company is advancing preclinical research through Vivan Therapeutics' innovative fruit fly screening platform, which enables rapid assessment across diverse cancer types.\n\"This partnership with Vivan Therapeutics marks an exciting new chapter in the exploration of gallium maltolate's therapeutic potential,\" said Michael Schmainda, CEO of IB. \"Their unique fruit fly screening platform enables rapid, personalized testing that could accelerate the path to more effective cancer treatments involving GaM.\"\nLaura Towart, CEO of Vivan Therapeutics, added: \"We're pleased to employ our proprietary screening platform to assess gallium maltolate's potential across different cancer profiles. Our ultra-customized in vivo assays have consistently revealed promising therapeutic options, and we look forward to uncovering new possibilities for this compound in solid tumors.\"\nThe collaboration also establishes a framework for future joint development efforts, particularly around combination therapies. If the screening identifies compelling opportunities, both companies have agreed to pursue further co-development discussions.\n--ENDS--\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\u00a0(Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics LLC:\u00a0IB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Founded on technology developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (NY), Vivan's proprietary platform maps the full spectrum of tumor-driving genetic alterations and recreates them in ultra-customized fruit fly in vivo models. This enables rapid, high-throughput screening of thousands of approved and investigational drugs, alone or in combination, to identify the most effective therapies for each individual.\nBeyond patient care, Vivan's platform supports biopharma partners in drug discovery and development. By tailoring investigational treatments to specific genetic signatures, the technology provides unprecedented opportunities for patient stratification and precision-driven clinical trial design. The same in vivo high-throughput platform is also applied across a range of genetic diseases, advancing discovery internally and in collaboration with global biopharma clients.\nFor general information, visit\u00a0www.vivantx.com\u00a0.\nMedia Contacts:\nImaging Biometrics, LLC\nMichael Schmainda+1 262-439-8252mike@imagingbiometrics.com\nVivan Therapeutics\nLaura Towart+44 7496375189laura@vivantx.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
