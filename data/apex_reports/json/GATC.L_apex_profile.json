The Deferred Consideration is payable over the next four years, subject to minimum performance criteria being achieved by Infosec within each year.\nInfosec is a specialist cyber security recruitment consultancy, based in Cheltenham, UK. Founded in 2009, the business works with clients across a variety of sectors providing cyber and information security specialists.\nIn the year to 31 March 2025, Infosec had net fee income of \u00a31.5m, generating an adjusted operating profit of \u00a30.4m and had net assets of \u00a31.0m as at 31 March 2025.\nOutlook\nWhilst market conditions\ncontinue to be challenging, Gattaca remains focused on its core markets, continuing to improve consultant net fee productivity and the Group's back-office efficiency. As a result of continued demand and enhanced operational efficiencies, the Board expects the Company to perform in line with current market expectation of \u00a34m underlying Profit before Tax for FY26.\nCommenting, Matthew Wragg, Chief Executive Officer of Gattaca, said:\n\"We are pleased to report a solid FY25 performance, achieved through proactive management of the market challenges. With a great team we are starting to see the tangible results of our strategy and focus on markets where we see significant potential.\nWe have retained our customer base, further strengthened our capability, improved our performance per head, continued to grow our contractor book and are seeing the results of our strategic investments.\n\"I am also very pleased to be welcoming new colleagues from Infosec to the Group. Cyber security has never been so relevant and the demand to protect national security, businesses, customers and our data will continue to grow. The addition of this expert capability to the Group will provide a bigger platform for our new colleagues to positively impact the market and enable us to further enhance our services to our extensive customer base across national critical infrastructure, defence and beyond.\"\n1.
