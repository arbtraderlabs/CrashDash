Asset Match, a firm authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ((FRN 579310), will operate an electronic off-market dealing facility for the Ordinary Shares. This facility will allow existing holders of ordinary shares in the Company (\"Shareholders\") and new investors to trade ordinary shares by matching buyers and sellers through periodic auctions.\nNew investors and existing Shareholders are encouraged to register on\nwww.assetmatch.com\nand add Tissue Regenix\nto their 'Watchlist' to continue to receive Company updates and auction/price information. Please note the Tissue Regenix page will go live on Asset Match on\n7 January 2026.\nThe Asset Match trading facility operates under its own code of practice which governs the behaviour of participants and the running of the periodic auctions. Asset Match operates an open auction system where volumes of bids and offers at different prices are displayed on its website together with the closing date of the auction. At the end of each auction period, Asset Match passes this information through a non-discretionary algorithm that determines a \"market-derived\" share price based on supply and demand and allocates transactions accordingly. Bids and offers may be made and withdrawn at any time before the closing date of each auction.\nShareholders will continue to be able to hold their shares in uncertificated form (i.e. in CREST) and should check with their existing stockbroker whether they are willing or able to trade in unquoted shares. Shareholders wishing to trade shares through Asset Match must do so through a stockbroker. A comprehensive list of stockbrokers who have signed up to access the Asset Match platform is available on request by emailing dealing@assetmatch.com.\nFull details will be made available to Shareholders on the Company's website at\nwww.tissueregenix.com\nand directly by letter or e-mail (where appropriate). Shareholders may contact Asset Match in relation to any queries regarding trading via the secondary market trading facility by emailing dealing@assetmatch.com.\nFor more information, please contact:\nTissue Regenix Group plc\nJay LeCoque, Executive Chairman\nvia Walbrook PR\nAsset Match Limited\n+44(0) 207 248 2788\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR and IR)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or TissueRegenix@walbrookpr.com\nAlice Woodings / Paul McManus\nMob: +44 (0)7407 804 654 / +44 (0)7980 541 893\nAbout Tissue Regenix (www.tissueregenix.com)\nTissue Regenix is a leading medical device company in regenerative medicine.
