The rig has now moved to the next pad where drilling has already commenced. The next set of assay results are expected in early February.\nThe rig\u2019s commissioning was completed efficiently and included the integration of a Moroccan-sourced water recycling system.\nKey Highlights\nFirst core has been recovered at Zone 1 North from the Company\u2019s recently commissioned diamond rig\nVisible copper mineralisation observed in the core, consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations and many of the previous holes\nCompany-owned drill rig expected to underpin lower drilling costs and improved drilling flexibility\nThe drilling team has provided very positive feedback about the Multi-Power Discovery HD rig\nRig\u2019s capability provides optionality to test deeper targets, including the potential source of mineralised rhyolite\nStrong, experienced Morocco-based team positioned to support an accelerated programme through 2026\nFig.1 First drill core from recently commissioned diamond drilling rig with observable copper mineralisation\nSource: Company\nCharlie Long CEO commented:\n\u201cThe commissioning of our company owned drill rig is a genuine step-forward for the project.\nHaving this capability in-house gives us far greater control over the drill programme and paves the way for reduced drilling costs.\nOur drilling team is reporting that the Multi-Power Discovery HD is powerful, productive and straightforward to operate, making rapid progress through carbonate and igneous rocks. Importantly it also provides us with the capability to explore deeper targets as required, including as we continue hunting for the source of the mineralised rhyolite.\nCredit goes to our Moroccan drilling team, expertly led by our COO Noureddine, and our dedicated JV partner, who commissioned the rig smoothly and installed a locally sourced water recycling system without issue. Morrocco continues to stand out as highly capable mining jurisdiction, not only for its regulatory environment but the depth of practical expertise available on the ground.\nThat expertise will be increasingly important through 2026, as we progress Agadir Melloul towards production, supported by Moroccan experts with direct experience of developing and building multiple mines, including copper floatation operations\u201d\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe technical exploration and mining information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Robert Nigel Chapman.

          "content": "7 Jan 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 3165S\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\n07 January 2025\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\n('CMR' or the 'Company')\nCommodities Trading update\nCritical Mineral Resources plc ('CMR' or the 'Company'), the developer of advanced metal mining projects and commodities trading in Morocco is pleased to\nprovide a summary of recent progress and its proposals to further advance and develop the\ncommodities trading business unit of the Company during 2025.\nTrading update and outlook\nCMR has now undertaken several trades since early December\nin a range of base and speciality metals\n. This has led to multiple new trading opportunities and the Company now intends\nto expand this profitable business during 2025. The Joint Venture's focus has been on low-risk and short-term trading opportunities in order to provide a proof of concept. Whilst a conservative approach to risk will continue, the near-term objective is now to scale up the trading business with multiple small mines that have potential for good tonnage and high-grade products in a range of metals and potentially industrial minerals. With this is mind the management have commenced discussions with a number of potential providers for additional working capital.\nCharlie Long (CEO) commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by the achievement of our commodities trading business in such a short timescale. Given our Moroccan team's metals trading background, we have known of the potential for some time and always planned to enter the space. The benefits of having a local JV partner with a long history of trading in metals and industrial minerals is now very clear. As we continue to gain traction, we are investigating sources of non-dilutive capital that would enable a step-change in scale. That said, our organic growth trajectory is working extremely well and we will not take undue risk. Further details of our expansion plans will be provided to shareholders in due course\".\nSmall-scale mining and our social license\nMorocco's artisanal and small-scale operators work alongside larger industrial scale mines. Our partners have unrivalled knowledge of the cultural practices of the rural mining economy and a deep understanding of Moroccan commodities commerce. This gives CMR a distinct competitive advantage.\nDespite being the core fabric of the sector, small scale mining in Morocco remains undercapitalised and will benefit from actors such as CMR with high EISA standards.\nThe commercial objective is to create an efficient mine to end-user pathway that is beneficial to all parties by developing a profitable business while maintaining these high social standards and building long term relationships.\nBackground\nDue to Morocco's stability and status as a favoured trading partner of the EU, the US and China, there is extremely good demand for Moroccan-produced exports including metal concentrates and critical materials.\nMorocco is a tier one jurisdiction for metals exploration, development and mining. In the well respected and most recent 2023 Fraser Institute's latest mining survey, Morocco ranks 27th in the 'Investment Attractiveness Index' globally and 2nd in Africa for both overall investment and policy. In the Fraser 'Policy Perception Index', Morocco's score increased by 6 points and now ranks 12th (out of 86 jurisdictions), an improvement from 17th (of 62 jurisdictions) in 2022.\nMorocco's mining industry includes phosphate (OCP Group), manganese, barite (chemical and petroleum grades), lead-zinc, copper-silver, gold-silver (Aya Gold & Silver), oligiste, cobalt and gold. There is also production of antimony, tungsten and industrial minerals such as feldspar, fluorspar and gypsum. The map below shows the main mine regions and deep-water ports that handle the majority of Morocco's exported metals and minerals.\nPartnership in Morocco\nIn recent months the Company has taken a series of initiatives to create a self-sufficient and increasingly profitable commodities trading business. Central to this has been the creation of a formal profit-sharing partnership with an established Moroccan trading entity to identify, acquire and trade a range of metals and industrial minerals. Our partners have over a decade experience in sourcing and, where necessary, upgrading crude mineral ores and semi-processed raw materials secured from the small-scale mines, artisanal miners and aggregators.\nFig 1: Morocco mining map\nSource: Company\nCONTACT:\nCritical Mineral Resources PLC\nCharles Long,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer\ninfo@cmrplc.com\nNovum Securities\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nNotes To Editors\nCritical Mineral Resources (CMR) PLC is an exploration and development company focused on developing assets that produce key commodities for the global economy including those essential for electrification and the clean energy revolution.
