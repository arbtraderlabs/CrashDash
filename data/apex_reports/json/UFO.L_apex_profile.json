The Company follows a balanced strategy of advancing and strengthening its asset portfolio through targeted technical work and project development, while evaluating partnerships, joint ventures, and selective monetisation opportunities that are value-enhancing for shareholders. At the same time, Alien will continue to consider opportunities to expand our asset base through carefully selected acquisition opportunities which meet the Board's prudent criteria.\nAlien's principal focus is the advancement and development of its 90%-owned Hancock Iron Ore Project in the central Pilbara region of Western Australia. The Hancock tenements contain a JORC-compliant resource of 8.4Mt at 60% Fe and offer significant exploration upside,\nwhich is targeted to deliver a mining operation of 2Mtpa for 10 years\n. The Project benefits from direct access to the Great Northern Highway, providing a route to export facilities at Port Hedland, one of the world's largest iron ore export hubs. Alien also holds exploration interests in the Brockman and Vivash iron ore projects in the West Pilbara.\nAlien additionally retains exposure to two advanced precious and base metal assets in the Pilbara. At Munni Munni, one of Australia's largest PGM systems hosting a historic resource of 2.2Moz PGM (Palladium, Platinum, and Rhodium) and gold, the Company has entered into a conditional joint venture with GreenTech Metals Ltd, under which Alien will retain a 30% interest, free carried to the completion of a bankable feasibility study. Alien also retains a 30% interest in the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project through a joint venture with West Coast Silver Limited, which encompasses Elizabeth Hill Mining Lease and exploration tenements surrounding the historical silver mine, which has produced some of Australia's highest-grade silver ore during the late 1990s.\nAppendix A - ASX: WCE ANNOUNCEMENT\nPlacement Completion of $3.2 million\nWest Coast Silver Limited (ASX: WCE) (West Coast Silver or the Company) is pleased to advise it has issued 16,842,105 fully paid ordinary shares as completion of the Placement announced on 31 December 2025.\nThe updated fully paid ordinary shares is summarised below.\nSecurities\nNumber of securities\nFully paid ordinary shares\n*\n350,707,258\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.40 each expiring 21 April 2026\n2,000,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.18 each expiring 30 October 2026\n3,525,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.12 each expiring 23 March 2027\n5,000,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.12 each expiring 30 July 2027\n100,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.20 each expiring 23 September 2027\n5,000,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.117 each expiring 25 November 2027\n1,200,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.04 each expiring 18 May 2028\n9,750,000\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.155 each expiring 24 September 2028\n6,775,142\nUnlisted options exercisable at $0.25 each expiring 19 November 2028\n1,500,000\nPerformance rights expiring 21 April 2027\n5,000,000\nPerformance rights expiring 18 May 2028\n10,000,000\nPerformance rights expiring 19 November 2028\n2,000,000\n* Refer to the Appendix 2As lodged on ASX on 7 January 2026 for further information.\nThis ASX announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Directors of West Coast Silver Limited.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBruce Garlick\nExecutive Director\nWest Coast Silver Limited\nE: info@westcoastsilver.com.au\nThe Elizabeth Hill Project\nElizabeth Hill is historically one of Australia's highest grade silver projects and has a proven production history outlined below:\n\u2022\nHigh grades enabled low processing tonnes: 1.2Moz of silver was produced from just 16,830t of ore at a head grade of 2,194g/t (70.5 oz/t Ag)\n[1]\n.\n\u2022\nPrevious mining operation ceased in 2000: because of low silver prices (US$5)\n[2]\n.\n\u2022\nSimplistic historical processing technique: native silver was recovered via low-cost gravity separation techniques.\n\u2022\nUntapped potential remains in ground with deposit open at depth and recent consolidation of land package offers potential to discover more Elizabeth Hill style deposits.\n\u2022\nTier 1 Mining Jurisdiction located on a mining lease with potential processing option at the nearby Radio Hill site. Radio Hill is a third-party-owned processing facility; WCE has no current agreement in place.\"\nFigure 1: Tenement Location.\nThrough the consolidation of the surrounding land packages into a single contiguous 180km2 package significant exploration and growth potential exists both near mine and regionally. The land package holds a significant portion of the Munni Munni fault system, and other fault systems subparallel to the Munni Munni fault system, which are considered prospective for Elizabeth Hill look-a-like silver deposits.\n[1]\nWAMEX Annual Report,1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, Elizabeth Hill Silver Project, Global Strategic Metals NL, p16\n[2]\nwww.kitco.com/charts/silver\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

To intersect Native silver in two drill holes and silver-bearing minerals in another two holes\nclose to surface is a tremendous result and validates our belief in the near-surface potential at Elizabeth Hill.\nDrill Hole Mineralisation: Visual Observations/pXRF\nThroughout the drilling process, all drill holes undergo geological logging to assess lithology, alteration, and mineralisation. In four of the initial five completed drillholes, native silver and/or silver minerals were identified and verified using a Vanta portable XRF (\"pXRF\") device. It is important to note that while pXRF readings provide valuable insights, they should not be considered a substitute for thorough laboratory analysis. These readings reflect elemental concentrations at specific locations rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the entire rock sample.\nWCE emphasises that visual estimates of mineral abundance should not be regarded as a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses, particularly when concentrations or grades are of primary economic significance. Furthermore, visual estimates do not yield information concerning impurities or detrimental physical properties that are pertinent to valuations.\nDescription of silver mineralisation\nDrill hole 25WCDD014\nDiamond drill hole 25WCDD014 contained three intervals of native silver mineralisation identified by geological logging and confirmed by pXRF analysis (Appendix 2). The geologically logged intervals of native silver mineralisation occur within the following intervals of the core photos below:\n\u00b7\n53.57m to 54.07m - 1% to 2% observed native silver (Figure 2).\n\u00b7\n66.24m to 66.42m - 1% observed native silver (Figure 3).\n\u00b7\n74.52m to 74.95m - 1% observed native silver (Figure 4).\nFigure 2:\nPhotograph of cut half HQ3 drill core (25WCDD014) from 53.45m to 54.18m showing 2mm to 4mm grains of native silver hosted within and adjacent to 1cm to 3cm thick carbonate veins in an ultramafic host rock. The native silver content is estimated at 1% to 2% by volume.\nFigure\n3\n:\nPhotograph of cut half HQ3 drill core (25WCDD014) from 65.96m to 66.60m showing 1% visually estimated, 2mm to 3mm long native silver grains hosted in and adjacent to 1cm to 10cm thick carbonate veins in an ultramafic host rock.\nFigure\n4\n:\nPhotograph of cut half HQ3 drill core (25WCDD014) from 74.42m to 75.11m showing 1% visually estimated, 2mm to 4mm long native silver grains hosted within and adjacent to 1cm to 3cm thick carbonate veins in an ultramafic host rock.\nDrill hole 25WCDD013\nDiamond drill hole 25WCDD013 contained approximately 5%, brown, oxidised carbonate-quartz veins, up to 5cm wide, from 14.80m to 16.60m depth (Figure 5). Within and adjacent to these veins, black, secondary minerals (1%), ranging from1mm to 2mm in size, were identified and have been confirmed by pXRF to contain silver (Appendix 2).\nFigure\n5:\nPhotograph of HQ3 diamond drill core (25WCDD013) from 14.48m to 17.65m showing several, up to 5cm wide, carbonate-quartz veins with 1mm to 2mm black silver-bearing minerals (1%) confirmed by pXRF in moderately weathered ultramafic host rock.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nIt is important to note that while pXRF readings provide valuable insights, they should not be considered a substitute for thorough laboratory analysis. These readings reflect elemental concentrations at specific locations rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the entire rock sample.\nWCE emphasises that visual estimates of mineral abundance should not be regarded as a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses, particularly when concentrations or grades are of primary economic significance. Furthermore, visual estimates do not yield information concerning impurities or detrimental physical properties that are pertinent to valuations.\nDrill hole 25WCDD016\nDiamond drill hole 25WCDD016 showed black oxidised minerals up to 2cm long and approximately 1% of the breccia from 44.59m to 44.61m (Figure 6). These minerals are hosted in a carbonate-matrix breccia and pXRF confirmed the presence of silver in this mineral (Appendix 2).\nFigure\n6:\nPhotograph of HQ3 diamond drill core (25WCDD016) from 44.56m to 44.75m showing several up to 2cm long black minerals from 44.59m to 44.61m forming approximately 1% of the breccia. These minerals are hosted in a carbonate-matrix breccia and pXRF confirmed the presence of silver in the black mineral.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nIt is important to note that while pXRF readings provide valuable insights, they should not be considered a substitute for thorough laboratory analysis. These readings reflect elemental concentrations at specific locations rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the entire rock sample.\nWCE emphasises that visual estimates of mineral abundance should not be regarded as a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses, particularly when concentrations or grades are of primary economic significance. Furthermore, visual estimates do not yield information concerning impurities or detrimental physical properties that are pertinent to valuations.\nDrill hole 25WCDD017\nDiamond drill hole 25WCDD017 contained trace amounts of observed native silver, occurring as 1mm to 2mm grains at 43.61m within a quartz vein in a late fracture (Figure 7), and were confirmed by pXRF (Appendix 2).\nFigure\n7\n. Photograph of HQ3 diamond drill core (25WCDD017) from 43.58m to 43.82m showing several up to 2mm wide native silver grains (<0.5%) confirmed by pXRF within a massive quartz vein.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nIt is important to note that while pXRF readings provide valuable insights, they should not be considered a substitute for thorough laboratory analysis. These readings reflect elemental concentrations at specific locations rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the entire rock sample.\nWCE emphasises that visual estimates of mineral abundance should not be regarded as a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses, particularly when concentrations or grades are of primary economic significance. Furthermore, visual estimates do not yield information concerning impurities or detrimental physical properties that are pertinent to valuations.\nDrill hole 25WCDD015\nDiamond drill hole 25WCDD015 did not contain any observable silver mineralisation and no significant silver was detected in the pXRF (Appendix 2). Laboratory analysis is required to determine the presence or absence of silver in this drill hole.\nDrill Plan and location of silver mineralisation\nDrill holes were planned to intersect and verify near surface mineralisation in historical drill holes at the northern end of previous underground workings (Figure 8).\nFigure\n8\n.\nMap showing the geological setting, location of drill holes which contained native silver and silver oxide and sulphide minerals and selected historical drill results\nNote: Call out results in\nFigure 8\nhave previously been shown in ASX Announcement dated 15 October 2025\nCross Sections and location of silver mineralisation\nDrill holes 25WCDD013 & 25WCDD014\nThese drill holes were targeting the prospective interaction of the Munni Munni fault and the granite/ultramafic contact, as well as targeting mineralisation at the top of the historical Elizabeth Hill mine sequence (Figure 9).\nFigure\n9\n:\nCross section with historical drilling and recently completed drill holes. Diamond drill hole 25WCDD014 terminated at the top of historical underground workings\nDrill hole 25WCDD016\nThis drill hole was targeting the prospective interaction of the Munni Munni fault and granite/ultramafic contact in the northern up plunge position representing the oxide component of the deeper, native silver and silver sulphide mineralisation (Figure 10).\nFigure\n10\n.\nCross section with historical drilling and recently completed drill hole 25WCDD016\nDrill hole 25WCDD017\nThis drill hole was targeted to intersect the prospective ultramafic rock and granite contact as well as the Munni Munni fault above the historical underground workings (Figure 11). Drill hole 25WCDD017 was designed to twin historical reverse circulation percussion drill hole EC100 and verify its reported mineralisation (EC100: 14m @ 404g/t Ag from 28m; refer to ASX Announcement dated 16th July 2025).\nFigure\n11\n:\nCross section with historical drilling and recently completed drill hole 25WCDD017\nDrill hole 25WCDD015\nDrill hole 25WCDD015 intersected the Munni Munni fault and the contact between ultramafic rock and granite (Figure 12). Although no visible silver mineralisation was observed during geological logging anomalous Ag and Pb was reported in spot pXRF analyses in the down hole interval 51.18m to 59.36m. The location of this interval is consistent with mineralisation reported in nearby historic drill holes(Figure 12). The subsequent assaying of the core from this drill hole will determine the presence and extent of any silver or any associated mineralisation within this zone.\nFigure\n12\n:\nCross section with historical drilling and recently completed drill hole 25WCDD015\nLaboratory Testing\nCore from the first three holes has been cut, and half-core has been sampled and dispatched for laboratory analysis. Core cutting and sampling activities are continuing, with analytical results expected mid-December 2025 to early January 2026\u00a0(indicative).\nOngoing drilling, sampling and submission will vary depending on drilling progress.\nResult timeframes may vary pending on laboratory analysis requirements for further analysis of any over-grade silver mineralisation.\nSelected samples have been submitted for expediated laboratory processing.\nThe Elizabeth Hill Project\nElizabeth Hill is historically one of Australia's highest grade silver projects and has a proven production history outlined below:\n\u2022\nHigh grades enabled low processing tonnes: 1.2Moz of silver was produced from just 16,830t of ore at a head grade of 2,194g/t (70.5 oz/t Ag)\n[2]\n.\n\u2022\nPrevious mining operation ceased in 2000: because of low silver prices (US$5)\n[3]\n.\n\u2022\nSimplistic historical processing technique: native silver was recovered via low-cost gravity separation techniques.\n\u2022\nUntapped potential remains in ground with deposit open at depth and recent consolidation of land package offers potential to discover more Elizabeth Hill style deposits.\n\u2022\nTier 1 Mining Jurisdiction located on a mining lease with potential processing option at the nearby Radio Hill site. Radio Hill is a third-party-owned processing facility; WCE has no current agreement in place.\"\nFigure 6\n: Tenement Location\nThrough the consolidation of the surrounding land packages into a single contiguous 180km2 package significant exploration and growth potential exists both near mine and regionally. The land package holds a significant portion of the Munni Munni fault system, and other fault systems subparallel to the Munni Munni fault system, which are considered prospective for Elizabeth Hill look-a-like silver deposits.\nAppendix 1: Drill hole Collar Details\nDrill Hole ID\nEasting (m)\nNorthing (m)\nRL (mASL)\nAzimuth (\u00b0)\nDip(\u00b0)\nPlanned Depth (m)\nDrilled Depth (m)\nNotes\nPlanned Hole 1\n487020\n7667955\n86.53\n270\n-60\n30\n0\nPlanned location Not yet drilled\n25WCDD019\n487030\n7667955\n86.62\n270\n-60\n30.4\nLogging in progress\n25WCDD021\n487045\n7667955\n86.77\n270\n-60\n65\n0\nDrilling in progress\n25WCDD016\n487051\n7667945\n87.34\n270\n-60\n64.9\ncomplete\n25WCDD015\n487055\n7667930\n88.47\n270\n-60\n76.9\ncomplete\nPlanned Hole 6\n487068\n7667930\n89.52\n270\n-60\n100\n0\nPlanned location Not yet drilled\n25WCDD013\n487027\n7667920\n87.44\n270\n-60\n38.9\ncomplete\n25WCDD014\n487057\n7667920\n89.27\n270\n-60\n76.4\ncomplete\n25WCDD018\n487027\n7667910\n87.5\n270\n-60\n33.5\nLogging in progress\n25WCDD017\n487040\n7667910\n88.2\n270\n-60\n66.0\ncomplete\nPlanned Hole 11\n487030\n7667900\n87.49\n270\n-60\n60\n0\nPlanned location Not yet drilled\nPlanned Hole 12\n487047\n7667900\n88.74\n270\n-60\n90\n0\nPlanned location Not yet drilled\nPlanned Hole 13\n487110\n7667821\n91.73\n270\n-60\n205\n0\nPlanned location Not yet drilled\nPlanned Hole 14\n487137\n7667822\n91.74\n270\n-56\n225\n0\nDepends on results of planned drill hole 13\n25WCDD020\n487030\n7667945\n87.34\n270\n-60\n47.0\nLogging in progress\nAppendix 2: Portable XRF Results\nGeological Log\nPortable XRF\nHole_ID\nDepth From (m)\nDepth To (m)\nInterval (m)\nMin 1 type\nMin 1 (%)\nComments\nPoint Location Depth\nInterpreted lithology or minerals\nAg (g/t)\nPb (g/t)\nS (g/t)\nNi (g/t)\nCu (g/t)\n25WCDD013\n0.00\n0.27\n0.27\nColluvial soil\n1.00\nWeathered pyroxenite\n9\n<LOD\n752\n1,291\n649\n25WCDD013\n0.27\n4.07\n3.80\nWeakly weathered pyroxenite, ferruginisation along fractures\n2.00\nWeathered pyroxenite\n8\n<LOD\n<LOD\n1,800\n1,642\n25WCDD013\n3.00\nWeathered pyroxenite\n<LOD\n<LOD\n<LOD\n1,038\n856\n25WCDD013\n4.00\nWeathered pyroxenite\n9\n55\n<LOD\n1,389\n258\n25WCDD013\n4.07\n5.29\n1.22\nsi\n5.00\nPyroxenite with several up to 10cm granite xenoliths;

These readings reflect elemental concentrations at specific locations rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the entire rock sample.\nWCE emphasises that visual estimates of mineral abundance should not be regarded as a proxy or substitute for laboratory analyses, particularly when concentrations or grades are of primary economic significance. Furthermore, visual estimates do not yield information concerning impurities or detrimental physical properties that are pertinent to valuations.\nNotes:\nAppendix 3: JORC Code, 2012 - Table 1 - Elizabeth Hill Diamond Drill Program, October 2025\nSection 1 Sampling Techniques and Data\n(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nSampling techniques\n\u00b7\nNature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.\n\u00b7\nInclude reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.\n\u00b7\nAspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.\n\u00b7\nIn cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.\n\u00b7\nPortable XRF (pXRF) readings have been recorded on core samples in zones which have been identified to potentially contain mineralisation by visual logging. The small (<8mm) pXRF beam has been aimed at the minerals of interest to take 1 reading to confirm/or falsify the presence of silver bearing minerals or other oxide and/or sulphide minerals to assist with the logging and sampling of the drill core.\n\u00b7\npXRF does not record temperature readings but ambient climate temperatures range from 27-40 deg Celsius.\n\u00b7\nPortable XRF is calibrated daily along with Certified Reference Material (CRM) checks during analysis.\nDrilling techniques\n\u00b7\nDrill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).\n\u00b7\nDrilling was undertaken with a track-mounted LF90 diamond core drill rig capable of drilling HQ core to 600m. Core was recovered in a triple tube. All the core in this ongoing program is to be drilled HQ3.\n\u00b7\nCore is orientated using Reflex ACT III HQ tool.\n\u00b7\nDrillhole collars were surveyed using an IMDEX TN14 Gyro and Differential GPS.\n\u00b7\nA Reflex Omni X-42 North Seeking Gyro is used for downhole surveying of the drill holes and is calibrated prior to use, with readings taken at approximately every 5m on the in and out run.\nDrill sample recovery\n\u00b7\nMethod of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.\n\u00b7\nMeasures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.\n\u00b7\nCore recovery was systematically recorded from the commencement of diamond coring to the end of hole, by reconciling against driller depth blocks, production plods and knowledge obtained from visual inspection.\n\u00b7\nCore recoveries typically averaged above 90% with isolated minor zones of lessor recovery.\n\u00b7\nSamples are yet to be submitted to the laboratory for analysis and any relationship between core recovery and grade has yet to be determined. There is no reason to expect any sampling bias.\n\u00b7\nDetailed core recovery data is maintained throughout the program as part of the geotechnical logging.\nLogging\n\u00b7\nWhether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.\n\u00b7\nWhether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.\n\u00b7\nThe total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.\n\u00b7\nDiamond drill core is orientated and geologically and geotechnically logged for the entire drill hole by an experienced team of geologists and the data stored in a database.\n\u00b7\nAll core logging is both qualitative and quantitative in nature.\n\u00b7\nPhotographs are taken prior to the cutting and sampling of the core; core is wetted to improve the visibility of features in the photographs.\nSubsampling techniques and sample preparation\n\u00b7\nIf core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.\n\u00b7\nIf non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.\n\u00b7\nFor all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.\n\u00b7\nQuality control procedures adopted for all subsampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.\n\u00b7\nMeasures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.\n\u00b7\nWhether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.\n\u00b7\nNo new drill sample assay results are being reported. The portable XRF analyses are based on individual readings on minerals taken on the core in zones where visual logging identified the potential presence of mineralisation minerals. The analyses were on core in the core trays and was to assist with the identification of minerals for the geological core logging and sampling.\n\u00b7\npXRF QAQC includes daily calibration and analysing a CRM standard, every 20 samples.\n\u00b7\nThe CRM used was OREAS 133A.\n\u00b7\npXRF analysis may introduce some sample variability and pXRF results are regarded as qualitative at this stage.\n\u00b7\n30 second readings were undertaken on minerals of interest.\n\u00b7\npXRF readings are only performed on dry drill core.\nQuality of assay data and laboratory tests\n\u00b7\nThe nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.\n\u00b7\nFor geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.\n\u00b7\nNature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g., standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e., lack of bias) and precision have been established.\n\u00b7\nThe pXRF is an Olympus Vanta with the latest 2025 software and is calibrated daily. Analysis method uses 3 beam analysis set to 10 sec per beam for a 30 second read time.\n\u00b7\nCRM is analysed every 20 samples and has shown good repeatability.\nVerification of sampling and assaying\n\u00b7\nThe verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.\n\u00b7\nThe use of twinned holes.\n\u00b7\nDocumentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.\n\u00b7\nDiscuss any adjustment to assay data.\n\u00b7\npXRF data is exported digitally from devices for import into a digital database.\n\u00b7\nNo changes or calibrations have been applied to the pXRF data.\n\u00b7\nThe current drill program is aimed to twin several historical drill holes to verify grade reported for the historical drill holes.\nLocation of data points\n\u00b7\nAccuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.\n\u00b7\nSpecification of the grid system used.\n\u00b7\nQuality and adequacy of topographic control.\n\u00b7\n2025 drill holes are located using a Differential GPS (DGPS), with accuracy to within 20cm for northing and easting. Historical collars have been surveyed by DGPS in instances where collars have been identified.\n\u00b7\n2025 drilling uses a downhole north seeking gyro for surveys that provides continuous readings in and out of the drill hole. The data is uploaded into a data base for storage.\n\u00b7\nA 0.5m DTM is used for topographic control.\n\u00b7\nData has been collected in GDA94/MGA Zone 50.\nData spacing and distribution\n\u00b7\nData spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u00b7\nWhether the data spacing, and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.\n\u00b7\nWhether sample compositing has been applied.\n\u00b7\npXRF data have only been used to identify minerals and assist logging and sampling of the core.\n\u00b7\nSamples will be submitted for laboratory analysis and no assay results are reported in this release.\nOrientation of data in relation to geological structure\n\u00b7\nWhether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.\n\u00b7\nIf the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralized structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.\n\u00b7\nThe drilling has an average dip of approximately -60\u00b0 across the program. The dip is designed to intersect the mineralisation most effectively and be able to penetrate the mineralised envelope fully, allowing calculation of 'true thicknesses' at the completion of the drill program. Currently described logged intersections do not represent true thickness.\n\u00b7\nAngled drilling is being used to investigate cross-cutting mineralised structures, with assessment ongoing.\n\u00b7\nThe drill orientation is not expected to have introduced any sampling bias.\nSample security\n\u00b7\nThe measures taken to ensure sample security.\n\u00b7\nNot relevant for portable XRF analysis taken on site. No samples have yet been dispatched for laboratory analysis.\nAudits or reviews\n\u00b7\nThe results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.\n\u00b7\nNo audits or reviews of the portable XRF sampling techniques and data has taken place. pXRF results are preliminary only, and only laboratory assays will be used as quantitative analysis and in Mineral Resource calculations.\nSection 2 Reporting of Exploration Results\n(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section.)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nMineral tenement and land tenure status\n\u00b7\nType, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings.\n\u00b7\nThe security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.\n\u00b7\nThe results reported in this announcement refer to core from holes drilled wholly on M47/342.\n\u00b7\nThe tenement lies within the Ngarluma Native Title claim.\n\u00b7\nThe tenement is in good standing with no known impediments.\nExploration done by other parties\n\u00b7\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\n\u00b7\nThe Elizabeth Hill deposit and adjoining area has been explored for Ni, Cu, PGM, base metals, Li and Ag mineralisation since 1968 when US Steel International Inc explored the area for base metals and nickel.\n\u00b7\nMassive silver was discovered in ~1994-1995 by Legend mining NL in a percussion hole drilling program. Further drilling followed and in 1997 an exploration shaft and drive was sunk by East Coast Minerals NL.\n\u00b7\nUnderground mining at Elizabeth Hill was conducted in 1999-2000 with additional drilling completed by East Coast Minerals NL until the project was sold to Global Strategic Metals NL in 2012. Alien Metals Ltd purchased the lease M47/342 in early 2020.\nGeology\n\u00b7\nDeposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nThe Elizabeth Hill silver mineralisation is structurally controlled and is located at the contact of the ultramafic Munni Munni intrusion to the east and Archaean gneisses and granites to the west. This contact is occupied by the north-south trending Munni Munni Fault. Mineralisation has been intersected over a 100m north-south zone along the boundary of the Munni Munni Fault, plunging south along the granite contact. The zone has an east-west width of 15-20m with the high-grade core restricted to around 3m width in the region of the underground workings. The mineralised zone is separated into several pods and occurs within a quartz carbonate chalcedonic silica breccia that contains carbonate and quartz veins. The silver occurs in fine disseminations, needles, veins, nuggets and platelets up to several centimetres in diameter.\nDrill hole Information\n\u00b7\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\u00a0o easting and northing of the drill hole collar\u00a0o elevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\u00a0o dip and azimuth of the hole\u00a0o down hole length and interception depth o hole length.\n\u00b7\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case\n\u00b7\nDrill information relevant to this release has been provided above in Appendix 1.\nData aggregation methods\n\u00b7\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g., cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\n\u00b7\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\n\u00b7\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated\n\u00b7\n2025 or historical drilling assay data referenced has previously been reported in ASX Announcements.\n\u00b7\npXRF results have only been used to confirm the presence of silver bearing minerals in support of geological logging.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\n\u00b7\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u00b7\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\n\u00b7\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g., 'down hole length, true width not known').\n\u00b7\nDrill hole intersections are not true widths due to sub vertical geometry of the mineralised body and the average -60\u00b0 dip of the drill holes in the 2025 drill program.\nDiagrams\n\u00b7\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported. These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\n\u00b7\nAppropriate maps and figures have been included in this announcement.\nBalanced reporting\n\u00b7\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results\n\u00b7\nAll relevant and material exploration data to highlight the target areas discussed have been reported or referenced.\n\u00b7\nNo assay data are reported.\n\u00b7\nHistorical drill data referenced in this release has been previously reported in ASX Announcements.\nOther substantive exploration data\n\u00b7\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances\n\u00b7\nAll relevant and material exploration data for the target areas discussed, have been reported or referenced.\nFurther work\n\u00b7\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (e.g., tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\n\u00b7\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFurther work will include but not limited to systematic geological mapping, channel and rock chip sampling, soil sampling, pXRF, geophysics, structural interpretation, historical data compilation, and drilling to identify suitable host rock geology and structural architecture for polymetallic mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nDiagrams are included in this Announcement.\n[1]\nPortable XRF readings are not a replacement for comprehensive laboratory analysis and only reflect elemental concentration at specific points, rather than the entire rock. While they assist in geological interpretation, verifying metal presence and selecting which samples should undergo full laboratory analysis, they offer only an approximate concentration.\n[2]\nWAMEX Annual Report,1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, Elizabeth Hill Silver Project, Global Strategic Metals NL, p16\n[3]\nwww.kitco.com/charts/silver\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Project, in which Alien retains a 30% free-carried interest through to a decision to mine, is operated by WCE.\nHighlights:\n\u2022\nExploration targeting to date has identified 12 high-priority ranked near mine targets based on integrated geophysics, geochemistry, and geological data.\n\u2022\nSome of the near mine targets include historical high-grade silver intersections from historical drill holes including:\n\u2022 2m at 1,550g/t Ag from 108m downhole depth in AMEHRC012.\n\u2022 1m at 250g/t Ag from 118m downhole depth in AG43.\n\u2022\nA comprehensive and ongoing exploration targeting project integrating legacy and recently collected data sets, including geochemistry, reprocessed geophysics and geological data has highlighted significant exploration targets.\n\u2022\nReinterpretation of structural controls using reprocessed magnetic data has defined the key role of the Munni Munni fault and granite/ultramafic contact in hosting silver mineralisation.\n\u2022\nAn additional 8 near mine and regional targets were identified, which are less advanced and pending geochemical results to be returned from the analytical laboratory.\n\u2022\nNext steps include detailed geological mapping, drilling of priority anomalies, trenching of ultramafic/granite contact and expansion of geochemical, geophysical and mapping coverage.\nThe Company is pleased to announce that following the assessment of the prospectivity within the historical mine environment (\nAIM: 16 July 2025\n), WCE has completed an integrated near mine and regional targeting study at the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project, located near Karratha in Western Australia.\nThe study, led by independent consultants ERM (formally CSA Global), has significantly enhanced the understanding of structural controls and silver mineralisation potential across the project area, identifying numerous high-priority near mine exploration targets for immediate testing.\nRobert Mosig, Technical Director, commented:\n\"The latest detailed targeting efforts by our JV partner, WCE, have greatly enhanced our confidence in the broader potential of the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project.\n\"Following WCE's recent highly successful capital raise, the project is well positioned to rapidly commence testing these high-priority targets - especially those near the historic mine. By integrating multiple datasets, we have established a clear plan to explore for additional silver occurrences.\"\nIntegrated Targeting Study\nThe integrated targeting study has delivered significant advancement in West Coast Silver's geological understanding of the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project.\nData sets investigated in this study include:\n\u2022\nHistorical near mine and regional drill hole data;\n\u2022\nHistorical soil, multi-element geochemical data;\n\u2022\nWCE rock chip and float sample multi-element geochemical data;\n\u2022\nReview of historical trench geochemical data; and\n\u2022\nHistorical magnetic, radiometric and gravity data.\nThe analysis of the integrated data sets confirms the primary control on high-grade silver mineralisation at Elizabeth Hill is the intersection of the Munni Munni fault with the granite-ultramafic rock contact, a structurally favourable setting known to host significant mineralisation at the historical Elizabeth Hill underground mine.\nThe re-evaluation of a large volume of historical and recent data sets led to the identification and ranking of 12 high priority targets on near-mine tenements. These targets were assessed based on the following criteria:\n1. Proximity to key structural features such as north-trending faults and fault flexures.\n2. Proximity to granite/ultramafic rock contacts.\n3. Coherent silver-in-soil anomalies with multi-element support (including copper and zinc).\n4. Presence of gossanous material or historical float samples with elevated silver.\n5. Underexplored zones due to ineffective past drilling or transported cover in regolith.\nThe 12 near-mine targets remain untested or ineffectively tested, particularly those to the south of the historic mine where the main silver shoot is interpreted to step down along east-trending faults. This step-down geometry provides a compelling exploration insight into the search for extensions of the high-grade silver mineralised zone.\nFigure\n1\n- Near Mine (NM) Targets generated from data study (RTP Band Pass Filter Tilt Magnetic Image)\nHigh-Priority Exploration Targets - Near Mine\nThe target generation study has defined two near mine targets (NM5 and NM1) for immediate follow up exploration (refer\nFigure 1\n,\nFigure 2\n,\nTable 1\n).\nNear mine target NM5 is located along the interpreted Munni Munni fault at the granite/ultramafic rock contact to the south of the Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine. It is supported by two very high-grade silver intersections in historical drill holes AG43 (1m @ 250g/t Ag from 118m downhole depth) and AMEHRC012 (2m @ 1,550g/t Ag from 108m downhole depth).\nNear mine target NM1 is located about 100m north of the historical Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine along the interpreted Munni Munni fault. This target is supported by one silver intersection in historical drill hole 22AMC011 (4m @ 60g/t Ag from 4m downhole depth) within a granite host rock and surrounded on the surface by three high-grade float samples and one high-grade rock chip sample (refer to WCE ASX Release dated 21 July 2025).\nSeveral other high-priority targets are located at the eastern contact of the Munni Munni ultramafic/mafic intrusion and eastern granite (RS9, RS11 to RS15; Figure 1, Figure 2).\nThese targets are supported by silver in soil anomalies and are located along an interpreted fault paralleling the eastern margin of the ultramafic/mafic Munni Munni intrusion in a similar structural position and host rock setting to the Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine.\nNear mine target NM3 is located about 200m west of the historical Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine and is supported by one silver intersection in drill hole EC052 (2m @ 74g/t Ag from 48m downhole depth) in granite host rock.\nOther near mine targets include NM2, located at a possible historical gossan occurrence, and NM6, located at an interpreted structural dilatational jog in the Munni Munni fault.\nNear mine target NM4 is supported by observations within the historical Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine, where silver mineralisation was identified at the lower contact of the ultramafic/mafic rock to the granite.\nRank\nTarget\nType of Target\nDescription\n1\nNM5\nDrill\nAg intersections in drill holes AMEHRC012 (2m @ 1,550g/t Ag) and AG43 (1m @250g/t Ag) at the ultramafic/granite contact, and interpreted location of the Munni Munni fault\n2\nNM1\nDrill\nAg in drill hole 22AMC011 (4m @ 60g/t Ag)\n3\nNM3\nDrill\nAg intersection in drill hole EC052 (2m @ 74g/t Ag) within granite\n4\nRS15\nSoil\nAnomalous Ag in three 100m spaced soil lines\n5\nRS11\nSoil\nLong coherent Ag soil anomaly defined over five sample lines\n6\nRS12\nSoil\nSingle soil line with anomalous Ag\n7\nRS13\nSoil\nSingle soil line with anomalous Ag\n8\nRS14\nSoil\nSingle soil line with anomalous Ag\n9\nRS9\nSoil\nThree-line Ag soil anomaly\n10\nNM6\nGeological/Structural\nPotential embayment in the ultramafic/granite contacts and structural dilatational jog in the Munni Munni fault\n11\nNM4\nGeological\nUltramafic footwall contact to granite is interpreted in NM4 and where drill tested in the historical mine sequence it is mineralised\n12\nNM2\nGossan\nHistorical gossan outcrop, Ag in float samples\nTable 1\n- Ranked Priority Targets and Targeting Criteria\nThe study also revealed coherent regional anomalies to the north and south of the mine along structures that are subparallel to the Munni Munni fault, highlighting broader structural repetitions or analogue targets within the belt.\nExploration targeting is ongoing as newly completed geochemistry data is received and integrated with historical information.\nOther Priority Exploration Targets\nAn additional eight exploration targets were identified in the near mine and regional scale with less mature data sets that currently do not meet the criteria for advanced exploration projects (refer Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1).

This fieldwork may include a combination of trenching, air core/RC drilling and geophysics. This work would be undertaken in parallel with exploration follow up of the previously announced shallow mineralisation in the Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine area (\nAIM: 16 July 2025\n).\nCautionary Statement\nThe potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource.\nFor historical drill data and JORC table, refer ASX: WCE announcement dated 05 August 2025.\nThe Elizabeth Hill Project\nElizabeth Hill is one of Australia's high-grade silver projects and has a proven production history outlined below:\n\u2022\nHigh grades enabled low processing tonnes\n: 1.2Moz of silver was produced from just 16,830t of ore at a head grade of 2,194g/t (70.5 oz/t Ag).\n\u2022\nPrevious mining operation ceased in 2000\n: because of low silver prices (US$5).\n\u2022\nSimplistic historical processing technique:\nnative silver was recovered via low-cost gravity separation techniques.\n\u2022\nUntapped potential remains\nin ground with the deposit open at depth and recent consolidation of the land package offers potential to discover more Elizabeth Hill style deposits.\n\u2022\nTier 1 Mining Jurisdiction located on a mining lease\nwith potential processing option at the nearby Radio Hill mine site.\nFigure 3\n- Tenement location\nThrough the consolidation of the surrounding land packages into a single contiguous 180km2 package, significant exploration and growth potential exists both near mine and regionally. The land package holds a significant portion of the Munni Munni fault system, and other fault systems subparallel to the Munni Munni fault system, which are considered prospective for Elizabeth Hill lookalike silver deposits.\nCompetent Person's Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to Exploration Targets is based on information compiled by Mr Robert Mosig a Competent Person who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr Mosig is a Director of West Coast Silver Limited and a Director of Alien Metals Limited.\nMr Mosig has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposits under consideration and to the activity being undertaken to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves', and a Specialist under the 2015 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Public Reporting of technical assessments and valuations of mineral assets'.\nMr Mosig consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on his information and in the form and context in which it appears.\nFor further information,\nplease\nvisit the\nCompany's website\nat\nwww.alienmetals.uk\nor\ncontact:\nStrand Hanson\n(Financial\nand\nNominated\nAdviser)\nJames Harris / James Dance / Robert Collins Tel: +44 (0) 207 409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited (Joint\nBroker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell Tel +44 (0) 203 829 5000\nTurner Pope (Joint Broker)\nAndy Thacker / James Pope\nTel: +44 (0) 203 657 0050\nCMC Markets (Joint\nBroker)\nDouglas\nCrippen\nTel: +44 (0) 203 003\n8632\nYellow\nJersey\n(Financial\nPR)\nCharles Goodwin / Shivantha Thambirajah\nTel: +44 (0) 203 004 9512\nNotes to\nEditors\nAlien Metals Ltd is a mining exploration and development company listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (AIM: UFO).
