Total LFL revenue turned positive in the quarter, having increased by +1.5%, continuing the improving trend from previous quarters (Q1: -8.3%, Q2: -2.1%, Q3: -0.6%)4.\nEcommerce LFL revenue was -2.5% in Q4, improving from -5.1% last quarter as further customer experience improvements were delivered.\nRetail revenue growth of +8.9% in Q4 benefited from continued momentum in LFL revenue growth (+4.3%), the opening of two new stores in the previous quarter and the upsize relocation of a third store during the fourth quarter, partly offset by the closure of three smaller garden centre stores and the Cookery School part way through the quarter.\nFull year revenue of \u00a362.6m increased by +0.4% YoY, or +1.6% excluding the Amazon EU channels which were exited last year.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, the Group held a net debt position of \u00a30.7m (FY23 Q4: \u00a32.8m) with available liquidity of \u00a315.3m.\nOutlook\nSales performance during the fourth quarter has been in line with the Board's expectations and with strong margin and cost discipline, the Board expects full year Underlying PBT for FY24 to be between \u00a30.5m to \u00a31.0m, marginally ahead of market expectations5.\nThe Group has made good strategic progress during the year, including opening new stores, the launch in March of our new small kitchen electricals range, improvements in customer experience online and in store, and delivering even greater value for customers through meaningful price reductions across much of our range.\nWhilst the macro environment remains difficult for consumers, we are confident that the work done to strengthen our business over the last two years will support a stronger performance in the new financial year and as conditions improve, enabling the Group to deliver profitable and sustainable growth for all stakeholders.\nWe remain confident that our specialist retail proposition, with a high-quality and carefully curated product range which is 100% direct-sourced and own-brand, paired with our excellent customer service both in store and online, stands us apart from our competitors.\nLee Tappenden, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"I am pleased with the growing momentum in our performance which reflects the enhanced range, experience and value we are delivering to our customers.\n\"Despite the market remaining subdued, we are gaining share giving us confidence that our proposition continues to resonate with consumers. We look forward to delivering further strategic progress as we continue to build an even stronger customer-focused business which will allow us to accelerate profitable growth as trading conditions improve.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nProCook Group plc\nLee Tappenden, Chief Executive Officer\nDan Walden, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@procook.co.uk\nMHP Group (Financial PR Adviser)\nKatie Hunt\nCatherine Chapman\nprocook@mhpgroup.com\nTel: +44 (0)7711 191 518\nNext scheduled event:\nProCook expects to release its FY24 preliminary results on 26 June 2024.\nNotes to editors:\nProCook is the UK's leading direct-to-consumer specialist kitchenware brand.
