The Company now has reduced revenue and earnings expectations which can be attributed to lower sales at Martek Power, and to the customer led delayed delivery of an aerospace contract. These events have resulted in changes to management expectations as follows.\nFor the current financial year ending 30 September 2025, full year Group revenues are expected to reduce by c.\u00a33.0m to c.\u00a321.5m. This would result in full year adjusted PBT reducing to a loss of c.\u00a31.3m.\n2025 Reported PBT of c.\u00a30.5m loss remains in line with previous expectations due to various exceptional income: negative goodwill on the Martek acquisition and, profit on sale of property details of which are provided below.\nFor the financial year ending 30 September 2026, revenues are expected to reduce slightly by c.\u00a31.5m to c.\u00a327m. However, because of our accelerated organisational restructuring, earnings expectations for adjusted PBT of \u00a30.6m are maintained.\nAs previously communicated, we have had an extremely strong order intake this financial year to date, of c.\u00a327m, which gives us a solid foundation for our future growth plans.\nProperty Disposal\nThe Company is pleased to announce the sale of freehold premises in Thatcham, Berkshire, having exchanged on 25 September 2025 and completion expected during 26 September 2025. The consideration payable at completion is \u00a3355,000 and the cash proceeds will be used to reduce net debt. Net book value was c.\u00a386,000 as at 31 March 2025. Previous LPA operations at these premises have been relocated to other existing LPA sites, with the addition of a smaller leased office in the area. The profit on disposal net of sale costs is expected to be recognised as exceptional income in the current year's results, as referred to above.\nRobert B Horvath, Chairman of LPA Group, commented:\n\"Our strong order intake of \u00a327m for this financial year underpins our ability to deliver on our future growth plans and further endorses our strategic decision to accelerate the restructuring of the organisation into 'One LPA'. The restructuring of LPA is near to completion, and I am confident that we are already seeing the business benefits.\nIt is widely acknowledged that UK manufacturing output has contracted over the last three months and is attributed to global issues including US import tariffs and domestic uncertainty around economic and government policies. It is fair to assume we are not immune from this as we are an integral part of the supply chains of large manufacturing organisations. However, we have seen a more positive output in September.\"\nEnquires:\nLPA Group plc\n+44 (0) 1799 512 800\nRobert B Horvath,\nChairman\nPhilo Daniel-Tran\n,\nChief Executive Officer\nStuart Stanyard,\nChief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd (Nominated Advisor and Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCorporate Finance\nEd Frisby / Issac Hooper / Elysia Bough\nCorporate Broking\nTim Redfern\nAbout LPA\nLPA Group plc (AIM: LPA) is an\ninnovation-led engineering specialist in electronic and electro-mechanical components and systems\n.\nFocused on transport (rail and aviation), aerospace, defence, infrastructure and industrial markets and supplying into hostile and challenging environments, LPA is known for engineering solutions to improve product reliability, reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.\nThe Group has four sites across the UK, selling to customers in the UK and overseas.

In the last six months we have continued to see strength in the order book and additional opportunities arising particularly through our two most recent acquisitions. Importantly, I stated that we will supplement our journey with new opportunities to acquire product lines or businesses, but always with resilient intellectual property rights embedded into them. This will enable us to leverage our technical engineering skills to best effect and diversify across complementary sectors such as industrial and aviation. The acquisition of the former Martek power supply business in March 2025 is a good example of our strategy coming together.\nThe first half of this year has been extremely challenging for the business, which as previously flagged has been largely impacted by the UK passenger rail market and the indecision that we are seeing in the industry around the re-nationalisation and formation of Great British Railways (\"GBR\"). The safe and reliable operation of rolling stock rests with the operating companies. On 25 May 2025 the Southwest rail operating franchise was terminated and handed back to the control of GBR soon to be followed by C2C and then Anglia. These are the start of a series of quarterly 'hand backs' that will see all 14 franchises being run by GBR. Each franchise has operated with rolling stock provided under operating leases from the Rolling Stock Companies (\"ROSCOs\"); often designed to be coterminous with the franchise period. These leases will now need commercial audit. While our sales have been slowed we have nevertheless won good orders and the Group is pleased to report that there are further good opportunities and prospects that will arise in the rail industry in the foreseeable future as these new operating lease arrangements and the responsibility for the life and maintenance regimes of the fleets falls to GBR as the Entity in Charge of Maintenance.\nEnquiry levels for Aerospace and Aviation products have generally been strong for us over the last six months, albeit our Red Box sales programme into our distribution network has been affected by slower certification and release of newly developed products. Red Box has not met its budget sales aspirations in the six months, but this is not due to lack of demand. We are however pleased to have completed the integration of Red Box International and see long term opportunities within general aviation.\nIn March 2024 we announced that we had pushed back our budget assumptions for sales of inter-car jumper connectors to certain UK and EU end customers. Originally planned to be supplied in five phases, the programme has now been modified and spread out over an 8-year period with a small ramp up starting in September 2025. Whilst this clearly spreads the revenue income for the Saffron Walden facility over a substantially longer period, we expect this will bear fruit under the new re-nationalised programme.\nWe started a process a year ago of looking at the size of our overheads, the number of manufacturing locations, what we could outsource overseas and how we can create engineering excellence in design and innovation. Software skills are such an important aspect of modern-day electrical engineering, and we will continue to focus on this as one of our core strengths. We believe that we have competitive advantage for many of our products in our local manufacturing facilities and can deliver quality product both in the UK and overseas.\nI was delighted to welcome Dr Philo Daniel-Tran, our new Chief Executive Officer to the Board in January this year and to hand over the responsibility for delivering the Board's vision for the business to her. As the new CEO Philo Daniel, will shape the strategy with her own ideas and bring in skills to support her. This first half year has been a busy period of transformation with a particular emphasis on sales and marketing, engineering capability and operational excellence.\nAs an exporter, macroeconomic factors are dominated by world events not just the UK government and policy. This ranges from transport to tariffs to interest rates and currency exchange, but most of all consumer confidence and the decision making of our customers wishing to invest in the underlying transport infrastructure. We have put in place hedging strategies to safeguard our profitability vis a vis Euro-denominated order book activity most notably in our Normanton business. We continue to focus on sales, quality and delivery and have made substantial changes to our management teams and the way we run the business to support the delivery of our strategic goals. Our people are integral to our success, and we will continue to invest in them and their ability to deliver the strategy.\nRobert B Horvath\nChairman\n19 June 2025\nCEO Review\nI took up the leadership of this business in January recognising that the business required change, both structural and pace. Since taking up the helm I have engaged with the existing leadership team to understand the business and the root causes of our challenges.\nAt the end of my first month in post, I announced a reorganisation to eliminate the divisional structure and create a unified Company with a \"One-LPA\" vision. I am confident that this approach will enable functional teams to share knowledge and resources across all sites, deliver cost efficiencies and become more customer-centric. Together we have redefined our Vision, Mission, and Values, and launched strategic action plans focused on empowering our teams to deliver effectively, enabling us to achieve growth in both new and existing market segments and portfolios.\nThe One-LPA structure has provided me with the opportunity to reshape and energise our new executive team and we expect that all changes will be in place by the end of FY25. Together, we will deliver the transformation needed to change the status quo. While the reorganisation will take time to settle, I am confident that establishing a strong foundation is essential for building future growth.\nI recognise that we currently have too many manufacturing sites in the Group. To address this, I have initiated the process of moving the production from Thatcham to the Saffron Walden site by the end of FY25. This transition will help streamline and consolidate our operations, to become a more operationally effective business. We also have several strategic optimisation projects in place to generate cost savings and maximise the Group's capabilities.\nWe have begun streamlining our existing portfolio of products to align with our short-term goals, which includes margin enhancement. To achieve our long-term vision, we will develop a pipeline of customer-centric innovations in new product development across Aviation, Aerospace and Defence, Rail and other related markets.\nRail\n- The Board recognised that the first half trading would be challenging. However, I am encouraged by the strong order intake across our rail portfolio, in particular growth in our DACH market. Despite recent schedule changes for the UK market, I am confident that the work will materialise in due course.\nAviation, Aerospace and Defence\n- Our Red Box acquisition is becoming more embedded and new product development will drive our future growth and diversification; however, our performance has been slightly impacted by protracted certification on new products in the first half. Our next generation Quad Plane Power cable carrier has immense potential and prototypes are currently being tested at major customers. Additionally, our product solutions are being embedded by our customers in a number of high-profile exciting aircraft designs.\nIndustrial and other\n- We are reassessing our ability to develop the next generation of current products, whilst talking to prospective customers to leverage our capabilities into new applications.\nLPA is a global leader in the design and manufacture of engineered product solutions, and I am excited to build and guide my team through this crucial phase. As we embed our refined strategy and vision, I am confident in LPA's capabilities and professional heritage, which will help us remain competitive in our existing market segments and expand into new markets.\nSince joining the Company earlier this year, I have been pleased to see that we have a strong business with a number of attractive growth opportunities. The measures that have been implemented so far will create a stronger foundation for future growth, underpinned by a more streamlined and operationally excellent business. Whilst the first half has had its challenges, I am confident in our prospects for the future.\nPhilo Daniel-Tran\n19 June 2025\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n6 months to\n6 months to\nYear to\n31 Mar 25\n31 Mar 24\n30 Sept 24\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRevenue\n5\n9,523\n11,557\n23,546\nCost of Sales\n(7,881)\n(9,249)\n(18,068)\nGross Profit\n1,642\n2,308\n5,478\nDistribution Costs\n(1,067)\n(1,109)\n(2,424)\nAdministrative Expenses -

They do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2024.\nThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nthe requirements of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards\n.\nThese financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value.\nThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the last annual financial statements for the year to 30 September 2024. The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements and are expected to be followed throughout the year ending 30 September 2025.\nNote 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of judgements and estimates\nIn preparing these interim financial statements management is required to make judgements on the application of the Group's accounting policies and make estimates about the future. Actual results may differ from these assumptions. The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2024.\nNew standards and interpretation adopted by the Group\nThere has been no impact of new standards and interpretations adopted in the period.\nNOTE 3 ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS\nAs announced on 17 March 2025, LPA acquired UK trade and assets of a power supply provider from Eaton Electrical Products Limited. The book value of assets acquired was \u00a3716,000. A fair value exercise has been carried out and negative goodwill of \u00a3640,000 has been recognised. The consideration of \u00a376,000 was paid in full on acquisition.\nNOTE\n4 GOING CONCERN\nThe Group's business activities and the factors likely to affect its future performance together with the Group's treasury policy, its approach to the management of financial risk, and its exposure to liquidity and credit risks are outlined fully in the Annual Report & Accounts 2024 which details trading, new financing and to a lesser extent supply chain shortages and inflationary pressures.\nIn assessing going concern the Directors note that the Group: (i) is expected to return to profitability through the second half of its 2025 financial year and continue to trade profitably in the near term; (ii) has in place adequate working capital facilities for its forecast needs; (iii) has a strong current order book with significant further opportunities in its market place; and (iv) has proven adaptable in past periods of adversity over many years. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.\nThe directors continue to develop its strong working relationship with its bank that provides for the funding and working capital facilities. Should there be additional delays in our project-based work then there are actions available to management to mitigate any cash need. We expect if required the bank would remain supportive and a suitable agreement would be reached to provide the Group with sufficient financing.\nHaving assessed all aspects of the business and the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that the Directors would consider undertaking or have undertaken, the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing these interim financial statements.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Directors, after making enquiries, inclusive but not limited to updated forecasts and expectations, liabilities and risks and ongoing support from the Group's bank, have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nNOTE 5 Operating Segments\nAll the Group's operations and activities are based in, and its assets located in, the United Kingdom. For management purposes the Group comprises three product groups (in accordance with IFRS 8) - LPA Connection Systems (electro-mechanical), LPA Lighting Systems (lighting & electronics) systems and LPA Channel Electric (engineered component distribution), which collectively design, manufacture and market industrial electrical and electronic products. They operate across three market segments - Rail; Aerospace & Defence and Other. It is on this basis that the Board of Directors assess Group performance.

The exceptional item in the year to 30 September 2024 related to the non-recurring acquisition costs of Red Box International and group reorganisation / staff changes costs.\nNOTE 7 Loss PER SHARE\nThe calculations of loss per share are based upon the loss after tax attributable to ordinary equity shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, less investment in own shares.\nDetails are as follows:\n6 months to\n6 months to\nYear to\n31 Mar 25\n31 Mar 24\n30 Sept 23\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nLoss for the period - \u00a3000\n(197)\n(300)\n(325)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period (million)\n13,203\n13,192\n13,203\nDilutive effect of share options (million)\n-\n-\n-\nNumber of shares for diluted earnings per share (million)\n13,203\n13,192\n13,203\nBasic loss per share\n(1.49)p\n(2.27)p\n(2.46)p\nDiluted loss per share\n(1.49)p\n(2.27)p\n(2.46)p\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares and share options in issue during the period. For the period ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2025, the basic and diluted loss per share are equal since where a loss is incurred the effect of outstanding share options and warrants is considered anti-dilutive and is ignored for the purpose of the loss per share calculation.\nNOTE 8 INFORMATION\nLPA Group Plc is the Group's ultimate parent company.
