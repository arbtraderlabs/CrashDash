At Ruby Soho, we have seen over 250 meters of strike length and continuous lithium mineralization. Having looked in detail at Midnight Owl, we believe a sub-horizontal lithium-rich pegmatite went largely untested by prior drilling. We now have the ability to quicky drill-test the concept with reverse circulation drill holes for quicker and cheaper results. This, and follow-up to the 8.40m of 1.17% Li2O in channel samples, indicate there are clear targets we can easily access and drill-test in the next phase of drilling.\nAt Basin West, we are entering a new phase of exploration with the pursuit of the Environmental Assessment (EA) and examining further exploration potential at the Basin Project. Obtaining the EAs will allow us the opportunity to build on the expansion of the resource to 2.81MT of LCE identified last year, on which ourselves and the BLM remain highly encouraged.\nThis is a fantastic development that edges us towards our objective of a potential production decision. We look forward to providing updates on progress in due course.\"\nSan Domingo NOI's\nTwo key bonding permits were approved by the BLM for two NOI's at San Domingo, notably Dragon and San Domingo North, where the Company has defined high priority drill targets at Dragon, Ruby Soho and Midnight Owl. As described in PR 03 September, 2024, the undrilled Dragon targets demonstrate excellent channel sample geochemistry highlighted by 8.80m at 0.97% Li2O plus 174ppm cesium and 10.40m at 0.68% Li2O and 341ppm cesium. Dragon also contains the highest Li2O sample to date at 7.99%, highlighting the high-grade nature of lithium mineralization across the Dragon targets. The newly discovered Ruby Soho target, containing rock chip samples up to 3.57% Li2O along a 250m strike length and eight samples ranging from 0.255% to 3.57% Li2O (see PR 01 October, 2024). Proposed drill sites at both targets are designed to drill proximal and perpendicular to the strike of spodumene-bearing pegmatites.\nThe San Domingo North NOI includes several closely spaced holes at Midnight Owl where a sub-horizontal pegmatite target has gone mostly untested by prior drilling campaigns and was recognized during recent mapping and 3-D geologic modeling. The target can be tested with shallow holes of 30m to 50m each. Additional targets at Midnight Owl will test the upper-plate (above a low-angle fault) of an untested spodumene bearing pegmatite, again with shallow drill holes. The lower plate (below a low-angle fault with 20m offset) contains the high-grade spodumene mineralization found in drill hole SD22-024 where 31.85m at 1.60% Li2O was encountered (see PR 06 February, 2023). The upper plate contains outcropping and spodumene bearing pegmatite with channel sample results identified 8.40m of 1.17% Li2O with 625ppm cesium and is an undrilled portion of the pegmatite where prior core holes did not test this portion of the pegmatite. Detailed surface mapping combined with excellent lithium-rich channel samples and 3-D geologic modeling present a viable and shallow target to potentially grow the high-grade Midnight Owl drill hole intercepts from the 2023 drilling program.\nSan Domingo Land Acquisition\nThe Company has recently acquired an additional 160 acres of newly \"freed-up\" Arizona State Lands in the northeastern edge of the lode claims at San Domingo. The new land contains a portion of the Ruby Soho trend, thus, is strategic and beneficial for future drilling along strike towards the north. Within the new State mineral lease, a large outcrop of lithium bearing pegmatite was found separate from Ruby Soho, on the edge of Tertiary volcanic cover and contains rock chip samples running 1.47%, 0.80%, and 0.26% Li2O. A total of ten samples have been collected in this new mineral lease, with values ranging from 0.01% to 1.47% Li2O, all rock chip samples collected from pegmatites.\nBasin West EPO\nThe amended Basin West EPO was accepted by the Kingman BLM District office and now moves into the NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) process for development of an EA (Environmental Assessment). Following our 2024 Basin resource expansion drilling, which reached 2.81MT of LCE (See PR 01 July, 2024), undrilled targets to the west provide unbridled potential where lithium anomalous clays are identified over much of the 11.8km2 EPO area. The Company will be working closely with the BLM to address all NEPA environmental and cultural related concerns and writing of the EA. Once approved, the EA will open our ability to continue drill-testing high quality lithium in clay targets and continue expansion of the existing resource.\nQualified Person (Bradda Head)\nJoey Wilkins,\u00a0B.Sc.,\u00a0P.Geo., is\u00a0Chief Operating Officer\u00a0at Bradda Head and the Qualified Person who reviewed and approved the technical disclosures in this news release.\u00a0Mr Wilkins\u00a0is a graduate of the\u00a0University of Arizona\u00a0with a\u00a0B.Sc. in Geology with more than 39 years of experience in mineral exploration and is a qualified person under the AIM Rules and a Qualified Person as defined under NI-43-101.\u00a0Mr Wilkins\u00a0consents to the inclusion of the technical information in this release and context in which it appears.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU No. 596/2014) AS IT FORMS PART OF\u00a0UK\u00a0DOMESTIC LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE\u00a0EUROPEAN UNION\u00a0(WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018.

The results included\n5.00m of 2.33%, 4.10m of 2.81%, and 4.00m of 1.26% Li2O\nat the White Ridge Target and\n5.30m of 1.25% Li2O\nat Morning Star. These and other surface samples collected were designed to augment the Phase II, 2023 drilling program as well as determine that this technique can and will be applied to future surface exploration programs planned in Q3 of this year.\nSample locations include: Morning Star, South Morning Star, White Ridge, and Midnight Owl.\nChannel Sample Highlights\n:\n\u00b7\n5.00m @ 2.33% Li20 at White Ridge\n\u00b7\n4.10m @ 2.81% Li2O at White Ridge\n\u00b7\n4.00m @ 1.26% Li2O at White Ridge\n\u00b7\n5.30m @ 1.25% Li2O at Morning Star\n\u00b7\n4.00m @ 0.43 % Li2O at South Morning Star\n\u00b7\n2.90m @ 2.31% Li2O at Midnight Owl\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nA total of 77 samples were collected from strategic targets across the San Domingo project, with locations designed to supplement drill holes that contain lithium (spodumene) mineralization, particularly those\nthat could result in mineable resources;\n\u00b7\nSome locations were chosen as a result of\nnewly exposed spodumene\nbearing pegmatites at new drill sites;\n\u00b7\nWhite Ridge\nchannel samples correspond to drill hole SD-DH23-072, confirming continuity of spodumene rich pegmatite, indicates mineralization is open to the north and at depth;\n\u00b7\nChannel samples at\nMorning Star\ndrill site SD-DH23-090 cut, 5.30m at 1.25% Li2O, clearly connect and add confidence in continuity, building on resource potential;\n\u00b7\nThe channel samples at\nMidnight Owl\nlikely connect to drill hole SD-DH23-049 which had an intercept of 6.35m @ 0.83% Li2O and 3.05m of 1.03% (see 11 Nov 2023 Press Release for details), a distance of 55m from surface.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is capitalizing on surface lithium mineralization exposures through channel sample techniques and by connecting to drill holes; this continues to demonstrate open cut potential and in part, will drive the next exploration program\nIan Stalker, Executive Chair, commented:\n\"\nWe are highly encouraged by the surface channel samples taken at our San Domingo Project, which was designed to test multiple sample locations and provide further data that can be integrated into our planned work programme whilst targeting resource development. We believe that these high-grade samples bode extremely well for the potential of the asset in its entirety, and reaffirms favourable results from both previous sampling undertaken by Bradda, as well as the historic sampling.\nLooking forward, the success of this cost-effective and efficient technique is also a notable positive, particularly as we look to further our surface exploration in Q3 of this year. This demonstrates our innovative thinking in regard to how to best maximise our resources, and so far, we are having great success.\"\nChannel samples collected at\nWhite Ridge\nmine cut returned excellent results, including 5.00m at 2.33% and 4.10m at 2.81% Li2O. Each of the three sample groups at White Ridge are separated by roughly 2.0m, where sample material was unavailable. The results strengthen Bradda's confidence that the values represent viable thicknesses in these steeply dipping pegmatites. The sample locations are correlative to drill hole SD-DH23-072 intercept which carries 5.18m @ 0.88% Li2O (see January 16, 2024 RNS for drill hole intercepts), see Figure 1 below. The shallow mineralization in the mine cut and at depth in the drill hole is open to the north.\nFigure 1. White Ridge channel sample locations and values in percent, drill hole intercept and surface projection.\nThe sampling on the surface at\nMorning Star\nand near the center of this target, contains 5.30m a 1.25% Li2O, which is proximal to drill hole SD-DH23-090 where 2.80m of 0.655% Li2O was encountered within a broader zone of 17.43m at 0.18% Li2O (see Figure 2 below). Towards the north end of Morning Star and proximal to drill hole SD-DH23-093 is an isolated 0.80m sample running 5.337% Li2O. Hole SD-DH23-093 contains 8.99m at 1.20% Li2O, which could link to the 5.337% surface sample, providing opportunity for expansion in this part of Morning Star.\nMine cut channels collected at\nSouth Morning Star\n, resulted in 4.00m of 0.43% Li2O. This interval is very proximal and above drill hole SD-DH23-099 which contains 6.69m at 0.576% Li2O followed by 5.55mm at 1.034% Li2O.\nThe mine cut at\nMidnight Owl\nwas sampled, resulting in a 2.90m interval running 2.31% Li2O. This interval is the up-dip correlation to intervals seen in our drill holes, such as hole SD-DH23-049 which has 6.35m at 0.83% Li2O followed by 3.05m at 1.03% Li2O (see Figure 3). These drill hole intercepts are interpreted to connect with the surface channel samples, a vertical distance of 55m. Several areas within the historic mine were inaccessible due to steep walls or obvious spodumene which was out of reach. Outcrops above and outside the mine were also sampled to provide information on natural exposures.\nFigure 2. Morning Star channel samples and relevant drill hole intercepts.\nElevated to well mineralized lithium-rich channel samples also contained very anomalous amounts of tin, tantalum, caesium, niobium, and rubidium, again typifying the LCT nature of this pegmatite district.\nBradda Head considers this channel sample program a success and will continue to implement this technique over the property on pegmatites that are reasonably accessible, visibly lithium-bearing, offering the opportunity to collect clean samples over continuous lengths and subsequently adding value to future drill targeting.\nThe sampling procedures were designed for integration into 3-D models that could lead to development of shallow resources. Sample cuts were made with a diamond saw along contiguous exposures, adding certified standards for every 10th sample, similar to our drill holes. Cuts were dominantly horizontal and along pegmatite exposures with a diamond handheld core saw. Two parallel cuts were made at 4-5cm apart and the material between the cuts was sampled to depths of 2-3cm.\nFigure 3 above. Midnight Owl channel samples and nearby drill holes.\nFigure 4 above. Location map of channel samples, property, drilling, land\nBasin Drilling Update\nThe drilling at Basin is progressing well, with the Company completing its second drill hole, encountering\n>\n80 meters of Upper Clay in both holes and finding encouraging thicknesses of between 25 to 35m of the Lower Clay unit. The first two holes have been logged, sampled, and shipped to the laboratory for analysis.\nQAQC\nChannel samples cut in the field under the supervision of Joey Wilkins. Samples cuts were labelled and photographed, bags were tied-off, labelled, then transported to the core shed under lock and key. Samples were shipped by the Company directly to SGS Laboratories in Burnaby, B.C., Canada where SGS prepped then analysed all samples using sodium peroxide fusion combined ICP-AES and ICP-MS, method GE_ICM90A50. Certified standards were inserted into the sample stream and reviewed by the Qualified Person.

Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.\nIndicated Mineral Resource\nThat part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.\nSn\nTin\nTa2O5\nTantalum pentoxide\nForward-Looking Statements\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
