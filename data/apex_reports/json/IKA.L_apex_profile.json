Ilika can now confirm its equipment has been commissioned and successfully passed its User Acceptance Tests (UATs). These production tools include layer deposition machines as well as alignment and patterning machines. This final stage in the commissioning of Stereax new manufacturing facilities means that both Cirtec and Ilika are now satisfied that the equipment meets its requirement for the start of production transfer.\nTo support equipment commissioning, since June 2024, Ilika has delivered a series of batches of cathode-coated wafers to Cirtec, for further processing and verification of subsequent process steps. Process qualification has the aim of refining and tuning the process equipment to achieve specified product performance in preparation for the start of product manufacturing. Ilika currently retains and will operate part of the production equipment in the UK, including that for cathode deposition and cell formation and testing.\nIn August 2023, Ilika and Cirtec Medical announced that they had concluded contractual negotiations by signing a ten-year manufacturing licence to produce the Stereax range of mm-scale batteries at Cirtec's facility in Lowell. This partnership will reinforce Cirtec's ongoing activities in system level miniaturisation for the medical device industry, whilst Ilika will focus on advanced technology development and IP licensing in support of Cirtec's manufacturing and commercialisation activities.\nGraeme Purdy, Ilika Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\"\nWe are delighted to announce that Stereax is now one step closer towards starting production and enabling its deployment into miniature active medical devices. We thank Cirtec and Ilika colleagues for their effort into completing the transfer of Stereax production equipment to the Lowell facilities.\"\nBrian Highley, Cirtec Medical Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\"This marks a pivotal achievement in the collaboration between Ilika, a leader in advanced miniaturised solid state battery technology, and Cirtec, renowned developing and manufacturing implantable medical devices and complex catheters and delivery systems.

We look forward to further collaboration on our commercialisation journey and welcome the UK government's recent announcement of \u00a32B of funding which will catalyse faster progress in this space.\"\nSean Gilgunn, Managing Director of UKBIC, said:\n\"This success highlights the valuable contribution UKBIC can make to scaling up innovation in the UK's growing battery sector. Ilika's technology is a great example of the kind of cutting edge thinking which can drive the UK economy when properly supported.\"\nIlika announced in October 2023 receipt of grant support from the Automotive Transformation Fund ('ATF') in an 18-month,\u00a0\u00a32.7 million\u00a0collaboration programme to scale up Ilika's Goliath solid-state battery production capability. Via the programme, Ilika partnered with Mpac Group plc ('Mpac') (AIM: MPAC) global supplier of packaging and assembly automation, UKBIC and Agratas, Tata Group's global battery business.\nIn this collaboration, codenamed Project SiSTEM, UKBIC and Ilika have carried out physical trials to demonstrate preparation and roll-to-roll coating of its proprietary solid state materials. The ongoing trials are providing evidence that Ilika's approach to large format solid-state battery manufacture can be carried out with the types of mixing and coating equipment widely used in existing gigafactories.\nThe programme activities with Mpac and Agratas are also making strong progress and remain on track. Ilika is working closely with Mpac on completing the fabrication and testing of a\n1.5MWh solid-state battery assembly line capable of delivering Ilika's Goliath prototype large-format pouch cells to automotive original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers. As stated in October 2023, the solid-state battery assembly line is expected to be fully operational at Ilika's facility by the end of H1 202\n5. In parallel, the activities with Agratas have produced a detailed gap analysis between Agratas's leading edge lithium-ion battery process and Ilika's process with the key result that the solid-state battery application would cause minimum disruption.\nENDS\n--\nEnquiries:\nIlika Plc\nGraeme Purdy, Chief Executive\nJason Stewart, Chief Financial Officer\nwww.ilika.com\nVia FTI Consulting\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nPeter Lynch\nNeil McDonald\n+44 (0)131 220 9772\n+44 (0)131 220 9771\nFTI Consulting (Comms Advisors)\nBen Brewerton\nElizabeth Adams\nDwight Burden\nilika@fticonsulting.com\nAbout Ilika plc\n-\nhttps://www.ilika.com\nIlika is a global expert in the development of solid state battery technology for electric vehicles, medical devices and consumer appliances. The Company's pioneering next-generation technologies aim to provide scalable, affordable alternatives to conventional batteries, to industries which need to incorporate a smaller, lighter, and safer power source in their products.\nThe Company has two product lines.
