The Company is also pleased to report that the NSTA has approved the Company's request to assign a 50% working interest in both licence P2498 and licence P2170 (\"Verbier\") to NEO Energy (\"NEO\"), as part of the recently announced Greater Buchan Area farm-out transaction.\nThe Second Term of licence P2498 has been extended by 18 months to 28 February 2025. The extension was requested in order to provide the licensees with the time required to prepare a Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") for the redevelopment of the Buchan field, which is planned for submission to the NSTA during 2024. Following FDP approval the licence moves into the Third Term, which covers the development and production phase of activities for the life of the field.\nFollowing these approvals, the Company has now satisfied the conditions precedent associated with the farm-out of the 50% interest in licence P2498 to NEO. In terms of the P2170 licence assignment to NEO, the Company is in the process of completing the final outstanding condition precedent.

Following completion of the transaction, operatorship of the licences will transfer to NEO.\nThe Company will be working in partnership with NEO to select the preferred development solution, having confirmed a short list of attractive options for the GBA which utilise existing North Sea infrastructure. The unstable fiscal conditions resulting from the introduction and revision of the Energy Profits Levy during 2022 have been challenging. As the joint venture moves forward towards first oil, which is targeted for 2026, it will be mindful of the future fiscal attractiveness of the UK.\nThe Company intends to farm-out additional equity in the GBA licences in order to ultimately retain a 20-25% carried interest in the development following FDP approval. NEO has an option to increase its 50% interest in the Buchan licence by up to an additional 37.5% in exchange for a further cash payment should any of JOG's equity share in the development remain unfunded ahead of FDP submission,\nwith such payment being the pro-rated balance of future cash payments due to JOG post completion in relation to the GBA development solution and Buchan FDP as outlined above.\nJOG remains well funded for its on-going and planned work programmes, with a cash balance of approximately \u00a36.5 million as at 31 December 2022. It is intended that the cash payments anticipated to be received from NEO following completion of the transaction will be utilised to pursue the Company's stated growth strategy and provide additional working capital for the Company.\nThe Company intends to issue its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2022 in the second half of May 2023.\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to announce this transaction with NEO Energy, a well-funded industry heavyweight and the fifth largest producer in the UKCS. The farm-out marks a major value creation moment for JOG, a significant de-risking of the GBA development programme, from both an operational and funding perspective, and provides the springboard from which to grow the long-term value of the business. We are looking forward to working collaboratively with NEO Energy to select the optimal development solution for the GBA and taking the project through to sanction and on into future production.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz, CEO\nC/o Camarco:\nTel: 020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nfinnCap Ltd\nChristopher Raggett\nTim Redfern\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\nAdditional Information\nThe Company's GBA interests comprise the P2498 and P2170 licences, which contain the Buchan oil field, the J2 and Verbier oil discoveries and a number of exploration prospects.\nThe farm-out agreements contain representations, warranties and indemnities given by the Company to NEO in relation to, amongst other things, title and capacity to the GBA licences. The Company's maximum aggregate liability under such warranties and indemnities is limited to an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash payments and costs carried by NEO under the agreement (to the extent such amounts are received).
