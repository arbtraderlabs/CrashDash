          "content": "9 Jul 2024 09:35\nRNS Number : 6807V\nClontarf Energy PLC\n09 July 2024\n9 July 2024\nClontarf Energy plc\n(\"Clontarf\" or \"the Company\")\nCorporate Update\nThe Directors of Clontarf Energy plc (AIM: CLON) are pleased to provide a corporate update which will be presented to shareholders at todays AGM.\nThe main corporate activity has been driving ahead\nClontarf Energy's proposals under the Bolivian convocatoria, or 'call for expressions of interest' in developing Bolivian Lithium brines.\nClontarf is now in Phase 4 of a 5 Phase process, which now focuses on maturity of the offered technologies. Stream 1 covers companies claiming to be already operating Direct Lithium Extraction plants. Stream 2 includes operators with an existing technology and plants being commissioned. Clontarf was initially placed in Stream 3, but now expects to be treated as Stream 2, since the joint venture's plant now awaits bulk samples for production testing.\nClontarf's joint venture partner, NEXT-ChemX, is assembling, and commissioning a Direct Lithium Extraction pilot plant, which is preparing synthetic brines for preliminary testing based on chemical compositions recorded from our sampling of priority salares.\nClontarf has therefore applied for bulk samples to be collected on its behalf, by the State Lithium Company under applicable rules, from at least two salares. One of these is expected to be high-grade Lithium, and the other including major Magnesium content, as well as attractive Lithium content. This may confirm the output, purity and operating costs of the likely range of brines to be processed. On receipt, these samples will be sea-freighted to our joint venture's pilot plant near Mumbai, India.\nActual production testing will start immediately after arrival at site, as a priority. Bolivian technical experts are invited to attend the production testing, to confirm results.\nReflecting the current maturity of our joint venture's Direct Lithium Extraction pilot plant, Clontarf expects sample delivery to be expedited and Clontarf to be effectively promoted to Stream 2 of the technology confirmation process. This may immediately follow negotiations with the 3 Chinese and one Italian company who state that they already have DLE operations.\nSigning of convenios, and possibly contracts, may follow successful testing and negotiations of terms and conditions. We anticipate deploying plants to one or more Bolivian salares thereafter.\n\u25cf\nDavid Horgan, Chairman, commented\n:\n\"\nEurope needs offtake of\npure\nBolivian Lithium, while Bolivia needs to export battery-grade Lithium.\"\n\"No one company or country can grapple with China and NAFTA. Accordingly, Clontarf is part off Team\nEurope's programme to secure adequate supplies of Lithium and other priority minerals. This initiative is promoted by the EU Commission, and supported by the Critical Resource Minerals Act, as well as the wider 'Global Gateway' initiative\".\n\"\nDemand for Lithium carbonate equivalent grew 30% to circa 930 thousand tonnes in 2023.\nNew projects struggle to deliver the supply needed. Dirty sourcing, especially of hard rock ores, conflict with the clean, Green image EV marketers depend on. The answer is clean brines' processing, which may - in time - earn a price premium.\"\n\"EU Commission leadership has been key in financing necessary infrastructure, especially through the 'Global Gateway' initiative. The EU was initially slow to respond to the Chinese challenge, but now moves decisively - backed by circa \u20ac400 billion of possible financing. 20-year money at a 3.3% coupon convinces many counter-parties. They are saying it with cash, as well as markets and strategic partnerships. The EU does not bring the historical baggage handicapping other power-blocs.\n\"\n\"Bolivia is not for beginners. Therefore, Clontarf has developed a strategy, with off-taker support, to operate, if necessary, under existing laws and\nConstitution. But we expect progress to be helped by the local community royalties and ESG expenditure proposed to Congress under the shortly-to-be updated 2017 Lithium Law. This may confirm the legality of joint ventures, answer legitimate community queries, and best align the stakeholder interests.\"\n\"\nEurope will thereby source secure, as well as clean raw materials. Locals will benefit from infrastructural investments, a share in re-invested profits, shared services & technology transfer.\"\n\"We seek enduring partnerships, rather than employees\".\nFurther updates will be provided, as appropriate, in accordance with necessary clearances from the authorities.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014.\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://clontarfenergy.com\nor contact:\nClontarf Energy\nDavid Horgan, Chairman\nJim Finn, Director\n+353 (0) 1 833 2833\nNominated & Financial Adviser\nStrand Hanson Limited\nRory Murphy\nRitchie Balmer\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nBroker\nNovum Securities Limited\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0) 207 399 9400\nPublic Relations\nBlytheRay\nMegan Ray\n+44 (0) 207 138 3206\nTeneo\nLuke Hogg\nAlan Tyrrell\nFia Long\nAlan Reynolds\n+353 (0) 1 661 4055\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

It is expected that the joint venture will demonstrate the technical, commercial and environmental feasibility of NEXT-ChemX's ion-Targeting Direct lithium Extraction (\"\niTDE\n\") technology in Bolivia.\nThis process included further sampling in priority salt-lakes, as well as working with regulatory bodies and other licence-holders to collect representative samples. The first phase of sample analysis is confirming past laboratory testing of synthetic brines. This process includes fine-tuning the process so as to facilitate large-scale pilot plant testing, which should follow successful laboratory test-work.\nOngoing discussions with Bolivia's State Lithium Company, which is tasked with leading Bolivia's entry to international markets under the 2017 Lithium Law, have been a priority.\nThe Company has also agreed, with the relevant title-holders, to test priority brines from privately-held salt-lakes in Argentina and Chile. These are also included in the NEXT-ChemX joint venture on Direct Lithium Extraction (\"\nDLE\n\").\nFor many years Clontarf has promoted Bolivia's brine potential, especially for Lithium. Until recently, markets were sceptical about demand projections, as well as the need for higher purities and minimising problematic residuals. Now these needs are widely understood, with high demand growth forecast by US, EU and British authorities. Rising quality requirements have also boosted prices, increasing the sector's profitability.\nBut at the very time when demand is surging, there has been subdued investment in development and especially exploration. There has been opposition to expanding European mines, especially, often most vigorously from those simultaneously clamouring for a \"Green transition\". Even high levels of recycling cannot fuel a rapidly expanding market. A further complication is that recycling recoveries are often low, due to how such minerals are combined, in small percentages, in complex products like batteries.\nSuch rising demand for most resources, especially critical metals and minerals, cannot be supplied from existing sources, by traditional methods. Output and quality need to be increased simultaneously, while minimising use of water, space, ore and other materials - and all with a limited environmental footprint.\nThe Directors believe the only way these lithium demand needs can be served at scale is through DLE. Traditional evaporation ponds\nallied with chemical precipitation\nwork too slowly and imperfectly - often with recoveries of only 40% to 60%. But so far there is no commercial DLE working worldwide.\nIn April 2023, a senior Bolivian government official asked how could we be so confident when there is currently no operating, commercial DLE facility in South America?\nWe answered that setting objectives gives substance to the vision. By naming DLE we make it possible. After that, it's about resources and perseverance - as long as the processes doesn't defy the laws of chemistry or physics. There is also scope for serendipity - a mouldy growth spotted by Fleming's inquiring eye opening the door to antibiotics.\nFor years we have worked in industrial minerals, investigating emerging technologies in Germany, the USA and Asia. Some techniques achieved reasonable output, but at low recoveries. Some delivered good output, but with deleterious contaminants and inadequate grade. A few deliver acceptable purities, but not commercially.\nThe mining industry is conservative,\nlacking imagination, fearing the alien and disruptive. It has necessarily focused on burning lithium-rich hard rock ores, mainly in Western Australia and southern Africa. However, few ores have the grade and minerology necessary to produce adequate lithium salt volumes in such ways. Burning rocks for days at 800\n\u00b0\nC, usually in coal-fired Chinese furnaces, is too dirty to be credibly clean enough for the \"Green transition\" of electric vehicles (EVs) or grid storage. EV buyers now account for 80% of lithium demand, and it is only a matter of time until they become more discriminating.\nTraditional miners tend to resist alternative thinking, merely extending what worked before. But incremental innovation cannot satisfy anticipated demand growth. The extractive industry must provide a \"fair trade\" lithium, which is low emission and low water use, but also able to deliver sustainable volumes for many years, and whose economic benefits are fairly shared with local people.\nBreakthroughs require innovative thinking, which rarely unfolds in an orderly, predictable, or easily managed way. You must imagine solutions that are not yet there. One answer is to find a successful process working in different applications, in other jurisdictions.\nInnovation occurs elsewhere and is applied in new ways: working with our joint venture partners, NEXT-ChemX, we identified techniques that had previously purified fluids of radioactive elements through a technique mimicking the human kidney. This avoids the need for high water, or power usage, facilitating a continuous process, rather than batch process.\nThis cutting-edge extraction technology concentrates desired ions (e.g. Li+) by drawing them out of a solution (such as a brine) across a special purpose membrane using a technology iTDE, which can work in low concentrations.\nSuch inventions are the tangible\nrealising of a vision\n.\nEven creators may not initially see the whole potential, or disruption as invention\ndestroys the cherished and understood past\n.\nThat's why incumbents are so reluctant to disrupt, because innovation is emerging, and non-linear creative destruction.\nIt has been harder to get investors excited about oil & gas exploration. For juniors to boom we really need a positive stock market, and ideally a strong farm-out market.\nOver recent months we have transferred funds to our Australian 10% Working Interest\n, on which the partners drilled the\nSasanof-1 well in May/June 2022. While this well did not flow commercial hydrocarbons, it showed that 1,000m offshore wells can again be funded. Clontarf's liquidity and international contacts helped attract funding above the share price. That punter optimism slowed with the non-commercial well and moderating of the Asian LNG price to circa $11 per million BTU. The strong recovery in Asian demand, as China emerged from a series of lock-downs, and the desire to displace coal, promised future demand growth. A possible concern is the Australian Federal Government policy review on fossil fuel exports (which may import EPA approvals for new projects) - though the WA State authorities remain supportive.\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine, and sabotage of the Nordsteam pipelines (with a combined capacity of 110bcm - vs the pre-war Russian gas exports to Europe of 155bcm) now make Liquified Natural Gas (\"\nLNG\n\") critical for the European gas market.\nAs well as this Clontarf has restored contacts with the Ghanaian authorities to update the acreage to be explored and resuscitate the ratification of its signed Petroleum Agreement on Tano 2A Block. Slowness in ratification of signed contracts had constrained the development of Ghana's oil and gas industry. The current Ghanaian government has indicated its determination to recover momentum, working with the IMF to overcome Covid-19 and legacy liabilities. Ghanaian fiscal terms remain competitive, while West African infrastructure steadily improves.\nTo expedite the long-delayed ratification of our acreage, the authorities have floated the proposal for alternative acreage, in the neighbouring region. While some of the acreage has interesting plays that would attract interest in a better market, it does not compare with the original Tano 2A acreage - or indeed, neighbouring acreage bordering discoveries since 2008. We are keen to work out a mutually attractive solution that will enable ratification and bringing in of larger partners to explore this acreage, and hopefully develop any discovery.\nWe remain in contact on Chad (where we signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2020) and other prospective African countries. So far, the main hurdle has been the requested fiscal terms - which reflect the hot market of 2003 through 2014, rather than current investor hostility to petroleum and the retrenchment of some western majors who would otherwise be our go-to partners for such frontier exploration.\nHowever, the petroleum industry is cyclical, and the extreme under-investment in the sector since 2010 is now creating shortages as demand recovers, especially in Asia. Demand for oil, gas and even coal are now at or near historic records, while investment is mostly limited to developments of existing Blocks in mature basins. That will change.\nFinancial markets and farm-out interest in petroleum had been depressed since the oil price war starting in 2014 and continuing periodically until 2022. This had constrained our options for early seismic or wells in Ghana or Chad. But recent price volatility shows that major new investment is required to service global demand. Clontarf plans to participate in the coming boom.\nAnticipated lithium salts' demand cannot be served without developing DLE technology, including on several Bolivian salt-lakes. We are now involved in a sample testing process, and additionally expect that the Bolivian Lithium Law will be updated to confirm the legal basis for Joint Ventures with the authorities.\nIn oil and gas, the tightening hydrocarbons' supply-demand balance promises a revival of exploration and the farm-out market.\nThe resurgence of interest in African exploration and development may lead to additional proposals in the coming months.\nIn summary, Clontarf has progressed its interests in Bolivia, Australia, and Africa, maintaining cordial communications with the relevant authorities, and has continued to operate efficiently on minimal expenditure.\nFunding\nClontarf has successfully fundraised two times since May 2022. With the greatest interest among Australian and Asian investors. Subject to technical verification of its exploration projects, and permitting, Clontarf is confident of adequate funding, whether in London or Australia, for near to medium term ongoing activities.\nDavid Horgan\nChairman\n7th June 2023\nCLONTARF ENERGY PLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n2022\n\u00a3\n2021\n\u00a3\nAdministrative expenses\n(671,352)\n(401,427)\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets\n(4,095,294)\n(62,074)\nLoss from operations\n(4,766,646)\n(463,501)\nLoss before tax\n(4,766,646)\n(463,501)\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income\n(4,766,646)\n(463,501)\nEarnings per share attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent\n2022\n2021\nPence\nPence\nLoss per share - basic and diluted\n(0.26)\n(0.06)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2022\n2022\n\u00a3\n2021\n\u00a3\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n868,043\n868,043\n868,043\n868,043\nCurrent assets\nOther receivables\n-\n1,934\nCash and cash equivalents\n931,902\n344,253\n931,902\n346,187\nTotal assets\n1,799,945\n1,214,230\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other liabilities\n(3,026,514)\n(1,485,848)\nTotal liabilities\n(3,026,514)\n(1,485,848)\nNet liabilities\n(1,226,569)\n(271,618)\nEquity\nShare capital\n5,927,065\n2,177,065\nShare premium reserve\n10,985,758\n10,985,758\nShare based payment reserve\n247,838\n186,143\nRetained deficit\n(18,387,230)\n(13,620,584)\nTotal equity\n(1,226,569)\n(271,618)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\nShare\nCapital\n\u00a3\nShare\nPremium\nReserve\n\u00a3\nShare\nBased\nPayment\nReserve\n\u00a3\nRetained\nDeficit\n\u00a3\nTotal\nEquity\n\u00a3\nAt 1 January 2021\n1,792,450\n10,900,373\n103,879\n(13,157,083)\n(360,381)\nIssue of share capital\n384,615\n115,385\n-\n-\n500,000\nShare issue expenses\n-\n(30,000)\n(30,000)\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n82,264\n-\n82,264\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(463,501)\n(463,501)\nAt 31 December 2021\n2,177,065\n10,985,758\n186,143\n(13,620,584)\n(271,618)\nIssue of share capital\n3,750,000\n-\n-\n-\n3,750,000\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n61,695\n-\n61,695\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(4,766,646)\n(4,766,646)\nAt 31 December 2022\n5,927,065\n10,985,758\n247,838\n(18,387,230)\n(1,226,569)\nCONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n2022\n\u00a3\n2021\n\u00a3\nCash flows from operating activities\nLoss for the year\n(4,766,646)\n(463,501)\nAdjustments for\nShare based payment charge\n61,695\n82,264\nForeign exchange loss\n3,442\n1,516\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets\n4,095,294\n62,074\n(606,215)\n(317,647)\nMovements in working capital:\nDecrease/(Increase) in other receivables\n1,934\n(148)\nIncrease in trade and other payables\n1,540,666\n119,141\nNet cash used in operating activities\n936,385\n(198,654)\nCash flows from investing activities\nAdditions to exploration and evaluation assets\n(4,095,294)\n(15,000)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(4,095,294)\n(15,000)\nCash flows from financing activities\nIssue of Ordinary Shares\n3,750,000\n500,000\nShare issue expenses\n-\n(30,000)\nNet cash generated from financing activities\n3,750,000\n470,000\nNet cash increase in cash and cash equivalents\n591,091\n256,346\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of year\n344,253\n89,423\nExchange loss on cash and cash equivalents\n(3,442)\n(1,516)\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the year\n931,902\n344,253\nNotes:\n1.

GOING CONCERN\nThe Group incurred\na loss for the year of \u00a34,766,646 (2021: \u00a3463,501) and had net current liabilities of \u00a32,094,612 (2021: \u00a31,139,661) at the balance sheet date. These conditions, as well as those noted below, represent a material uncertainty that may cast doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nIncluded in current liabilities is an amount of \u00a31,525,565 (2021: \u00a31,420,565) owed to Directors in respect of Directors' remuneration due at the balance sheet date. The Directors have confirmed that they will not seek settlement of these amounts in cash until after end of 2024.\nThe Group had a cash balance of \u00a3931,902 (2021: \u00a3344,253) at the balance sheet date. The Directors have prepared cashflow projections for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements which indicate that the group may require additional finance to fund working capital requirements and develop existing projects. As the Group is not revenue or cash generating it relies on raising capital from the public market. On 16 January 2023 the Group raised \u00a31,300,000 on a placing and a further \u00a3350,000 was raised on 1 June 2023, further information is detailed in Note 6 of these accounts.\nAs in previous years the Directors have given careful consideration to the appropriateness of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements and believe the going concern basis is appropriate for these financial statements. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\n4.

The Directors are aware that by its nature there is an inherent uncertainty in exploration and evaluation assets and therefore inherent uncertainty in relation to the carrying value of capitalised exploration and evaluation assets.\nOn 9 May 2022 the Company\nacquired a 10\nper cent.\ninterest in the high-impact multi-TCF (Trillion Cubic Feet) Sasanof exploration prospect (located mainly within Exploration Permit\nWA-519-P\n) through the acquisition of a 10 per cent. interest in Western Gas, which wholly owns the prospect.\nThe Acquisition consideration comprised of a cash consideration of US$4,000,000, and 100,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the Company. In the event of a discovery being declared at the Sasanof-1 Well, further consideration would have been payable.\nOn 6 June 2022 the Company announced that no commercial hydrocarbons were intersected and the Sasanof-1 Well would be plugged and permanently abandoned. De-mobilisation activities commenced. Accordingly, the total costs of \u00a34,095,294 incurred on the Sasanof-1 Well were written off in full in the current year.\nDuring 2018 the Group resolved the outstanding issues with the Ghana National Petroleum Company (GNPC) regarding a contract for the development of the Tano 2A Block. The Group has signed a Petroleum Agreement in relation to the block and this agreement awaits ratification by the Ghanian government.\nThe Company is in negotiations with the Vice-Ministry of Electrical Technologies and the State Lithium Company in Bolivia on exploration and development of salt-lakes in accordance with law. Samples have been analysed and process work is underway.\nThe Directors believe that there were no facts or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the remaining intangible assets may exceed their recoverable amount and thus no impairment review was deemed necessary by the Directors. The realisation of these intangibles assets is dependent on the successful discovery and development of economic deposit resources and the ability of the Group to raise sufficient finance to develop the projects. It is subject to a number of potential significant risks, as set out below:\n\u00b7\nlicence obligations;\n\u00b7\nexchange rate risks;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties over development and operational costs;\n\u00b7\npolitical and legal risks, including arrangements with governments for licences, profit sharing and taxation;\n\u00b7\nforeign investment risks including increases in taxes, royalties and renegotiation of contracts;\n\u00b7\ntitle to assets;\n\u00b7\nfinancial risk management;\n\u00b7\ngoing concern; and\n\u00b7\nability to raise finance.\nIncluded in the additions for the year are \u00a3Nil (2021: \u00a315,000) of Directors' remuneration. The remaining balance pertains to the amounts capitalised to the respective projects held by the entity.\n5.

The carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.\nOther payables relate to amounts due to Directors' remuneration of \u00a31,525,565 (2021: \u00a31,420,565) accrued but not paid at year end.\nCreditor - Western Gas relate to cash calls due for costs incurred on the Sasanof-1 Well accrued but not paid at period end.\n6.

Further information relating to Share Options is outlined in Note 7.\n7. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS\nThe Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and individuals who have performed services for the Group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Shares granted to individuals and Directors will vest 3 years from the period that the awards relates.\nFair value is measured by the use of a Black-Scholes model.\nThe Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.\nShare Options\n31 December 2022\n31 December 2021\nOptions\nWeighted average exercise price in pence\nOptions\nWeighted average exercise price in pence\nOutstanding at beginning of year\n40,500,000\n0.7\n40,500,000\n0.7\nIssued\n-\n-\n-\n-\nExpired\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOutstanding at end of year\n40,500,000\n0.7\n40,500,000\n0.7\nExercisable at end of year\n40,500,000\n0.7\n30,500,000\n0.7\nDuring 2019 40,500,000 options were granted with a fair value of \u00a3246,788.

The accrued liability as at 31 December 2021 for the three longest serving Directors (Dr Teeling, Mr Horgan and Mr Finn) was \u00a31,340,564. The Board remains cognisant of the need to conserve cash resources in the current environment and therefore these three Directors have agreed to continue deferring payment of this amount, in cash, until the end of 2024.\nIn consideration for this past and continued deferral, these Directors have been issued 3.25 warrants over ordinary shares per each 1p of accrued salary due until 31 December 2021. The Warrants are exercisable at 0.25p at any time until 11 January 2025 and have been allocated as follows:\nAccrued salary (\u00a3)\nWarrants exercisable at conversion price of 0.25p per share\nDavid Horgan\n\u00a3569,037\n184,937,025\nJohn Teeling (resigned 1 July 2022)\n\u00a3395,704\n128,603,800\nJames Finn\n\u00a3375,823\n122,142,475\nAccordingly, in aggregate, 435,683,300 Warrants have been issued to the above Directors.
