We eliminate the barriers to clean energy generation and energy waste reduction, offering solutions that don't require upfront capital investment. Our vision is clear: make Net Zero possible and profitable for every organisation.\nOur primary services include:\n\u00b7\nReduce\n: LED lighting and controls\n\u00b7\nGenerate\n: Solar PV, ground mount, rooftop, and carport\n\u00b7\nCharge\n: EV charging and management software\nAll eEnergy's services come with intelligent circuit-level energy analytics and are funded through NatWest or Siemens to provide an off-balance sheet-compliant energy-as-a-service solution.\neEnergy has completed over 1,100 decarbonisation projects within the B2B and public sector. We are #1 in the education sector, having worked with over 840 schools, installing over half a million LED lights, and improving the learning environment for over 443,000 students-enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over. In one year alone, eEnergy has saved the education sector \u00a313 million in energy costs. With over 70% of schools yet to transition to LED lighting and over 90% yet to deploy solar, eEnergy estimates that at least \u00a35.4 billion would need to be invested to install adequate rooftop solar, LED lighting, and EV charging infrastructure in UK schools.\n-ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
