Revenue was up at \u00a37.377m (2016: \u00a36.635m). The profit before tax was 5.6% down at \u00a3687k (2016: \u00a3728k), the previous year having benefitted from the windfall drop in Sterling after the Brexit referendum as I reported in my last full year's statement.\nWe sell all over the world, with exports increasing by 18%, but our performance has been very patchy in nearly all of our markets, with some doing much better than expected, some worse.\nAlthough it is only a relatively short time since the end of September, we have to say that sales generally have weakened, particularly in the U.K. market, where the number of projects in the pipeline have decreased, not enormously but perhaps significantly. As always, it is difficult to forecast how this will affect the twelve months figures.\nFor the future, it is perhaps trite to say that we would prefer more clarity, but we would.\nWe are proposing an interim dividend of 5.5p per share (2016: deferred interim dividend of 5.5p), which will be paid on 23 March 2018.\nSam Heath\nChairman\n9th November 2017\nFor further information, please

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF INTERIM REPORT\nAs permitted, IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting' has not been applied in this interim report. The information for the period ended 30 September 2017 is not audited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017 were given an unqualified audit report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The interim accounts for the half year ended 30 September 2016 were also unaudited.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of accounting\nThe report has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") at 30 September 2017 as well as all interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\") at 30 September 2017.\nThe group has not availed itself of early adoption options in such standards and interpretations.\nThe principal accounting policies adopted are as set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2017. The valuation of inventories is considered to be the main area in terms of significant accounting estimates and judgements.\nThe retirement benefit scheme liability recognised in these interim accounts reflects the estimated change in the deficit at 30 September 2017 from the movements in discount rates and inflation during the six months.\n3. DIVIDENDS\nAn Interim dividend of 5.5p per share is proposed, payable on 23 March 2018. (30 September 2016: nil, although a deferred interim dividend was paid in August 2017 of 5.5p)\n4. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the relevant profit after taxation of \u00a3556,000 (30 September 2016: \u00a3579,000) by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period being 2,534,322 (2016: 2,534,322). The number of shares used in the calculation is the same for both basic and diluted earnings.\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nIR BRBDBUSGBGRR"
