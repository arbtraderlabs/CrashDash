Once the political situation has settled down the Company is hopeful of converting this Service Agreement into a Production Sharing Agreement.\nThe Company accepted the invitation and sent in its proposals on how it would like to proceed with a work program.\nOnce a decision has been made, shareholders will be immediately informed through the RNS news service.\nAlthough the Company is fully committed to establishing profitable Sudanese oil production in 2024, it will however pursue any attractive opportunities that present themselves in neighbouring countries such as Chad, South Sudan, Niger, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Libya.\n2) AUDITOR\nWildcat Petroleum for accountancy purposes is classified as a Public Interest Entity (PIE).\nThe auditor Shipleys LLP no longer provides auditing services to PIE companies; resultantly they were forced to resign. A firm that does provide auditing services to PIE companies has been identified and will be engaged in due course and an announcement made via RNS once the relevant paperwork has been completed.\nWe would like to thank Shipleys for the excellent and efficient service they provided the Company and wish them well for the future.\n3)\nCRYPTO/BLOCKCHAIN PLANS\nThe current position is that no blockchain activities and token offerings will take place before the Company has implemented its investment strategy to acquire an upstream oil and gas asset and it has published a prospectus in line with its Listing Rule obligations.\nThe Company would like to thank shareholders for their support during 2023.\nWe hope to repay this support in 2024.\nBest Wishes\nMandhir Singh (Chairman)\nWildcat Petroleum plc\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.
