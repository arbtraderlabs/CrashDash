He brings sharp strategic instinct and industry depth. His experience and customer contacts will be invaluable as we execute the next phase of our growth strategy.\n\"On behalf of the Board and the wider ITM team, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his stewardship, wise counsel, and unwavering support over the past years. His commitment and leadership helped guide the Company through a crucial phase of transformation.\"\nJ\u00fcrgen Nowicki said: \"I am deeply honoured to take on the role of Chair at ITM during this pivotal moment in the Company's growth. As we continue to lead the charge in green hydrogen innovation, I firmly believe that this technology will play a central role in the global energy transition. ITM stands at the forefront of this transformation, uniquely positioned with its cutting-edge technology and robust manufacturing capabilities.\n\"Having had the privilege of working with Dennis previously, I'm excited to renew our partnership. Together, we will accelerate ITM's growth and enhance long-term value.\n\"Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Sir Roger Bone for his outstanding leadership, commitment, and contributions to ITM.

The project was recently shortlisted as part of the UK's Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2).\nITM will deploy six 20MW POSEIDON core electrolysis process modules into the project. POSEIDON offers unmatched efficiency, rapid response times, and an optimised footprint for large-scale projects.\nThe Humber H2ub\u00ae (Green) project is a planned green hydrogen production facility at Uniper's Killingholme site. Its initial capacity will be 120MW, with the future potential expansion of a further 200MW+. In March 2024, Uniper and Phillips 66 Limited signed a collaboration agreement to work together towards supplying green hydrogen from the Humber H2ub\u00ae (Green) project to the Phillips 66 Limited Humber Refinery to replace some refinery fuel gas in industrial-scale fired heaters.\nThe project is subject to a Final Investment Decision (FID), which is expected in 2026 and targeted to be operational by 2029.\nDennis Schulz, CEO, said, \"We are delighted that Uniper has selected us for their large-scale green hydrogen project in the UK, which will contribute to the decarbonisation of the Humber Refinery and create skilled job opportunities at Killingholme and the surrounding area.\"\nJan Taschenberger, Uniper COO New Green Power and Gas, said, \"This is a key milestone for the project, and we are looking forward to working with ITM Power and further developing the engineering for the project built around the ITM Power 20MW POSEIDON modules.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.itm-power.com\nor contact:\nITM Power PLC\nJustin Scarborough, Head of Investor Relations\n+44 (0)114 551 1080\nBerenberg\nCiaran Walsh, Harry Nicholas\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nJ.P.
