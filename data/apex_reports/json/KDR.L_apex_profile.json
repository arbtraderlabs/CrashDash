The results indicate the presence of a diamond stability field and, in turn, the presence of diamond bearing kimberlite likely to be the source of the diamond.\nDiscovery of the source of the green diamond could be particularly significant as coloured diamonds, including green diamonds, sell for prices which can be multiples of those for clear colourless diamonds.\nSixty garnets from a series of locations were submitted to Renaud Geological Consulting Ltd in\nCanada\nfor detailed Electron Microprobe Analysis, having been picked from till samples by Overburden Drilling Management Limited (\"ODM\") (as announced by the Company on\n19 December 2023\n).\nThe Microprobe analysis resulted in the identification of nineteen G10 (harzburgitic), nineteen G9 (lherzolitic), fifteen G5 (pyroxenitic) and seven G4 (eclogitic) garnets.\nThe presence of diamond stability field garnets (G10D) and other diamond-facies garnets (G4D and G5D) is a clear indicator of the diamond potential of the Kuhmo target area. (See Table 1).\nEclogitic\nPeridotitic\nPyroxenitic\nTOTAL\nDiamond facies\nSample number\nG4\nLow-Ca Eclogitic/ Pyroxenitic\nG10 Harzburgitic\nG9 Lherzolitic\nG5 Pyroxenitic\nAnalysed garnets total\nG10D (inside the Diamond Stability Field)\nG4D\n(Na\n2\nO \u2265 0,07 wt-%)\nG5D\n(Na\n2\nO \u2265 0,07 wt-%)\nA5-23-01\n1\n9\n3\n4\n17\n2\n1\nA5-23-02\n2\n1\n3\nA5-23-03\n3\n7\n6\n7\n23\n1\n5\nA5-23-07\n1\n1\n2\nA5-23-09\n1\n1\n2\n1\n5\n1\n1\nA5-23-09B\n1\n1\nA5-23-17\n1\n1\nA5-23-19\n1\n1\nA5-23-21\n1\n1\nA5-23-23\n1\n1\n2\n1\nA5-23-25\n1\n1\n2\nA5-23-29\n1\n1\nA5-23-32\n1\n1\nTotal\n7\n19\n19\n15\n60\n3\n3\n6\nTable 1: Classification of results of electron microprobe analysis.\nThe table shows the total numbers of garnets recovered from each of the locations tested and the related diamond facies.\nFurther confirmation that the sample material was derived from the diamond stability field of the Earth's mantle is shown in a conventional CaO versus Cr\n2\nO\n3\ncontents plot for the sixty garnets analysed. (See Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Conventional diagram of CaO versus Cr\n2\nO\n3\ncontents (wt.%) of the 60 garnets recovered from Kuhmo Green Diamond Target sampling, with G-number classification (from Gr\u00fctter et al, 2004).\nThe discovery of the green diamond down-ice, together with the abundance of G10 harzburgitic garnets, including G10D's, and the presence of eclogitic G4 garnets, including G4D's, and pyroxenitic G5D garnets, all indicate a deep-mantle source for kimberlite originating from the diamond stability field where diamonds are formed.\nThe results indicate that two of the sample locations (A5-23-01 and A5-23-03) are likely to be very close to the kimberlitic source of the green diamond.\nThis release has been approved by Andrew Murrells PGeo, who is a member of the Company's technical staff and holds a\nBSc in Geological and Earth Sciences\n/Geosciences\n[NA1]\n, in accordance with the guidance note for Mining, Oil & Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM Companies, which outlines standards of disclosure for mineral projects.\nProfessor\nRichard Conroy\n, Chairman of Karelian Diamond Resources PLC commented:\n\"\nThese results are a further and very important step forward in bringing to a successful conclusion the search for the origin of the green diamond discovered by the Company in the Kuhmo region of\nFinland\n.\"\nNote: The microprobe used for the electron microprobe analysis was a JEOL JXA-733 Superprobe equipped with 5 wavelength dispersive spectrometers (WDS) and an Oxford Instruments X-act energy dispersive system (EDS).\nSamples were run at 15KV, beam current 15na, beam diameter of 5um.\nCount times for major elements were 20s on peak and 10s on each side of the peak for background measurements. For trace elements, both peak and background times were 40s.\nFor calibration a set of microbeam standards of pure metals (from SPI) and natural minerals from the Smithsonian Institution were utilized (Jarosewich, 2002). Data reduction was performed using the ZAF correction.\nFurther Information:\nProfessor Richard Conroy, Chairman\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n3958298_0.jpeg\n3958298_1.jpeg"

The reservation provides a one-year privilege to apply for an exploration permit in the area.\nThe Lentiira area is considered highly prospective by the Company. Several orangeite dikes with highly prospective indicator mineral compositions were discovered in the area by European Diamonds PLC in the early 2000s, and diamonds were discovered by till sampling in a number of locations.\nConsidering the fact that the ultimate sources of the main indicator fans still remain unlocated, the exploration possibilities for the Company in the Lentiira area are intriguing.\nThe Company has submitted an application to TUKES for an uninterrupted extension of the exploration permit, Kuhmo 1, where a follow-up excavation programme was recently completed up-ice of the green diamond discovery (as announced by the Company on\n25 September 2024\n).\nThe results of this programme are expected in the first quarter of 2025. The Company plans to continue its exploration programme in the Kuhmo region in 2025 focussing in particular on the green diamond target area where a high priority drilling target has already been identified from the detailed electromagnetic survey conducted over the Company's green diamond target area, the results of which were announced on\n24 January 2025\n.\nThe exploration permit, Seitaper\u00e4, covering the Seitaper\u00e4 diamondiferous kimberlite (orangeite) in Kuhmo, circa 6 kilometres to the southwest of the exploration permit Kuhmo 1, has been extended for a further 3 year period by TUKES in\nMarch 2024\n. Karelian has shown the Seitaper\u00e4 kimberlite to be the largest known kimberlite in\nFinland\n, extending over a surface area of 6.9 hectares.\nAs announced by the Company on\n25 January 2024\n, extensions for the exploration permits, Riihivaara 26, Riihivaara 24, 24A and\n24B\nin Kuhmo, were granted by TUKES for further 3 years from\nJanuary 2024\n.\nThe Riihivaara 26 exploration permit covers Karelian Diamond's kimberlite (olivine lamproite) discovery at Riihivaara, circa 10 kilometres to the south of the exploration permit Kuhmo 1.\nAll of the above-mentioned Karelian licence areas in Kuhmo, combined with the new reservation extending the area of interest north to Lentiira, may together prove to become a significant diamond province on the Finnish side of the Karelian Craton.\nIn addition, new exploration permits at Liperi, in the Joensuu region of\nEastern Finland\n, and Salla, in Lapland of\nFinland\n, have been recently granted.\nLahtojoki Diamond Deposit\nThe Company expects to finalise all outstanding aspects of the landowner compensation in the second quarter of 2025. As set out in the Company's announcement of\n18 October 2024\nthe decision of the Land Court has now gained legal force with only three matters remaining to be finalised with the National Land Survey. The court hearing was in relation to appeals by two landowners regarding amounts of compensation to be paid to them and the mine boundary itself at the Company's proposed mine development at Lahtojoki, in the Kuopio Kaavi region of\nFinland\n.\nA mining concession application for the Lahtojoki diamond deposit has already been approved by TUKES.\nThe Company is reaching out to potential strategic partners to advance the Company's proposed development of the Lahtojoki diamond deposit.\nFinalisation of the mine boundary and landowner compensation is an essential step in progressing this development.\nNorthern Ireland Nickel, Copper and Platinum Group Metals Projects\nAn assessment prepared by independent geological consultant, Dr\nLarry Hulbert\n, announced on\n24 June 2024\n, confirms the potential for Nickel, Copper, and Platinum-Group Elements (\"PGE\"), in the Company's license areas in\nNorthern Ireland\n, following the discovery by the Company of indicator minerals for Nickel, Copper and PGE, during the course of a stream sediment sampling program.\nThis initial work identified several targets for follow up within the Company's licence area.\nThe Company has engaged Dr. Hulbert to carry out further work on its licences in Fermanagh where he believes that multiple exploration indicators suggest a highly prospective district, comparable to\nMichigan's\nEagle Mine Nickel district model.\nThis work is ongoing and includes work on the potential of the North East of the country to add materially to a portfolio of targets in what would be a new Nickel, Copper and PGE district.\nThe company is actively seeking a strategic partner to carry out a two year exploration programme with a view to developing a number of targets in the province capable of hosting significant economic deposits.\nBrendan McMorrow\n, Chairman, Karelian commented:\n\"The year ahead promises to be an exciting one for the company with several aspects to the Company's portfolio capable of progressing rapidly.\"\nFurther Information:\nKarelian Diamond Resources PLC\nBrendan McMorrow, Chairman\nMaureen Jones Managing Director\n+353-1-479-6180\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nomad)\nNick Athanas / Nick Harriss\n+44-20-3328-5656\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Duncan Vasey\n+44-20-7469-0930\nCMC Markets (Joint Broker)\nDouglas Crippen\n+44-20-3003-8632\nLothbury Financial Services\nMichael Padley\n+44-20-3290-0707\nHall Communications\nDon Hall\n+353-1-660-9377\nhttp://www.kareliandiamondresources.com\n4102180_0.jpeg"
