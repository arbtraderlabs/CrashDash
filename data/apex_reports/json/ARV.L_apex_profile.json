          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "15 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 9282O\nArtemis Resources Limited\n15 January 2026\n15 January 2026\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK version of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nArtemis Resources Limited\n(\"Artemis\" or \"the Company\")\nCancellation of Admission to AIM\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM:ARV)\nannounces the cancellation of the admission of its ordinary shares (\"Shares\") to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAIM\n\") (the \"\nCancellation\n\") in accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). It is expected that the Cancellation will occur on 13 February 2026. The Company's primary listing is on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"\nASX\n\") and it has been admitted to trading on AIM since 7 February 2022.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFollowing the Cancellation, the Company's Shares will remain listed on the ASX, which will continue as the primary trading venue for its equity securities. The Company has no intention to delist its Shares from the ASX.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is providing an opportunity for each Depositary Interest (\"\nDI\n\") holder to become a registered shareholder on the Company's Australian share register.\nReasons for the AIM Cancellation\nThe Company is of the view that the Company's admission to trading on AIM is not delivering sufficient value to shareholders, having regard to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM, including professional fees, listing fees payable and incremental legal, auditing and other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM, in addition to its ASX listing,\n\u00b7\nconditions which have impacted stock markets generally since its admission to trading on AIM in February 2022 have made it more challenging to raise capital in the UK; and\n\u00b7\nthe relatively low levels of liquidity and trading volumes in the Company's Shares on AIM.\nThe Board considers the Cancellation will not materially nor adversely impact existing Shareholders as they will still be able to trade on the ASX.\nProcess for Cancellation\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel admission of the Shares to trading on AIM, and it is expected that the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 February 2026.\nOn the basis that the Company's Shares will continue to be listed on ASX, which is an AIM Designated Market (as defined by the AIM Rules), the Company is not required to seek shareholder approval for the Cancellation.\nThe full timetable of expected events is set out at the end of this announcement.\nPrincipal effects and risks relating to the Cancellation\n\u00b7\nThe Company's Shares will no longer be traded on AIM and the Company has no intention to implement a matched bargain facility to enable trading post Cancellation in the UK;\n\u00b7\nremaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime, including but not limited to, the AIM Rules, the corporate governance requirements for companies trading on AIM and UK MAR, will no longer apply, but the regulatory framework of the ASX, including its corporate governance requirements, and Australian company law will still apply;\n\u00b7\nshareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules, such as the requirement to be notified of certain events, including substantial transactions, financing transactions and related party transactions, and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain transactions, where applicable, such as reverse takeovers and fundamental changes in the Company's business; albeit similar protection may be afforded pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules, Australian company law and the Australian Corporations Act;\n\u00b7\nZeus Capital Limited will cease to act as nominated adviser and UK broker to the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Cancellation might have either positive or negative taxation consequences for shareholders. Stamp duty may be due on transfers of Shares and agreements to transfer Shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax advisers.\nThe above considerations are non-exhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice (including tax, financial and legal) when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nInformation for Depositary Interest (DI) holders\nThe Company's Shares will continue to be traded on AIM until market close, being 4.30 p.m. London time, on 12 February 2026 after which, there will be no public market in the UK on which the Shares can be traded. In addition to the delisting, the Company will also be terminating the Depositary Interest service. After the closure of the DI facility on 24 February 2026, all remaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register (being Automic Pty Ltd) and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX. These Shares will be held on the Australian share register in issuer sponsored form, with a holding statement despatched to each former DI holder's registered address. To trade Shares in the future on the ASX, former DI holders will need to engage a broker or a nominee capable of settling on ASX (CHESS).\nDI holders who wish to withdraw their DIs from CREST and take receipt of Shares on the Australian share register, prior to the closure of the DI facility, should contact their broker without delay.\nThe Company advises DI holders to seek independent financial and tax advice regarding the AIM Cancellation and their Shares represented by DIs.\nExpected Timetable of Principal Events\nE\nvent\nTime and/or date\nAnnouncement of proposed AIM Cancellation\n15-Jan-26\nExpected last day of dealings in the Shares on AIM\n12-Feb-26\nExpected time and date of the AIM Cancellation\n7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13\nFebruary\n202\n6\nClosure of the DI Facility\n24-Feb-26\nFurther information\nInformation on the Cancellation and termination of depositary arrangements and the options available to DI holders, including how\nto withdraw from CREST and trade on ASX\n, will be sent to depositary interest holders from Computershare. For further information on the transfer of DI holdings to ASX Shares or for queries related to sale options, please contact: Computershare Investor Services PLC on +44 (0) 370 707 4040.\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board\n.\nArtemis Resources Ltd\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director\nZeus (Nomad and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi / James Bavister\ninfo@artemisresources.com.au\nTel: + 44 20 3829 5000\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
