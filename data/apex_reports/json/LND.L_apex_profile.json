Each FT Unit and Charity FT Unit will consist of one new Ordinary Share to be issued as a \"flow-through share\" within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (each, an \"FT Share\") and one Warrant. Each Warrant shall entitle the holder to purchase one new Ordinary Share (each, a \"Warrant Share\") at a price of C$0.165 at any time on or before that date which is 2 years after the closing date of the Offering.\nThe directors and officers of the Company intend to invest, in aggregate, C$365,000 by way of participation in the Offering.\nEligible investors located in the United Kingdom who wish to participate in the Offering should contact the Company's Joint UK Broker, Novum Securities Limited, on the contact details set out below. Eligible UK investors will be those who the Company reasonably believes to be (a) persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments and as described in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the \"Financial Promotion Order\") and/or (b) high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, partnerships or trusts or their respective directors, officers or employees as described in Article 49(2) of the Financial Promotion Order and/or (c) existing members of the Company as described in Article 43(2) of the Financial Promotion Order.\nAs detailed in the Company's announcement of 6 October 2023, the Offering is being undertaken in order to facilitate Landore Resources' proposed dual listing on the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSX-V\") in Canada (the \"Dual Listing\"). It is a pre-condition of the Dual Listing,\ninter alia\n, that the Company is able to provide to the TSX-V satisfactory confirmation of certain minimum working capital and financial resources at the time of listing. Accordingly, in order to satisfy this pre-condition, the Company is seeking to undertake the Offering.\nProceeds from the proposed issue of FT Shares will be used to incur \"Canadian exploration expenses\" as defined in subsection 66.1(6) of the Income Tax Act and \"flow through mining expenditures\" as defined in subsection 127(9) of the Income Tax Act. Such proceeds will be renounced to the subscribers with an effective date not later than 31 December 2023, in the aggregate amount of not less than the total amount of gross proceeds raised from the proposed issue of the FT Shares.\nThe Company may pay to eligible persons in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulatory policies (each, a \"Finder\") a cash finder's fee of up to 6.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering placed by the Finder and also issue warrants (the \"Finder Warrants\") at an exercise price equal to C$0.11 per share (approximately \u00a30.065 per share), exercisable for a period of 24 months following the closing date of the Offering, to acquire in aggregate that number of new Ordinary Shares which is equal to 6.0% of the number of Offered Securities attributable to the Finder.\nThe new Ordinary Shares to be issued in respect of the Offered Securities will be subject to a restricted or 'lock-in' period in Canada ending four months and a day after the later of the distribution date and the date the Company becomes a reporting issuer in any province or territory of Canada. The Company will become a reporting issuer in Ontario upon listing of the Ordinary Shares on the TSX-V, which is currently expected to take place shortly after closing of the Offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for further exploration of the Company's BAM Gold Project in Northwestern Ontario and for its general working capital purposes.

The Conditional New Ordinary Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing Ordinary Shares and it is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around 9 July 2024.\nIn addition, the Company will proceed to issue, in aggregate, 10,355,720 warrants to Novum Securities Limited and SCP Resource Finance LP, in connection with their services pursuant to the Subscription. Each warrant will afford the holder the right to acquire a new Ordinary Share at an exercise price of 2.4 pence for a period of three years from the date of Admission.\nAdditional Director and Management Subscription and Conversion of Certain Director's Fees\nAs set out in the Company's announcement of 12 June 2024 and following receipt of Shareholder approval for the requisite share capital authorities at the AGM, Helen Green, non-executive director, and Michele Tuomi, CEO of Landore Resources Canada Inc., have now subscribed \u00a310,000 and \u00a35,000, respectively, for, in aggregate, 625,000 new Ordinary Shares at the Subscription Price (the \"Director and Management Subscription Shares\").\nIn addition, Glenn Featherby, Executive Director, has agreed to settle \u00a360,000 of accrued fees/salary from 1 January 2024 to 31 May 2024 by way of the issue of 2,500,000 new Ordinary Shares at the Subscription Price (the \"Director Fee Shares\") (the \"Director Fee Settlement\").\nAccordingly, application has also been made to the London Stock Exchange for Admission of the Director and Management Subscription Shares and Director Fee Shares. The Director and Management Subscription Shares and Director Fee Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the abovementioned Conditional New Ordinary Shares and the Company's existing Ordinary Shares and it is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings commence in such shares at 8.00 a.m. on or around 9 July 2024.\nOn Admission, Ms Green and Mr Featherby will consequently be interested in 1,080,974 and 7,476,053 Ordinary Shares respectively representing approximately 0.35 per cent. and 2.39 per cent. of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe participations in the Director and Management Subscription by Helen Green, a non-executive director of the Company, and Michele Tuomi, CEO of Landore Resources Canada Inc., are deemed to constitute related party transactions under the AIM Rules for Companies. Accordingly, the independent director, being Huw Salter, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Strand Hanson Limited, considers the terms of such participations to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nThe Director Fee Settlement involving Glenn Featherby, an executive director of the Company, is also deemed to constitute a related party transaction under the AIM Rules for Companies. Accordingly, the independent director, being Huw Salter, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Strand Hanson Limited, similarly considers the terms of such settlement to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nApplication for Admission and Total Voting Rights\nAs noted above, application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Conditional New Ordinary Shares,\nDirector and Management Subscription Shares and Director Fee Shares to trading on AIM.\nOn Admission of all such shares, expected to occur at 8.00 a.m. on or around 9 July 2024, the Company's issued share capital will consist of 312,816,612 Ordinary Shares with voting rights. Landore Resources does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. This figure of 312,816,612 may therefore be used by Shareholders in the Company following Admission as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nDirectorate Change\nFurther to the Company's announcement of 12 June 2024, Mr Alexander Shaw, Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of Landore Resources, has been appointed to its Board with immediate effect having previously joined the Company's senior management team on 17 June 2024.\nMr Shaw is a highly accomplished geologist with over 15 years of global experience in exploration and production.

Mr Shaw also worked for First Quantum Minerals Ltd. in a number of senior technical roles and is the non-executive chairman of Chilwa Minerals Limited (ASX: CHW) which is developing a heavy mineral sands project in Malawi.\nFurther to his participation in the Subscription, Mr Shaw will be interested in 1,041,667 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 0.33 per cent. of the Company's enlarged issued share capital at Admission.\nPursuant to him joining the Company, Mr Shaw has been issued and currently holds 1,000,000 options over Ordinary Shares exercisable at 5 pence each, and a further 1,000,000 options over Ordinary Shares exercisable at 7.5 pence each.
