Viv is also an ambassador and vocal supporter for Prostate Cancer UK and has participated in several fundraising events, including the Football to Amsterdam cycle ride and the Prostate United challenge raising funds for research and treatment.\nAbout Viv Anderson MBE:\nViv Anderson is widely acclaimed as the first black player to represent England in a senior international football match, making his debut in 1978 against Czechoslovakia. His groundbreaking appearance paved the way for future generations of black footballers in English football.

In 2004 he was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame and is recognized as a true England legend by his peers and sports fans alike.\nCurrently, Viv is a shareholder and advisor in various sports event companies where he remains active in football and the public eye, participating in after-dinner talks and sharing his experiences as a pioneering black footballer who overcame racial abuse.\nViv retired from football in the mid 1990's after a prolific footballing career amassing 594 league games which included playing for Nottingham Forest were he won the First Division title in 1978 as well as the European Cup in 1979 and 1980.\nViv also had a distinguished career playing for Arsenal, Sheffield Wednesday, Barnsley and Manchester United - where he was Sir Alex Ferguson's first signing.\nDespite retiring from playing football in 1994, Viv was still officially registered as a player and following an injury crisis at Middlesbrough he played two games for the club in the 1994-95 season, when they were promoted to the Premier League as First Division champions. After gaining promotion, Viv hung up his playing boots and remained Assistant Manager of Middlesbrough until June 2001, under his former Old Trafford teammate Bryan Robson OBE.\nNow focusing on the commercial side of business, Viv will offer GCG strategic guidance and exercise independent advice relating to any potential inaugural transaction. Leveraging from his existing professional undertakings, Viv will work alongside GCG's leadership team, align with the public company's commercial strategy, financial goals and focus on adding significant shareholder value.\nJohn Croft Director GCG Commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to have Viv join GCG, his appointment as Advisor to the Board marks a significant step forward. Viv brings a wealth of experience and exposure to the Company. We are extremely confident that Viv's executive expertise and global network will be influential as we continue to advance our search for GCG's inaugural transaction.
