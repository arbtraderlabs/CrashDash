With the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) highlighting the urgent need for secure and diversified supply chains, Altona is well-positioned to contribute to Europe's resource independence, helping secure critical materials essential for high-tech applications and the green energy transition.\n\"With strong progress on our Prefeasibility Study and a clear path to development, we look forward to engaging with European investors and OEMs who recognize the long-term value of sustainable resource projects.\n\"DGWA's expertise in the European markets will be invaluable in connecting Altona with strategic partners and investors who share our vision for responsible and high-impact critical raw material development.\"\nDGWA's CEO Stefan M\u00fcller, added:\n\"We are excited to introduce Altona to European investors at a critical time for the EU's supply sovereignty. Altona's Monte Muambe rare earths, gallium and fluorspar projects in Mozambique, along with its copper asset in Botswana, directly align with the EU's goals by developing diversified, secure, and sustainable supply chains.\nRare earths and gallium are essential for the green transition and high-technology applications, and Altona's progress-from a defined JORC resource to the Prefeasibility Study stage-demonstrates its commitment to responsible development. With Europe striving to reduce reliance on single-source supply chains, Altona presents a unique opportunity for investors as Altona is at the forefront of securing critical materials for the future. We look forward to supporting Altona's growth and connecting it with European capital markets.\"\nTo subscribe for RNS alerts, please visit:\nhttps://investors.altonare.com/\n-ends-\nAltona Rare Earths Plc\nC\u00e9dric Simonet, CEO +44 (0) 7778 866 108Louise Adrian, CFO +44 (0) 7721 492 922\nStrand Hanson (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494Christopher Raggett\nAbout DGWA GmbH\nDGWA,\u00a0the\u00a0German Institute for Asset and Equity Allocation\u00a0and Valuation\u00a0(\"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr\u00a0Wertpapieranalyse GmbH\"), is a\u00a0European Investment Banking and Corporate Advisory firm\u00a0based in\u00a0Frankfurt, Germany.

A Competent Person Report including the Scoping Study for Monte Muambe was published on 18 October 2023. The Project is now at Prefeasibility Study stage, with a focus on metallurgical testing for rare earths extraction.\nThe Company is also assessing the possibility of rapidly putting in production high-grade fluorspar veins occurring at Monte Muambe along the western margin of the rare earth bearing carbonatite intrusion.\nAltona is presently diversifying its portfolio by acquiring a limited number of critical raw material projects to complement Monte Muambe. The acquisitions of the Kabompo South copper project in Zambia and of the Sesana copper-silver project in Botswana, located just 25 km from MMG's Khoemacau Zone 5 copper-silver mine, represent the first steps towards the implementation of this expanded strategy.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
