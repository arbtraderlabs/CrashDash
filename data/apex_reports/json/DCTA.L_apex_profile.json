(\"Setcar\"), has secured a three-year contract with LIBERTY Galati, the largest integrated steel producer in Romania, to provide a solution for the treatment of oily mills scale produced in the manufacturing of steel. The waste of rolling production is a mill scale (iron oxides) which is formed on the\nrolled product; this occurs when billets, heated to almost 1000C, pass through the rolling mill and come into contact with oxygen, oil and coolant water.\nDuring the complete rolling process, about 2.5% of the metal weight of the workpiece is slagged.\nThis multi-year contract has a total value of \u20ac5.5 million, with the potential for further expansion up to a total value of \u20ac8.0 million depending on rolling mills monthly production volume. Setcar's solution offered to LIBERTY Galati further leverages the use of Directa's patented Grafysorber\u00ae technology.\nThe Group's Grafysorber\u00ae technology provides a unique method for the removal and recovery of oil compounds from the mill sludge and facilitates the recycling of a waste product that is otherwise extremely difficult to treat. Setcar's unique processing system will enable LIBERTY Galati to convert a significant quantity of oily sludge waste into a raw material that can be re-utilised in its steel production process.\nThis contract, which was awarded following a public tender process, will enable Setcar to expand further its waste treatment and disposal services for industrial pollutants and broaden the range of applications for the Group's Grafysorber\u00ae technology.\nGrafysorber\u00ae technology is a hybrid graphene-based solution for treating water sludges and emulsions containing hydrocarbons. It is at least five times more effective than current technologies, absorbing more than 100 times its own weight of oil-based pollutants. In addition, Grafysorber\u00ae is sustainably produced, non-flammable and reusable, with the adsorbed hydrocarbons recoverable.\nCommenting, Giulio Cesareo, Founder and CEO of Directa Plus, said\n:\n\"We are very proud of this achievement. This is the largest single contract signed by the Group to date equivalent to the 2020 yearly company turnover. Securing a multi-year contract with LIBERTY Galati is a very exciting win and demonstrates the building momentum for the Group's products and solutions. We are targeting a new significant application for Grafysorber\n\u00ae\nwith a very large global potential market.\nWe look forward to working with LIBERTY Galati and showcasing the compelling advantages of Grafysorber\n\u00ae\nand Setcar's solution for oily mill scale produced in steel making.\"\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.directa-plus.com/\nor contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nCenkos Securities plc\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 131 220 6939\nNeil McDonald\nAdam Rae\nSinger Capital Markets Securities Limited\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson\nPhil Davies\nAlma PR\n(Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James\ndirectaplus@almapr.co.uk\nHannah Campbell\nKinvara Verdon\nNotes to Editors\nDirecta Plus (www.directa-plus.com) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

Production enhancements to develop interlocked and blended graphene materials have broadened the portfolio, further enabling the Group to address high-growth applications including PFAS-related fields, defence and highly regulated industrial sectors. These important development come at the time when interest in the graphene market is growing exponentially as market participants look to incorporate graphene into existing products and products road maps.\nSetcar review and contract win\nManagement continues to focus on restructuring initiatives across Setcar, which has generated significant headcount reductions, operational efficiencies and margin improvements for at least \u20ac0.7m of annualised cost savings in FY25. Setcar is now better positioned to pursue opportunities within the strategically important Environmental Remediation market, underpinned by its technical expertise and extensive regulatory approvals.\nIn December 2025, Setcar won a competitive tender for a \u20ac1.5m Total Waste Management contract with Ford for a further 15 months. The company is now in the process of finalising the formal contract.\nWork to deliver further efficiencies at Setcar is progressing and the\u00a0Board will continue to evaluate the best options, improving overall capital allocation and how best to maximise shareholder value.\nSeparately, a process has commenced to realise the potential sale of non-strategic land held by Setcar, with an estimated value of at least \u20ac0.5m.\n2026 Outlook\nThe Board is laser focused on capturing high-growth graphene-based opportunities, monetising Directa's core IP, which remains protected by a substantial patent portfolio.\nThe Board continues to evaluate its options to realise value from this portfolio, including partnerships, joint ventures and licensing, and to assess its optimum options to secure the requisite funding which will be needed in FY26 to support future growth.\nThe Group closed FY25 with gross cash balances of \u20ac1.5m (FY24: \u20ac4.98m), providing a solid financial base going forward. Entering FY26, Directa has a growing pipeline of opportunities across its targeted end markets, supported by advanced customer discussions, established product performance and increasing recognition of the value to customers from adopting Directa's technology and products.\nBoard changes\nRichard Hickinbotham, Non-Executive Chairman, who would have shortly completed his nine-year tenure with the Group, has informed the Board of his intention to take up a full-time executive role and will step down from the Board on 31 January 2026. Giulio Cesareo will assume the role of Interim plc Chairman with effect from that date.\nThe CEO succession process, as previously announced, is being progressed and a further update will be provided in due course.\nGiulio Cesareo, Chief Executive Officer at Directa Plus,\nsaid:\n\"FY25 has been a year of transition for Directa. Alongside revenue growth and a significant improvement in EBITDA performance, we have strengthened our technology platform, sharpened our operational focus and taken decisive steps to improve efficiency across the Group. These actions have positioned us to better address high-growth, highly regulated markets where our graphene-based solutions have demonstrated clear added value. With a stronger balance sheet and a growing opportunity pipeline, we enter FY26 focused on execution, value creation and the disciplined monetisation of our core intellectual property and securing requisite founding that will be needed in FY26 to support our future growth.\n\"\nI would like to thank Richard Hickinbotham for his leadership over the past nine years and for the wise counsel and steadfast support he has provided throughout his tenure, particularly as we navigated a number of challenges. His contribution as Chairman has been invaluable, and we wish him every success in his new role.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nDirecta Plus plc\n+39 02 36714458\nGiulio Cesareo, CEO\nGiorgio Bonfanti, CFO\nSinger Capital Markets (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 20 7496 3069\nRick Thompson / Phil Davies\nAlma Strategic Communications (Financial PR Adviser)\n+44 20 3405 0205\nJustine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\ndirectaplus@almastrategic.com\nAbout\u00a0Directa Plus\nDirecta Plus\u00a0(\nwww.directa-plus.com\n) is one of the largest producers and suppliers of graphene-based products for use in consumer and industrial markets.

This improvement has been primarily driven by several contract renewals across the Environmental and Textiles divisions, including with Grassi, Ford Otosan, Cummins and Metchem. The Group's current order book stands at approximately \u20ac7 million for FY2025, supported further by a good pipeline of opportunities. As part of this positive momentum, Setcar announced an initial agreement with Midia International SA, worth up to $1.5 million in February 2025, to provide tank cleaning and waste disposal services for an offshore drilling campaign in the Black Sea. Group cash is approximately \u20ac4 million at the end of March 2025.\nThe Group expects to announce its audited results for FY2024 in mid-May 2025 and to report, subject to audit, an adjusted LBITDA of c. \u20ac3.6 million, in line with market expectations\u00b9, from revenues of approximately \u20ac6.7m (FY23: \u20ac10.53).\nOperational Update\nThe Board is pleased to report that it has delivered\napproximately \u20ac0.5 million of targeted annualised cost savings through the identification of\nseveral operational improvements and efficiencies across the Group, which will be reflected in FY2025. As a result of this process,\nfurther potential savings are also now being targeted.\nAs part of the new strategic focus at Setcar, following the acquisition of full majority control in FY2024, the Board has implemented a headcount reduction and appointed a new General Manager to bring improved focus and leadership. Additionally, in line with this reorganisation, there is a process for further senior appointments in place, including a new Sales Director, to strengthen Setcar's commercial capabilities and support future growth.\nAt the Lomazzo plant, management have enhanced the production team, which is currently working on a remodelling of the production line aimed at both increasing productivity and ensuring greater operational flexibility at significantly lower direct production costs. In parallel, specific investments to further improve the production line have been undertaken, including the substitution of argon gas with nitrogen as the main energy source which has already reduced production costs with additional benefits in terms of sustainability.\nThe Group has also strengthened the R&D team to better align with evolving market needs and to drive innovation both in the short term and across medium-to-long-term strategic verticals.\nOutlook\nThe Group has made a positive start to FY2025\nand continues to see new tangible opportunities in environmental remediation, textiles and in further verticals, such as asphalts, tyres, batteries and paints. It has also launched a joint R&D activity with Nant G Power to explore new battery materials, which, if successful, could lead to a broader collaboration agreement.\nGiulio Cesareo, Founder & CEO of Directa Plus, said:\n\"We are working with determination to recover the ground lost in 2024 and to bring the Group back to its expected growth path. At the same time, we are moving decisively on two key fronts. First, the significant reorganisation of Setcar, including the appointment of a new General Manager, a new Sales Director, and the addition of new executives within the Group, will allow us to capture new business opportunities and eliminate inefficiencies. Second, we are redesigning the layout of the Lomazzo plant to enhance production flexibility and achieve significant cost reductions. This lays the foundation for the Group to build momentum which is already evident from the new wins and renewals in the first quarter of FY2025, providing confidence in the success of our strategy.\"\n1.\u00a0Directa Plus understands that as at the date of this announcement, market expectations for the year ended\u00a031 December 2024\u00a0are an adjusted LBITDA of\n\u20ac\n3.4m.
