The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the\u00a0Empire Mine,\u00a0Phoenix's\u00a0holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at\u00a0Red Star, and the\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix\u00a0also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).
