This has been a transformational year for the Company, with the successful and seamless execution of our shift to a fully focused business-to-business (B2B) model. Our transition from a business-to-consumer (B2C) operator to a specialist digital marketing and lead generation company has positioned us for sustainable profitability and long-term growth.\nOur disciplined approach to cost control, strategic investments, operational efficiency and an established B2B model has resulted in a remarkable turnaround for the Company. We have delivered positive EBITDA in each month of 2024, a significant milestone in our journey. This financial success reflects the effectiveness of our new strategy and underscores the strength of our leadership team, operational model, and market positioning. I would like to thank the whole team, who have worked tirelessly to make this happen.\nFinancial Highlights\nOur much improved financial performance in 2024 reflects disciplined execution, operational efficiencies, and growth initiatives, resulting in improved profitability, a strengthened balance sheet, and sustained revenue expansion.\nSuccessful business transition\n: Successfully navigated the Group's shift to a streamlined, high-margin business focused on marketing-led customer acquisition.\n\u200b\nRevenue Growth\n: Revenue increased by 16.4% year-on-year, reaching \u20ac3.52 million (2023: \u20ac3.02 million), reflecting improved monetization of affiliate marketing partnerships and the expansion of key brands.\nNet Loss Reduction\n: The Group significantly reduced its net loss, after an impairment charge for Spinbookie of \u20ac1.4 million, to \u20ac1.7 million, a substantial improvement from \u20ac5.5 million in the prior year.\n\u200b\nEBITDA Profitability\n: The Company maintained a positive EBITDA for each month of 2024, generating a full-year EBITDA of \u20ac0.7 million, compared to an EBITDA loss of \u20ac3.3 million in 2023.\nImproved Cost Structure\n: Total administrative expenses reduced by 31.6% year-on-year, reflecting effective cost control measures and the efficiencies gained from the B2B transition.\n\u200b\nReduction of liabilities\n: The Company's working capital position improved, with current liabilities reduced from \u20ac2.3 million as at 31 December 2023 to \u20ac1.3 million as at 31 December 2024, which contributed to a decrease in year-end cash reserves to \u20ac0.36 million (31 December 2023: \u20ac0.83 million).\nOperating Highlights\nOur transformation in 2024 was driven by a series of well-executed initiatives:\nShift to B2B Model\n: We completed our progression away from direct-to-consumer gaming operations, outsourcing our online sportsbook and casino operations to a white-label solution. This move has allowed us to focus exclusively on digital marketing and affiliate services, leveraging our expertise to drive high-quality customer acquisition for our partners.\n\u200b\nExpansion of B2B Partnerships\n: We established over 200 commercial partnerships with major industry players. These relationships enhance our market presence and reinforce our ability to deliver value to key stakeholders.\nProfitable Growth from Core Operations\n: We significantly enhanced the performance of our flagship brands, Oddsen.nu and Bet90.com, solidifying our reputation as a trusted marketing partner in the gaming sector. Oddsen.nu's global expansion has opened new revenue opportunities, particularly through fixed listing fee marketing agreements generating \u20ac200,000 in additional revenue, with additional upside potential.\n\u200b\nOptimised Marketing Strategy\n: We have shifted towards more targeted campaigns and customer retention strategies, leveraging data analytics to refine engagement and reduce acquisition costs.\nCost Optimisation and Efficiency Gains\n: Our streamlined operations have significantly reduced overheads, increasing profitability without compromising growth.\nOperating Review\nThroughout 2024, B90 has successfully navigated its shift to a streamlined, high-margin business focused on marketing-led customer acquisition. This operational realignment has allowed us to leverage our expertise in digital performance marketing while reducing the myriad complexities and risks associated with operating gaming platforms directly. We have continued to invest in digital marketing infrastructure, refining data analytics and user engagement tools to optimise conversion rates for our partners.\nThe outsourcing of sportsbook and casino functions has significantly reduced operating costs, enabling us to redirect resources toward high-growth marketing initiatives. At the same time, our acquisition of Emwys AB in July 2023, a well-established affiliate company in the European market, has strengthened our capabilities and unlocked valuable cross-selling opportunities, including in German-speaking regions. Together, these moves have reinforced our EBITDA profitability and positioned us for long-term scalability.\nFinancial Review\nB90 delivered an improved financial performance in 2024, once again underscoring the success of our restructuring efforts and focus on B2B operations. Revenue increased by 16.4% year-on-year, reaching \u20ac3.52 million compared to \u20ac3.03 million in 2023, reflecting the improved monetisation of affiliate marketing partnerships and the expansion of key brands.\nThe Company maintained positive EBITDA for all 12 months of 2024, generating a full-year EBITDA of \u20ac0.7 million, a marked improvement from an EBITDA loss of \u20ac3.3 million in 2023. The Group also significantly reduced its net loss to \u20ac1.7 million (after an impairment charge of \u20ac1.4 million on the Spinbookie asset), a significant improvement from a net loss of \u20ac5.47 million in the prior year.\n2024\n2023\nNet Loss\n(1,701,414)\n(5,470,603)\nAmortisation & Depreciation\n763,932\n606,475\nImpairments\n1,398,107\n315,611\nStock option expense\n219,769\n402,384\nInterest and other finance expense\n-\n887,716\nTax\n(14,083)\n(4,462)\nEBITDA\n666,311\n(3,262,879)\nTotal administrative expenses were reduced by 49.6% year-on-year, reflecting effective cost control measures and the efficiencies gained from the B2B transition.\nOur strengthened balance sheet highlights a reduction in current liabilities from \u20ac2.28 million at as 31 December 2023 to \u20ac1.31 million as at 31 December 2024, while cash reserves stood at \u20ac0.36 million at the year end.\nThe Company's improved financial performance is a direct result of disciplined cost management, strategic partnerships, and enhanced revenue generation capabilities.\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\nAs we move through 2025, we remain committed to building on 2024's solid foundations.\nThe continued move to a B2B-focused model in the latter half of 2024 has played a crucial role in enhancing our EBITDA profitability. By fully outsourcing legacy operations to a white-label solution, we have markedly decreased operational costs and optimised resources for performance marketing. This has allowed us to drive higher efficiency while maintaining strong revenue growth.\nWith further organic growth expected in 2025, driven by our streamlined operational approach and innovative marketing strategies, customer acquisition remains a key focus. Our growing base of partnerships, including some major brands, will be key to this.\nOur ability to adapt and innovate in a competitive landscape, combined with disciplined financial management, ensures that we are well-positioned for sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.\nRonny Breivik\nExecutive Chairman\nB90 Holdings plc\nDirectors' Report\nThe Directors present the Company's report and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 202\n4\n.\nPrincipal activities and review of the business\nB90 Holdings plc is the parent company of a group focused on online marketing for operators in the iGaming industry, specialising in customer acquisition for online sports betting and online casinos games. It is using its wholly owned websites such as Oddsen.nu, Bet90 and Tippen4you to provide visitors quality content, a forum and player offers and opportunities. Furthermore, the Company is providing Pay-per-click marketing for its customers, driving traffic and new players to their platforms.\nResults and dividends\nThe Group's results for the year, after taxation, amounted to a loss of \u20ac1.7 million (202\n3\n: loss of \u20ac\n5.5\nmillion). As a result of this, the Directors are proposing not to pay a dividend for the year ended 31 December 202\n4\n(202\n3\n: nil).\nFuture developments\nFuture developments are discussed in the Strategic Report.\nFinancial Risk Management\nThe Board is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of financial risk management for the Group. The Board establishes the detailed policies such as authority levels, oversight responsibilities, risk identification and measurement and exposure limits.\nCapital risk management\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk exists where the Group might encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due. The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.\nLarge wins by customers\nInherent to the business is that there is a risk that a few players and customers might win significant amounts of money during the same period thus reducing the earnings of the Group, in particular in regard to its outsourced B2C partner which has a higher concentration of VIP players. In respect of the marketing activities for sportsbook partners, negative net commission revenues in any period could be carried forward and netted off against positive net commission revenues in future periods on which commission might otherwise be payable to the Group. Whilst the Group would not have to cover any gaming or gambling losses in the existing marketing agreements, the percentage of earnings retained by the Group might be greatly reduced as a result of this.\nGaming or gambling losses within the Group's white label operations would need to be covered by the Group as and when they occur. In the case of a large win by a customer, the Group would need to move funds from its current account to the accounts that cover the liability to customers, which would immediately negatively impact the Group's working capital and its earnings for the period.\nCurrency risk\nThe Group operates mainly in Euro's as are its customers. Some payments are in foreign currencies, like the GBP. Due to the current size of the Group, it does not actively hedge the foreign exposure on its trading cashflows. It monitors exposures to individual currencies, taking remediating actions as necessary to manage any significant risks as they arise.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group's exposure to upside interest rate risk is limited. The Company has no limited interest bearing liabilities on the statement of financial position. Therefore, the Directors do not consider the impact of possible interest rate changes based on current market conditions to be material to the net result for the year or the equity position as at 31 December 2024.\nCredit risk\nThe Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables.\nReceivables: Customers, being third party sportsbook and casino operators. The Group generates commission revenues via its affiliate marketing operations. Commissions invoiced are payable within a month after the month invoiced.\nCash and Cash equivalents: Payment service providers (PSPs). PSPs are third-party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers' virtual wallets with the Group. These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of credit card companies.\nThe Group considers that its customers used in the current businesses are of good credit quality and there is a low level of potential bad debt as at year-end\n.\nRegulatory risk\nRegulatory, legislative and fiscal regimes for betting and gaming in key markets can change, sometimes even at short notice. In most cases this applies only to the operators, not to the marketing partners. However, such changes could have an adverse effect on the Group's operations and additional costs might be incurred in order to comply with any new laws or regulations in various jurisdictions.\nThe Group closely monitors regulatory, legislative and fiscal developments in key markets allowing the Group to assess, adapt and takes the necessary action where appropriate. Management takes external advice, which incorporates risk evaluation of individual territories. Regulatory updates are provided to the Board when changes are announced.\nWhilst changing regulatory and tax regimes can offer opportunities to the Group as well as posing risks, a significant adverse change in jurisdictions in which the Group operates could have a significant impact on the Groups future profitability and cash generation.\nGoing concern\nDuring 2024, as a result of the Group's strategic turn-around, it has increased its revenues by 16.4% to \u20ac3.5 million and reported a positive EBITDA for every month during 2024, resulting in a full year EBITDA of \u20ac0.7 million.\nAs\nat 31 December 202\n4\n, the Group shows\ntotal\ncurrent liabilities of \u20ac1.3 million\n(31 December 2023: \u20ac2.3 million) and a negative working capital position of \u20ac0.2 million (31 December 2023: negative working capital position of \u20ac1.0 million). Due to the repayment overdue trade and other payables as included in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, the cash flow used in operations, after cash flow from working capital, was \u20ac0.5 million (2023: cash flow used \u20ac 4.0 million).\nWhilst\nthe Directors believe that its current strategy will show\na further increase in revenues, profitability and therefore cash flow, there is no guarantee that this will lead the Group to become cash flow positive during 2025 and thus ensure sufficient cash is available to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable future being at least the next 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements\n.\nThe nature of the Group's business means that month on month results might fluctuate. Although Q1 results were slightly below on management expectations the Directors believe the Group will meet the full year expectations. However, should revenue not be in line with management expectations, the Group will first reduce marketing spend and will save cash on overhead expenses, for example on salaries. When the results after these savings would be not be in line with these expectations going forward, the Group's ability to meet its liabilities may be impacted, in which case the Group may need to raise further funding. In the event that further funds are needed, whilst the directors are confident of being able to raise such funding if required, there is no certainty that such funding will be available and/or the terms of such funding. These conditions are necessarily considered to represent a\nmaterial\nuncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWhilst acknowledging this uncertainty, the Directors remain confident that the current strategy will allow the Group to expand its operations and generate a positive operational cash flow within a reasonable time or, if needed, be able to raise additional funding when required; therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\nSubsequent events\nNo material events occurred after the year end.\nDirector's interests\nThe following Directors held shares and share options as at 31 December 202\n4\n:\nNumber of shares held\nNumber of options\nExercise\nPrice (\u00a3)\nDate of grant\nof options\nVesting period\nof options\nRonny Breivik\n30,967,780*\n3,000,000\n0.130\n1 October 2021\n1-4 years\nRonny Breivik\n-\n3,000,000\n0.062\n18 April 2023\n1-4 years\nMarcel Noordeloos\n3,659,954\n2,100,000\n0.050\n17 March 2021\n1-4 years\nMarcel Noordeloos\n-\n3,000,000\n0.130\n1 October 2021\n1-4 years\nMarcel Noordeloos\n-\n3,000,000\n0.062\n18 April 2023\n1-4 years\nMark Rosman\n23\n,419,\n019\n3,000,000\n0.130\n1 October 2021\n1-4 years\nMartin Fleisje\n-\n750,000\n0.062\n18 April 2023\n1-4 years\nAndrew McIver\n250,000\n750,000\n0.050\n27 October 2023\n1-4 years\n*\nThis includes a\n34.65%\nownership by Ronny Breivik in\nPerformance Media Ltd, a company that owns 31,084,450 shares in the Company\nplus the shares held by Entercreation Ltd, a company that owns 8,600,000 shares in the Company, a company wholly owned by Ronny Breivik.\nAll options expire on the 5th anniversary of grant.\nDirectors who served during the year\nAppointed\nResigned\nRonny Breivik\n7 November 2022\n-\nMark Rosman\n19 March 2014\n-\nMarcel Noordeloos\n30 June 2016\n-\nMartin Fleisje\n7 November 2022\n-\nAndrew McIver\n14 August 2023\n-\nThe details of the Directors' remuneration have been included within note 5 on page\n38\nof this annual report.\nDirectors' responsibilities\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to keep reliable accounting records which allow financial statements to be prepared. In addition, the Directors have elected to prepare group financial statements in accordance with International financial reporting standards (''IFRS\")\nas adopted by the European Union\n. The financial statements are required to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\u200b\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n\u200b\nmake judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n\u200b\nstate whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n\u200b\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and prepare financial statements. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nThe Directors are also responsible for ensuring that they meet their responsibilities under the AIM Rules.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the Isle of Man governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nIn so far as each of the Directors is aware:\n\u25cf\nthere is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditors are unaware; and\n\u25cf\nthe Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.\nSignificant shareholders\nAs at the date of this report, the Company is aware of the following shareholdings of 3% or more of the Company's issued share capital:\nName\nOrdinary shares\n% of total issued share capital\nWinforton Investments Ltd\n85,520,000\n19.5%\nP.

The most significant risks identified by the Board are listed below.\nGambling laws and regulations are constantly evolving and increasing\nThe regulatory framework of online gaming is dynamic and complex. Change in the regulatory regime in a specific jurisdiction can have a material adverse effect on business volume and financial performance in that jurisdiction. A number of jurisdictions have regulated online gaming, and in several of those jurisdictions the Group's operating partner, either holds a licence or is planning to obtain one, if the market is considered commercially viable. However, in some cases, lack of clarity in the regulations, or conflicting legislative and regulatory developments, mean that the partner may risk failing to obtain an appropriate licence, having existing licences adversely affected, or being subject to other regulatory sanctions, including internet service providers blocking, blocking options to make deposits and black-listing the partner.\nThe Group is managing this risk by consulting with legal advisers in various jurisdictions where its services are marketed or which generate, or may generate, significant revenue for the Group. Furthermore, the Group obtains regular updates regarding changes in the law that may be applicable to its operations, working with local counsel to assess the impact of any changes on its operations. Furthermore, the Group's white labelled operation Spinbookie, blocks players from certain \"blocked jurisdictions\" using multiple technological methods as appropriate.\nReliance on VIP players\nA large percentage of the commission\n-\nbased revenue from the Group's marketing activities in the sportsbook and casino vertical is generated by a small group of high net worth players, described as \"VIP Players\". These are loyal players that regularly deposit high amounts on the websites. These deposit levels vary per country and are typically the top 5% of the players making regular deposits. The Group knows these players and makes them feel valued, in efforts to remain an active player. A VIP player (or also a non-VIP player) can have large winnings, in either the sportsbook or the casino, in a certain period, which can significantly impact the revenues on a monthly basis. A loss of any of the VIP Players could significantly adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results or future operations.\nIn respect of its white label sportsbook and casino brand, Spinbookie, any large wins by VIP players could potentially lead to recording a loss in such cases. The Group has Terms & Conditions in place to limit the daily win of a single player to mitigate such a risk.\nImposition of additional gaming or other indirect taxes\nRevenues earned from customers located in a particular jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes in that jurisdiction. If additional taxes are levied, this may have a material adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group. Further taxes may include value added tax (VAT) or other indirect taxes. The Group may be subject to VAT or similar taxes on transactions, which have previously been treated as exempt. The Group seeks to include geographical diversity in its operations. In order to mitigate the risks that arise, the Group actively identifies, evaluates, manages and monitors its tax risks and the geographies in which it operates. The Group works with external local tax advisers to assist them in this process.\nInformation Technology and Cyber risks\nThe Group uses third party service providers for its operations. The third\n-\nparty IT systems may be impacted by unauthorised access, cyber-attacks, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, theft or misuse of data by internal or external parties, or disrupted by increases in usage, human error, natural hazards or disasters or other events. Cyber-attack and data theft incidents may expose the Group to \"ransom\" demands and costs of repairing physical and reputational damage. Failure of third\n-\nparty IT systems, infrastructure or telecommunications may cause significant cost and disruption to the business and harm revenues. Lengthy down-time of the site (including in transitioning to activated disaster recovery servers) could also cause the Group to breach regulatory obligations.\nData protection risk\nThe Group and its third\n-\nparty service providers processes personal customer data, including sensitive data such as name, address, age, bank details and gaming / betting history. Such data could be wrongfully accessed or used by employees, customers, suppliers or third parties, or lost, disclosed or improperly processed in breach of data protection regulations. In particular, the European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") entered into force in May 2018, its equivalent in the UK (\"UK GDPR\"), having a significant effect on the Group's privacy and data protection practices, as it introduced various changes to how personal information should be collected, maintained, processed and secured. Non-compliance with the GDPR or UK GDPR may result in fines of the higher of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the Group's annual global turnover, and the Group will be particularly exposed to enforcement action in light of the amount of customer data it holds and processes. In addition, various countries in the EU have introduced domestic data protection laws incorporating the GDPR requirements. Moreover, the Group makes use of various tracking technologies (such as cookies, SDKs, JavaScript and other forms of local storage), which are subject to stricter standards of consent and transparency, both under the GDPR and the e-Privacy Directive. The Group could also be subject to private litigation and loss of customer goodwill and confidence.\nFailure of systems and controls could expose the Group to regulatory risk\nThe technological solutions that our customers, the gambling operators, have in place to block the access to services by customers located in certain jurisdictions may fail. Operators often block access to their products to players located in certain jurisdictions. There is no guarantee that the technical restrictions which the operators implement will be effective, which could place such operators in breach of the relevant laws and regulations and/or in breach of specific licences they hold, which would also have a detrimental effect on the financial position of such operators and, potentially, the Group.\nThe Group must continue to innovate in order to compete\nThe Group must offer and develop new features and perform regular system updates that will continue to attract a broad range of users in order to continue generating traffic to customers' websites. If the Group is unable to adapt its technology or its offering to consumers to ensure that it continues to generate significant volumes of traffic to customers, its revenue and profitability could be significantly reduced which would negatively impact upon the Group's financial performance. The Group uses business intelligence tools in order to track the flow of traffic to customers and analyses its quality and conversion into revenue using these tools to improve return on investment. Any inability of the Group to access these tools, for whatever reason, could have a material impact on the Group's ability to analyse its business which could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.\nSearch engine algorithm updates could result in de-ranking of websites which may have an adverse impact on the Group's operations\nThe Group relies on search engines, such as Google, which use specific algorithms that decide a website's ranking to determine the discoverability of the website and its content. At any time, Google reserves the right to update its ranking algorithms and Terms of Service. Any material update to those algorithms or any manual actions taken by search engine entities may damage the ranking of the Group's websites in search results and its presence in search-related products. This would materially disrupt traffic to one or more of the Group's websites and decrease the amount of revenue generated. Any delay in the Group making a full recovery, or if the Group was unable to fully recover following such an update/manual action, it could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group\nReliance on third party monitoring tools\nThe Group relies on hosting providers, marketing support services, communications carriers and other third parties for the day-to-day operation of its business. Any failure by one or more of these third parties may jeopardise the business and operations of the Group and may have a material adverse impact on its financial performance.\nReliance on its customers having effective internal controls\nThe online gambling industry may be vulnerable to attack by customers through fraud on the operators' websites. The Group is reliant on operators having effective internal controls to prevent fraud as it derives the majority of its revenue from fixed payments with operators (with a further element from revenue share agreements) that would be adversely impacted by such activities. Furthermore, such attempts, if not detected and stopped, could result in a loss of confidence in the customer base of such operator websites and could lead to customers leaving such operator's website in favour of a competitor, which may not be an operator with whom the Group works. The Group cannot ensure that operators' financial processes and reporting systems provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud.\nCorporate Governance Report\nAs an AIM-quoted company, B90 is required to apply a recognised corporate governance code, demonstrating how the Group complies with such corporate governance code and where it departs from it.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (\"Directors\" or \"Board\") have adopted the QCA Corporate Governance Code (the \"QCA Code\"). The Board recognises the principles of the QCA Code, which focus on the creation of medium to long-term value for shareholders, without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit in which small to medium sized companies, such as B90, have been created.\nApplication of the QCA Code\nIn the spirit of the QCA Code, it is the Board's job to ensure that the Group is managed for the long-term benefit of all shareholders and other stakeholders with effective and efficient decision-making. Corporate governance is an important part of that job, reducing risk and adding value to the Group. The Board will continue to monitor the governance framework of the Group as it grows.\nB90 is an online marketing and operating company that seeks to grow shareholder value through organic growth and acquisitions.\nThe Board aims to achieve these objectives through the adoption of best working practices and by leveraging its industry knowledge and expertise. We believe that the senior management team as well as the Board, together with their industry leading partners and networks, have the necessary capabilities to achieve organic and external growth in the future.\nIn accordance with the AIM Rules, B90 applies (and in some cases departs from) the QCA Code in the following way:\nPrinciple 1 -\nEstablish a strategy and business model which promote long-term value for shareholders\nB90 is an online performance marketing company in the iGaming sector that seeks to grow shareholder value through organic growth and acquisitions, key aspects of which are ensuring customer satisfaction on a B2B basis and strengthening the B90 owned brands (see also page\n6\n, Principal activities and review of the business).\nPrinciple 2 -\nSeek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations.\nB90 has engaged in active dialogue with shareholders through regular communication and the Company's Annual General Meeting and one-on-one discussions. New information is released via the regulatory news service (RNS) before anywhere else and the website is update\nd\naccordingly (see also page 3-\n5\n, Strategic report).\nPrinciple 3 -\nTake into account wider stakeholder and social responsibilities and their implications for long-term success\nThe Board recognises the importance of its wider stakeholders - employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, regulators and advisors - to its long-term success. The Board has established expectations that these key resources and relationships are valued and monitored. In particular, the Group's business model of outsourcing some its key activities requires reliable dialogue with contractors to ensure the successful pursuit of its long-term strategic objectives. Furthermore, the Board engages regularly with its corporate advisers to ensure proactive communication regarding the Group's activities. In doing so, the Group is able to take any feedback into account and adjust its actions accordingly to ensure it stays focused on long-term performance. The Board recognises that the Group operates within a competitive and fast changing industry and strives to remain alert to developments in a wider industry/society context.\nPrinciple 4 -\nEmbed effective risk management, considering both opportunities and threats, throughout the organisation\nB90 operates within a complex business environment and an industry that is fundamentally driven by regulatory processes. The Board has set out its understanding of the principal risks and uncertainties in this report (see page\n11)\nfor details and going concern statement on page\n7)\nand regularly reviews its strategies for minimising any adverse impact to the Group or its investors.\nThe Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group's system of internal control, which is designed to ensure adherence to the Group's policies whilst safeguarding the assets of the Group, in addition to ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the accounting records. Responsibility for implementing a system of internal financial control is delegated to the CFO.\nThe essential elements of the Group's internal financial control procedures involve:\n\u25cf\nStrategic business planning\nThe Board regularly reviews and discusses the Group's performance and strategic objectives.\n\u25cf\nPerformance review\nThe Directors monitor the Group's performance through the preparation and consideration of monthly management accounts, daily through KPIs and regular reviews of its expenditure and projections. In addition, detailed financial projections for each financial year are prepared and are subject to formal and regular review against actual trading by the Board.\nPrinciple 5 -\nMaintain the Board as a well-functioning, balanced team led by the Chairman\nThe Board comprises of\nfive\nDirectors of which two are Executive and\nthree are\nNon-Executive, reflecting a blend of different experience and backgrounds. Considering the shareholding of Mark Rosman, the Board considers, at this moment, that Martin Fleisje\nand Andrew McIver are\ncompletely independent as Directors in terms of the QCA guidelines. Accordingly, the composition of the Board does currently satisfy the QCA recommendation that there are at least two independent Non-Executive Directors on the Board.\nThe Board meets throughout the year and all major decisions are taken by the Board as a whole. The Group's day-to-day operations are managed by the Executive Directors. All Directors have access to the Group information and any Director needing independent professional advice in the furtherance of his/her duties may obtain this advice at the expense of the Group.\nThe role of the Chairman is to provide leadership of the Board and ensure its effectiveness on all aspects of its remit to maintain control of the Group. In addition, the Chairman is responsible for the implementation and practice of sound corporate governance.\nThe Executive Chairman, being actively involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company, is well-positioned to provide strong leadership and strategic direction. This facilitates agility in responding to market dynamics and executing the Company's long-term vision and objectives.\nOur Non-Executive director\ns are\nexpected to devote as much time as is necessary for the proper performance of\ntheir\nduties. Executive directors are full-time employees or services providers and expected to devote as much time as is necessary for the proper performance of their duties.\nDuring 202\n4\nthe Board held\ntwelve\n(\n12\n) formal meetings either in person or by call, all of which were attended by all Directors. The Board also passed four (4) unanimous written resolutions.\nPrinciple 6\n- Ensure that between them the directors have the necessary up to-date experience, skills and capabilities\nThe Board considers its current composition to be appropriate and suitable with the adequate and up-to-date experience, skills and capabilities to make informed decisions. Each member of the Board brings a different set of skills, expertise and experience, making the Board a diverse unit equipped with the necessary set of skills required to create maximum value for the Group.\nThe Board is fully committed to ensuring its members have the right skills. Members of the Board must be re-elected by the shareholders of the Company if they have not been re-elected at the previous two annual general meetings in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, thereby providing shareholders the ability to decide on the election of the Company's Board.\nThe biographical details of the Directors are:\nRonny Breivik (Executive Chairman)\nRonny (aged\n51\n) has worked in online gaming since 1997 and launched the first gaming portal in Norway.\u00a0In the early 2000s, Ronny was involved in a start-up, OddsAlive.com, which was subsequently sold to BetInternet in 2003.

However, given the size and nature of the Group, the Board does not consider it appropriate to have a formal performance evaluation procedure in place, as described and recommended in Principle 7 of the QCA Code. The Board will closely monitor the situation as it grows.\nPrinciple 8\n- Promote a corporate culture that is based on ethical values and behaviours\nWe are committed to acting ethically and with integrity. We expect all employees, officers, directors and other persons associated with us to conduct their day-to-day business activities in a fair, honest and ethical manner.\nFor that purpose, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (\"Code\") which applies to all our workforce personnel. Pursuant to the Code, employees, directors and other relevant stakeholders are required to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to us. These include, without limitation, laws covering anti-bribery, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, data privacy, insider trading, illegal political contributions, antitrust prohibitions, rules regarding the offering or receiving of gratuities, environmental hazards, employment discrimination or harassment, occupational health and safety, false or misleading financial information or misuse of corporate assets. The Code also includes provisions for disclosing, identifying and resolving conflicts of interest of the employees and Board members.\nThe Code includes provisions requiring all employees to report any known or suspected violation and ensures that all reports of violations of the Code will be handled sensitively and with discretion. We also recognise the benefits of a diverse workforce and are committed to providing a working environment that is free from discrimination.\nWe have also adopted a share dealing code, regulating trading and confidentiality of inside information by persons discharging managerial responsibility and persons closely associated with them (\"PDMRs\").\nWe take all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by PDMRs and any relevant employees with the terms of the dealing code.\nThe Board considers that the Company complies with the requirements set in this principle.\nPrinciple 9\n- Maintain governance structures and processes that are fit for purpose and support good decision-making by the Board\nCorporate Governance Committees\nThe Board has established two committees, of which the composition is as follows:\nAudit committee\nAndrew McIver\n(Chairman)\nM\nartin Fleisje\nRemuneration committee\nMark Rosman (Chairman)\nAndrew McIver\nThe Audit Committee\nThe Audit Committee meets at least two times during the year to review the published financial information, the effectiveness of external audit and internal financial controls including the specific matters set out below.\nThe terms of reference of the Audit Committee are to assist all the Directors in discharging their individual and collective legal responsibilities and during the meetings to ensure that:\n\u25cf\nThe Group's financial and accounting systems provide accurate and up-to-date information on its current financial position, including all significant issues and going concern;\n\u25cf\nThe integrity of the Group's financial statements and any formal announcements relating to the Group's financial performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgments contained therein are monitored;\n\u25cf\nThe Group's published financial statements represent a true and fair reflection of this position; and taken as a whole are balanced and understandable, providing the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's performance, business model and strategy;\n\u25cf\nThe external audit is conducted in an independent, objective, thorough, efficient and effective manner, through discussions with management and the external auditor; and\n\u25cf\nA recommendation is made to the Board for it to put to shareholders at a general meeting, in relation to the reappointment, appointment and removal of the external auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor.\nThe Audit Committee does not consider there is a need for an internal audit function given the size and nature of the Group.\nSignificant issues considered by the Audit Committee during the year have been the Principal Risks and Uncertainties (which are set out in this annual report) and their effect on the financial statements. The Audit Committee tracked the Principal Risks and Uncertainties through the year and kept in contact with the Group's Management, External Service Providers and Advisers and received regular updates. The Audit Committee is satisfied that there has been appropriate focus and challenge on the high-risk areas.\nS&W Partners Audit Limited\n, our external auditors, have been in office since 2013.\nThe external auditors are invited to attend the Audit Committee meeting to present their findings and this provides them with a direct line of communication to the Non-Executive Directors.\nThe Remuneration Committee\nThe terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are to:\n\u25cf\nrecommend to the Board a framework for rewarding senior management, including Executive Directors, bearing in mind the need to attract and retain individuals of the highest calibre and with the appropriate experience to make a significant contribution to the Group; and\n\u25cf\nensure that the elements of the remuneration package are competitive and help in underpinning the performance-driven culture of the Group.\nPrinciple 10\n- Communicate how the company is governed and is performing by maintaining a dialogue with shareholders and other relevant stakeholders\nThe Board is committed to maintaining good communication with its shareholders and in promoting effective dialogue regarding the Group's strategic objectives and performance.

The Audit Committee review of the external auditors confirmed the appropriateness of their reappointment and included assessment of their independence, qualification, expertise and resources, and effectiveness of their audit process.\nBoth the Board and the external auditors have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditors' objectivity and independence could be compromised. The services provided by the external auditors include the Audit-related services. In recognition of public concern over the effect of consulting services on auditors' independence, the external auditors are not invited to general consulting work which can affect their independence as external auditors.\nThe total remuneration of the external auditors for 202\n4\nand for 202\n3\nwas as listed in the table below:\n202\n4\n202\n3\nAudit services\n\u20ac1\n40\n,000\n\u20ac175,000\nThe Audit Committee remains mindful of the attitude investors have to the auditors performing non-audit services.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.\nIn our opinion:\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's affairs as at 31 December 2024 and of the group's loss for the year then ended; and\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to other entities of public interest, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nOur approach to the audit\nOf the group's 12 (2023: 18) reporting components, we subjected 6 (2023: 6) to audits for group reporting purposes where the extent of our audit work was based on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement and of the materiality of the group.\nThe components within the scope of our work covered 100% of the group's revenue, 99% of the group's loss before tax, and 100% of the group's assets.\nAll audit work relevant to this opinion has been performed by the group audit team in the UK.\nEmphasis of matter - impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\nWe draw attention to note 10 in the financial statements, which explains, for Oddsen.nu and Emwys AB (PPC) assets, the revenue growth included as part of the annual impairment review is reliant on annual revenue growth of 0% and 61.9% in year 1, and cumulative annual revenue growth of 5.9% and 11.4% for years 2-5 for Oddsen.nu and PPC assets respectively. The ultimate outcome of this matter is not certain, and the financial statements do not reflect any impairment that might be required against these assets should the revenue growth rates not be achieved. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nKey audit matters\nIn addition to the matter described in the Material uncertainty related to going concern and Emphasis of matter sections, we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters being those that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period. Key audit matters include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement, including those risks that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the\nallocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.\nIn addressing these matters, we have performed the procedures below which were designed to address the matters in the context of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. Consequently, we do not provide a separate opinion on these individual matters.\nKey audit matter\nDescription of risk\nHow the matter was addressed in the audit\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is a key performance indicator of the group. Revenue based targets may place pressure on management to distort revenue recognition. This gives rise to a risk of overstatement of revenue to assist in meeting current targets or expectations.\nRelevant disclosures in\nthe Annual Report &\nAccounts 2024:\nNote 2: Material accounting policies; and Note 4: Segment reporting\nWe reviewed the group's accounting policy for revenue recognition and assessed whether it is in line with industry practice and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.\nWe evaluated the design and implementation of relevant internal controls that the group uses to ensure the completeness, accuracy and timing of revenue recognised.\nWe performed substantive testing including:\n\u00b7\nPerforming detailed testing on a sample of revenue transactions, including agreement to third-party reports;\n\u00b7\nFor affiliate marketing revenues (including PPC revenue) where cash has been received, we agreed to bank statements and remittances;\n\u00b7\nFor white label revenue, we agreed postings per the listing to the nominal ledger, recalculated the net profit of the partner income and agreed the profit postings to invoices and bank statements.\n\u00b7\nWe corroborated the movements to the corresponding player liability accounts for January 2024, as revenue generation ceased from February 2024; and\n\u00b7\nWe reviewed the disclosures made by the directors in the financial statements.\nCarrying value of goodwill with indefinite useful lives and other intangible assets\nThe group holds goodwill\nwith an indefinite useful\nlife relating to It's a Winner Limited (Oddsen.nu) and other intangible assets on its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nSignificant judgment is needed to assess the appropriateness of the recoverable amount of these assets/CGUs to where an indicator of impairment is noted or to which the goodwill has been allocated, in particular with reference\nto forecasted cash flows,\ngrowth rates, discount\nrates and sensitivity\nassumptions.\nRelevant disclosures in\nthe Annual Report &\nAccounts 2024:\nNote 3: Judgements and\nestimates; Note 9: Goodwill and Note 10: Other intangible assets\nWe reviewed management's accounting policy for impairment and assessed whether it is in line with IAS 36.\nWe evaluated the design and implementation of relevant internal controls surrounding the review process of impairment models.\nWe performed substantive testing including:\n\u00b7\nChallenging management's assessment of the relevant CGUs with reference to the guidance set out in IAS 36;\n\u00b7\nConsidering the appropriateness and mathematical accuracy of the model used to determine the recoverable amount of the Oddsen.nu, Spinbookie and PPC assets CGUs;\n\u00b7\nConsidering historical trading performance by comparing both revenue and operating profit of the group's CGUs with projected revenues and operating profits;\n\u00b7\nAssessing and challenging the appropriateness of the assumptions concerning:\no\nRevenue growth rates; and\no\nInputs to the discount rate against latest market expectations.\n\u00b7\nChallenging and evaluating management's sensitivity analysis of the key variables included within the value in use calculations; and\n\u00b7\nIn performing and to support our procedures, we used our internal valuation specialists and third-party evidence.\nMateriality\nWe have reconsidered the appropriate levels of materiality in the year to reflect the progress the group has made in developing its business. The materiality for the financial statements for the current year was set at \u20ac280,000 (2023: \u20ac299,000). This has continued, as in the prior year, to be determined with reference to the benchmark of the group's net assets, which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for the members of the company in assessing the group's performance. In determining materiality, we made the significant judgement that net assets is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark because the business continues to develop the level of revenues that it believes can be achieved from the asset base it has acquired, which is financed primarily by equity, and the benchmark aligns with the expectations of the users of the financial statements in considering the underlying value of that asset base. This is because a material impairment of assets would be indicative of challenges in developing the revenues expected from the asset base acquired.\nFinancial statement materiality represents 3.5% (2023: 3.72%) of the group's net assets as presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. For 2024, we have now also applied a specific element materiality for revenue set at \u20ac70,000 (2023: \u20acNIL). This is based on 2% of total revenue in the year. This element materiality has been used to reflect the importance of total revenue in measuring the development of the business and because the level of revenue achieved to date underpins other key metrics used in considering, for example, impairment of intangible assets and the going concern assumption. Performance materiality for the group's financial statements was set at \u20ac196,000 (2023: \u20ac209,300), being 70% of financial statement materiality, for the purposes of assessing the risks of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. We have set performance materiality at this amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds financial statement materiality. We judged this level to be appropriate based on our understanding of the group and its consolidated financial statements, as updated by our risk assessment procedures and our expectation regarding current period misstatements, including consideration of our experience from previous audits.\nPerformance materiality in respect of revenue has been set at 70% of specific element materiality, being \u20ac49,000 (2023: \u20acNIL), for similar reasons to the above.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that as at 31 December 2024, the group had total current liabilities of \u20ac1.3m and a negative working capital position of \u20ac0.2 million. Whilst the directors believe that their current strategy will lead to a significant increase in revenues and in profitability, there is no certainty that this will be achieved and make the group's cash flow positive during 2025.\nShould trading not be in line with management's expectations going forward, the group's ability to meet its liabilities may be impacted, in which case the group may need to raise further funding. In such circumstances that further funding is needed, and whilst the directors are confident of being able to raise such funding if required, there is no certainty that such funding will be available and/or the terms of such funding. These conditions, including future trading in line with management's expectations and the group's ability to raise further funding, are necessarily considered to represent a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nNotwithstanding the above, in auditing the financial statements we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\u00b7\nWe challenged and reviewed management's sensitivity analysis in their forecasts, made up to December 2026, looking at cash generation and key assumptions such as revenue generation from major sporting events. Where appropriate we used third-party data to review and, where necessary, challenge their inputs;\n\u00b7\nWe reviewed and challenged the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts surrounding going concern;\n\u00b7\nWe compared the forecast results to those actually achieved in the 2025 financial period so far;\n\u00b7\nWe reviewed bank statements to monitor the cash position of the group post year end, and obtained an understanding of significant expected cash outflows (such as marketing expenditure) in the forthcoming 12-month period; and\n\u00b7\nWe considered the group's funding position and requirements.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Accounts, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report and Accounts. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on pages 9 and 10, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below:\nWe obtained a general understanding of the group's legal and regulatory framework through inquiry of management concerning:\n- their understanding of relevant laws and regulations;\n- the group's policies and procedures regarding compliance; and\n- how they identify, evaluate and account for litigation claims.\nWe also drew on our existing understanding of the group's industry and regulation.\nIn the context of the audit, we considered those laws and regulations:\n- which determine the form and content of the financial statements;\n- which are central to the group's ability to conduct its business; and\n- where failure to comply could result in material penalties.\nWe identified the following laws and regulations as being of significance in the context of the group:\n- IFRSs as adopted by the European Union in respect of the preparation and presentation of the financial statements.\nWe evaluated potential non-compliance with these laws and regulations by:\n- Reviewing board minutes for evidence of non-compliance; and\n- Reviewing draft statutory accounts to ensure compliance of disclosures.\nThe engagement partner led a discussion with senior members of the engagement team regarding the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur. The areas identified in this discussion were:\n- Manipulation of the financial statements, especially early recognition of revenue, via fraudulent journal entries and possible management bias in relation to the key assumptions which drive the recoverable values of the Oddsen.nu and PPC CGUs.\nThe procedures we carried out to gain evidence in the above areas included:\n- Substantive work on revenue recognition and the carrying value of goodwill with indefinite useful lives and other intangible assets (see above KAMs); and\n- Testing journal entries, focusing particularly on postings to unexpected or unusual accounts, including unexpected entries.\nA further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the parent company's members, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 5 February 2025. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the parent company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nAndrew Bond, for and on behalf of 45 Gresham Street\nS&W Partners Audit Limited\nLondon\nAuditor\nE2CV 7BG\nChartered Accountants\n6 May 2025\nCONSOLIDATED

of these financial statements\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the year ended 31 December 202\n4\nNote 1: General Information\nCompany descriptions and activities\nB90 Holdings plc (the \"Company\") and its subsidiaries (together the \"Group\") was founded in 2012 in the Isle of Man (Company number 9029V). In July 2013, the Company listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and completed a reverse merger in June 2016.\nThe Group is focused on online marketing activities for the gaming industry,\u00a0specialising\u00a0in customer acquisition for online gaming companies\n, via owned websites and Google Pay-Per-Click (\"PPC\") activities.\nBasis of preparation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith\nInternational financial reporting standards (''IFRS\")\nas adopted by the European Union\n. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the results of B90 Holdings plc (the \"Company\") and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) (collectively the \"Group\").\nGoing concern\nDuring 2024, as a result of the Group's strategic turn-around, it has increased its revenues by 16.4% to \u20ac3.5 million and reported a positive EBITDA for every month during 2024, resulting in a full year EBITDA of \u20ac0.7 million.\nAs\nat 31 December 202\n4\n, the Group shows\ntotal\ncurrent liabilities of \u20ac1.3 million\n(31 December 2023: \u20ac2.3 million) and a negative working capital position of \u20ac0.2 million (31 December 2023: negative working capital position of \u20ac1.0 million). Due to the repayment of overdue trade and other payables as included in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, the cash flow used in operations, after cash flow from working capital, was \u20ac0.5 million (2023: cash flow used \u20ac4.0 million).\nWhilst\nthe Directors believe that its current strategy will show\na further increase in revenues, profitability and therefore cash flow, there is no guarantee that this will lead the Group to become cash flow positive during 2025 and thus ensure sufficient cash is available to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable future, being at least the next 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements\n.\nThe nature of the Group's business means that month on month results might fluctuate. Although Q1 results were slightly below management's expectations, the Directors believe the Group will meet the full year expectations. However, should revenue not be in line with management's expectations, the Group will first reduce marketing spend and will save cash on overhead expenses, for example on salaries. Should the results after these savings not be in line with these expectations going forward, the Group's ability to meet its liabilities may be impacted, in which case the Group may need to raise further funding. In the event that further funds are needed, whilst the Directors are confident of being able to raise such funding if required, there is no certainty that such funding will be available and/or the terms of such funding. These conditions are necessarily considered to represent a\nmaterial\nuncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWhilst acknowledging this uncertainty, the Directors remain confident that the current strategy will allow the Group to expand its operations and generate a positive operational cash flow within a reasonable time or, if needed, be able to raise additional funding when required; therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 2: Material accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\nRevenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when the control over the services is transferred to the customer. The transaction price is the amount of the consideration that is expected to be received based on the contract terms.\nMarketing commission revenue\nIn its operations which generate marketing commissions, the Group acts as the agent. Revenue from marketing contracts with customers is recognised when players are losing their funds on the operators' platforms on which the Company is basing the amounts to be invoiced. In some cases\n,\ncustomers agree to pay a fixed fee per acquired player. All fees and commissions are invoiced on a monthly basis. The transaction price is the commission amount of the consideration that is expected to be received based on the contract terms. The performance obligation of a revenue contract is satisfied at the point a player's losses are incurred. Operators typically pay a month in arrears. This gives rise to contract assets on a short term basis.\nWhite label Sportsbook and casino revenue\nRevenue is recognised provided that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred and after adding the fees and charges applied to customer accounts, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.\nRevenue from these activities comprises:\nSportsbook\nSport online gaming revenue comprises bets placed less pay-outs to customers, adjusted for the fair value of open betting positions, adjusted for the fair value of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers.\nCasino games\nCasino, Bingo and other online gaming revenue is represented by the difference between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts won, adjusted for the fair value of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers.\nThe Company acts as the principal in sportsbook and casino operations.\nForeign currencies\nThe Group's functional and presentation currency is EURO. Transactions in foreign currency and the recognition of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 21.\nTaxation\nCurrent tax\nCurrent tax is recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12\n.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12.\nDeferred tax liabilities are provided in full. Deferred tax assets are not recorded.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nIntangible fixed assets\nAcquired intangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired separately consist of domain names and customer lists and are capitalised at cost. Those acquired as part of a business combination are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably. These intangible assets are amortised over the useful life of the assets, which is mentioned at the table below.\nThe valuation methodology used for each type of identifiable asset category is detailed below:\nAsset category\nValuation methodology\nUseful life\nCustomer relationships\nExcess earnings\n4\nyears\nBrand and domain\nnames\nRelief from royalty\n20 years\nLicenses\nCost approach\n4\nyears\nSpinbookie assets Cost approach 10\nyears\nEmwys\nassets Cost approach 10 years\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.\nGoodwill is not amortised as the Group assumes an indefinite useful life.\nBusiness combinations\nFor business combinations, the Group estimates the fair value of the consideration transferred, which can include assumptions about the future business performance of the business acquired and an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of any contingent consideration. Judgement is also applied in determining whether any future payments should be classified as contingent consideration or as remuneration for future services.\nThe Group then estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination, including any separately identifiable intangible assets. These estimates also require inputs and assumptions including future earnings, customer attrition rates and discount rates. The Group engages external experts to support the valuation process, where appropriate. IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' allows the Group to recognise provisional fair values if the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete. Judgement is applied as to whether changes should be applied at the acquisition date or as post-acquisition changes.\nThe fair value of contingent consideration recognised in business combinations is reassessed at each reporting date, using updated inputs and assumptions based on the latest financial forecasts for the relevant business. Fair value movements and the unwinding of the discounting is recognised within operating expense\n.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nImpairment of non-financial assets are accounted for in accordance with IAS 36.\nEquity\nEquity comprises the following:\n\u2022 \"Share capital\" represents amounts subscribed for shares at nominal value. Nominal value per share is nil.\n\u2022 \"Additional paid in capital\" represents amounts subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value.\n\u2022\nThe \"Reverse asset acquisition reserve\" represents the difference in carrying value between the Additional paid in capital of B90 Holdings plc and the Share capital of Sheltyco on the acquisition date (June 2016).\n\u2022 \"Retained earnings\" represents the accumulated profits and losses attributable to equity shareholders. This also includes issued and vested warrants and options.\nFinancial instruments\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows and are initially measured at the transaction price as defined in IFRS 15. The Group has applied IFRS 9's simplified approach and has calculated the ECLs based on lifetime of expected credit losses. The contracts of the Group do not contain significant financing components. Impairment losses are recognised based on lifetime expected credit losses in profit or loss.\nOther receivables are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows and accordingly are measured at initial recognition at fair value, which ordinarily equates to cost and are subsequently measured at cost less impairment due to their short term nature. A provision for impairment is established based on 12-month expected credit losses unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk when lifetime expected credit losses are recognised. The amount of any provision is recognised in profit or loss.\nCash and cash equivalents, and finance income\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months (These include Player wallets).\nTrade payables\nTrade payables, including customer balances, are recognised at fair value.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. The measurement of financial liabilities is initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance expense.\nChanges in accounting policies and disclosures\nThe following new and amended Standards and Interpretations effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2024 have been adopted. The adoption of these standards has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.\n\u00b7\nIAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, Classification of liabilities as current or non-current;\n\u00b7\nIAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, Amendments regarding the classification of debt with covenants;\n\u00b7\nIAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, Supplier finance arrangements;\n\u00b7\nIFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, Supplier finance arrangements;\n\u00b7\nIFRS 16 Leases, Amendments regarding seller-lessee subsequent measurement in a sale and leaseback transaction.\nNote 3: Judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nKey areas of judgement\nAcquisition of Emwys AB\nThe Group acquired 100% of the Emwys AB share capital in 2023. The only item held in the entity were the licenses relating to the active affiliate PPC accounts. The Group therefore consider the acquisition to have met the \"concentration test\" as set out within IFRS 3 and therefore have assessed the acquisition to not be a business combination but rather has been assessed to be the purchase of an intangible asset. As such the full value of the acquisition has been included within Intangible assets as \"PPC assets\".\nKey areas of estimation uncertainty\nImpairment of Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets\nDetermining whether goodwill and other intangible fixed assets with a definite or indefinite useful life are impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units. Goodwill was recorded following the acquisition of the operations of Oddsen.nu in September 2021. The total balance per 31 December 2024 amounts to \u20ac\n1.9\nmillion. The directors have used various estimates, revenue forecasts and expected future cash flows and the Directors believe future growth of its operations\u00a0will support the carrying value of goodwill.\u00a0If\u00a0some of the expectations are not met, impairment of the goodwill balance\u00a0may\u00a0be necessary in the future. Further details around the estimates and assumptions used are disclosed in notes 9 and 10.\nOther areas of estimation\nShare-Based Payments\nCertain employees (including Directors and senior Executives) of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions.\nThe fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model at the time of issuance. The Directors believe this is appropriate considering the effects of the vesting conditions, expected exercise period and the dividend policy of the Company.\nDue to limited trading history, the expected volatility has been based on the 5-year historical volatility of a mix of share prices from other companies in the same industry, as well as the overall market volatility.\nNote 4: Segment reporting\nIFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. In accordance with IFRS 8, the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board. The Board reviews the Group's internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Board considers that the business comprises of two activities:\n1. Online marketing and promotion of online sportsbook and casino websites;\n2. Operating sportsbook and casino brands, which has transferred to a white label solution from January 2024 onwards.\nRevenue originates from:\n202\n4\n202\n3\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nAffiliate marketing commissions\n3,208,496\n1,848,392\nOnline sportsbook and casino operations\n-\n1,176,960\nWhite labelled online sportsbook and casino\n313,338\n-\nTotal\n3,521,834\n3,025,352\nThe Board evaluates the operations based on the revenues metric. Revenues consist of invoiced commissions for the marketing and player acquisition services provided, as well as revenues generated from white labelled operations. The Group operates an integrated business model and, therefore, does not allocate general operating expenses, assets and liabilities to any of the originating segments.\nNote 5: Key management remuneration\nDirector and key management remuneration for each period was as follows:\nCash based\nsalary\nShare based payments\nTotal\nRemuneration 2024\nTotal\nRemuneration 2023\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nRonny Breivik\n229,200\n55,487\n284,687\n233,697\nMarcel Noordeloos\n198,000\n58,412\n256,412\n254,292\nMark Rosman\n50,400\n55,487\n105,887\n125,397\nMartin Fleisje\n18,000\n9,293\n27,293\n27,974\nAndrew McIver\n54,000\n13,929\n67,929\n22,523\nTotal\n549,600\n192,608\n742,208\n663,883\nNote 6: Loss for the year\nLoss before taxation is stated after charging/(crediting):\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n4\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n3\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nAmortisation of intangibles\n763,932\n606,475\nImpairment of intangible asset and goodwill\n1,398,107\n315,611\nBad debt expense\n-\n93,685\nShort term lease expense\n16,300\n22,842\nShare based payment charge\n219,769\n402,384\nForeign exchange\nlosses/(gains)\n(6,689)\n550,505\nNote 7: Taxation\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n4\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n3\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nLoss before tax\n(1,715,497)\n(5,475,065)\nProfit before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in Isle of Man of 0%\n-\n-\nAdjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods\n-\n(21,530)\nRelease of deferred tax liability relating to acquisition\n14,083\n25,992\nTax credit\n14,083\n4,462\nNote 8: Earnings per share (basic and diluted)\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n4\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n3\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nEarnings\nEarnings for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share, being net loss after tax attributable to equity shareholders\n(1,715,497)\n(5,470,603)\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of:\nBasic earnings per share\n439,782,993\n326,123,139\nDiluted earnings per share\n439,782,993\n326,123,139\nBasic loss per share (in \u20ac)\n(0.0039)\n(0.0168)\nDiluted loss per share (in \u20ac)\n(0.0039)\n(0.0168)\nThe Group has granted share options in respect of equity shares to be issued, the details of which are disclosed in Note\n17\n.

The carrying value of the brand and domain names for Oddsen.nu as per 31 December 2024 amounts to \u20ac2,009,163 (2023: \u20ac2,129,113\n)\nand has a remaining estimated lifetime of 16.\n7\n5 years.\nSpinbookie assets\nIn December 2021, the Group acquired the business of Spinbookie.com, which is presented under Spinbookie assets. This included a fully operational sportsbook and casino operation, operating using a Curacao gaming license. Since January 2024, Spinbookie operates under a white label solution of Famagousta NV, a gaming software developer platform and has various payment service providers and other operating tools implemented. Due to the changes made in January 2024 and evaluating the 2024 results of the white label setup, the Company has recorded a full impairment on the intangible assets recorded, resulting in a book value of nil.\nPPC\nassets\nIn\nJuly 2023\n, the Group acquired\nEmwys AB. The assets acquired, being the existing and active affiliate accounts used via PPC,\nare presented under\n\"PPC\nassets\n\"\n. This includes\nthe license agreement for the PPC campaigns,\na fully operational\nmarketing campaign with existing customers.\nThe assets have an expected useful life of 10 years and as at 31 December 202\n4\ntherefore have 8\n.5\nyears remaining.\nImpairment reviews\nThe Directors have performed an impairment review of intangible fixed assets and goodwill at the end of the year.\nOddsen.nu\nSpinbookie .com\nPPC assets\nConsolidated Totals\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nGoodwill\n1,913,600\n-\n-\n1,913,600\nOther intangibles\n2,\n072,350\n-\n3,090,000\n5,162,350\nOther non-current assets\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCGU Carrying value at 31 Dec\n2024\n3,985,950\n-\n3,090,000\n7,075,950\nCGU Carrying value at 31 Dec 202\n3\n4,190,150\n1,\n597\n,\n839\n3,450,000\n9,237,989\nGoodwill is not amortised.\nIn accordance with IAS 36 and the Group's stated accounting policy, an impairment test is carried out annually on the carrying amounts of intangible fixed assets and goodwill and a review for indicators of impairment is carried out for other non-current assets. Where an impairment test was carried out, the carrying value is compared to the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash-generating unit.\nThe\nrecoverable amount for Oddsen.nu\nwas assessed for impairment given the allocation of goodwill with an indefinite useful life requiring annual review. In each case, the recoverable amount was the value in use of the assets, which was determined by discounting the future cash flows of the relevant asset or cash-generating unit to their present value.\nThe carrying values of the Oddsen.nu\nand the PPC assets\nCGU's as at 31 December 2024, of\n\u20ac4.0 million\nand \u20ac3.1 million respectively,\nhas been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by the Directors. Key assumptions in performing the value in use calculation are set out below.\nKey assumptions and inputs used:\nCash flow projections have been prepared for a five-year period, following which a long-term growth rate has been assumed. Growth rates, as shown in the table below for each of\nOddsen.nu, Spinbookie\nand the PPC asset, have been developed through projections of future player acquisitions and net gaming revenue based on data obtained from partners and affiliate partners\nThe pre-tax discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is based on the Group's specific Weighted Average Cost of Capital, adjusted for tax, which is considered to be appropriate for the cash-generating units.\nPre-tax\ndiscount rate\napplied\nrevenue growth rate\nyear 1\nCumulative revenue\ngrowth rate\nyears 2-5\nLong-term\ngrowth rate\nyear 6+\nAt 31 December 202\n4\nOddsen.nu\n13.\n0\n%\n0%\n5.9\n%\n2%\nSpinbookie assets\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPPC assetsI\n13.5%\n61.9%\n11.4%\n2%\nAt 31 December 2023\nOddsen.nu\n14.\n6\n%\n38.3%\n5.8\n%\n2%\nSpinbookie assets\n18.95%\n9.8%\n21.4%\n2%\nPPC assets\n17.0%\n35.3%*\n34.9%\n2%\n*PPC assets growth rate was the 2024 expected revenues compared to the annualised 5 months of 2023.\nThe calculation of value in use for the Oddsen.nu is most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n\u25cf\nThe main assumption used is revenue growth- Based on the revenue growth assumptions above, the cumulative annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") for year 1-5 is 3.1% and a reduction in this CAGR to\n-0.4\n% would result in the recoverable amount equalling the carrying value.\n\u25cf\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital - Whereas the Directors believe the WACC rate is conservative, an increase in WACC rate to\n16.8\n% would result in the recoverable amount equalling the carrying value.\nThe calculation of value in use for the\nPPC asset\nis most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n\u25cf\nThe main assumption used is revenue growth - Based on the revenue growth assumptions above, the cumulative annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") for year 1-5 is 20% and a reduction in this CAGR to\n9.0\n% would result in the recoverable amount equalling the carrying value.\n\u25cf\nIn case the projected revenue growth is not achieved, the PPC marketing spend to drive this revenue will be lowered to save costs. Therefore, a decrease in revenue will also result in a decrease of direct costs, having a lower impact on the margins.\n\u25cf\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital - Whereas the Directors believe the WACC rate is conservative, an increase in WACC rate to\n48.1\n% would result in the recoverable amount equalling the carrying value.\nThe annual impairment review on goodwill and the intangible fixed assets showed that an impairment was needed for the Spinbookie asset. No\nfurther impairments were required for the PPC asset and Oddsen asset for\nthe year 2024. The ultimate outcome of this matter is not certain, and the financial statements do not reflect any impairment that might be required against these assets should the revenue growth rates not be achieved.\nNote\n11\n: Trade and other receivables\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n4\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n3\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nVAT receivables\n19,772\n23,133\nAccounts receivable\n358,439\n282,528\nContract assets\n318,132\n142,130\nOther receivables and prepayments\n8,031\n40,195\nTotal\n704,374\n487,986\nCredit risk arises when a failure by counter parties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial assets on hand at the reporting date. The Group has policies in place to ensure that provision of services is made to customers with an appropriate credit history and monitors on a continuous basis the ageing profile of its receivables.\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate. Due to the nature of the Group's operations the Group only has a few customers which operate with credit terms.\nImpairment\nA provision for impairment of trade receivables is established using an expected loss model. Expected loss is calculated from a provision matrix based on the expected lifetime default rates and estimates of loss on default.\nWe have recorded no\nimpairment charge\nfor the\nyear ended 31 December 202\n4 (\u20acnil for the year ended\n31 December 20\n23)\n.\nNote\n12\n: Cash and cash equivalents\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 202\n3\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nCash held in current accounts and wallets\n364,259\n829,116\nTotal\n364,259\n829,116\nIncluded within the 2023 cash and cash equivalents are balances held in relation to the matching liabilities to customers shown in Note\n18\n.

Having started his career as the owner of a traditional 'bricks and mortar' bookmaker's chain for over 15 years, he then recognised the potential of the internet for the industry in the mid-1990s. In 1998 he founded Sportingbet.com, and in 2001 floated the company on AIM. Mark stepped down from the Board of Sportingbet in 2007 before its eventual sale in 2013 with the assets being split between William Hill and GVC. In 2002, he was awarded AIM Entrepreneur of the Year.\nAfter stepping down from the board of Sportingbet, Mark has become an active, successful and widely followed investor in the digital\ngambling and\nentertainment space. His family investment portfolio now spans over\n40\ncompanies across a broad range of sectors, but still with a primary focus on gaming, support services and data driven scalable tech businesses. He is a current non-executive director of\nGaming Realms plc (AIM: GMR), the developer and licensor of mobile focused gaming content. He also sits\nas Chairman of the b\noard of Nasdaq-listed Gambling.com Group Limited (Nasdaq: GAMB),\na performance marketing company and a leading provider of digital marketing services active in the global online gambling industry.\nMark s\nerves as Chairman of the board of directors at FSB Technology (U.K.) Ltd., Double Diamond\nGaming\nLimited, and Condor Properties.\nRonny Breivik, Interim Executive Chairman of B90, commented:\n\"Mark has pioneered the development, financing, and monetising of digital Pay2Play entertainment companies over the last fifteen years and having worked with him previously at Sportingbet, I am extremely pleased that he has invested in B90 and has now agreed to become a strategic adviser to the Company. His experience, advice, market insight and knowledge; as well as his network of contacts, will be invaluable to us as we embark on the next phase of our growth.\"\nMark Blandford added:\n\"B90 is determined\nto make more use of the opportunities afforded by its listing on the AIM market, particularly as it is one of the few stock market listed online bookmakers and gaming companies on that market at present. I look forward to supporting Ronny and his team in identifying and monetizing these opportunities.\"\n-Ends-\nFor further information please contact:\nB90 Holdings plc\n+44 (0)1624 605 764\nRonny Breivik, Interim Executive Chairman\nMarcel Noordeloos, Chief Financial Officer\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson / Rob Patrick\nZeus Capital (Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nLouisa Waddell / Tim Dainton\nBelvedere (Financial PR & IR)\n+44 (0)20\n3008 6864\nJohn West / Llewellyn Angus\nAbout B90 Holdings plc\nB90 Holdings plc is a group of companies focused\non the operation of its own online Sportsbook and Casino product as well as marketing activities for other online gaming companies.\nWebsite:\nwww.b90holdings.com\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.
