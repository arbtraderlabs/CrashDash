An unfavourable decision and a punitive costs order by the ICSID Tribunal on 7 December 2016 has resulted in the Company's shares remaining in suspension continuously since 6 December 2016.\nAs the length of time to undertake and determine the outcome of the Company's Annulment Application will exceed the six month suspension time limit specified in AIM Rule 41, the Company's admission to trading on AIM will cease with effect from 7.30am on 8 June 2017.\nApplication for admission to the NEX Exchange Growth Market\nThe Company has made application for admission to the NEX Exchange Growth Market (\"NEX Exchange\"). The Company's shares will be suspended on admission to the NEX Exchange\nwhich is expected to take place at 7.30am on 8 June 2017\n. The suspension will be reviewed\nfollowing the ICSID committee's decision as to whether to grant a continued stay of enforcement of the costs order.\nApplicability of the Takeover Code\nAdmission to NEX Exchange will ensure that the Company remains subject to the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (\"the Takeover Code\") and that shareholders will therefore continue to enjoy the protections afforded by the Takeover Code.\nUpdate on Annulment Application\nOn 31 March 2017, the Company filed an application seeking the annulment of the 7 December 2016 ICSID decision and this Annulment process is now in progress.\nThe first session of the ad hoc committee's annulment proceedings is scheduled to occur on 20 June 2017. It is anticipated that the ad hoc committee will consider the Company's request for a stay of enforcement of the Award on or shortly after the first session on 20 June 2017.\nENDS\nFor further information, please contact:\nChurchill Mining plc\nNorthland Capital Partners Limited\nDavid Quinlivan\nNicholas Smith\nRussell Hardwick\nNominated adviser\nEdward Hutton/Gerry Beaney\nBroking\nJohn Howes\n+ 61 8 6380 9670\n+44 (0)20 3861 6625\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nMSCEAEKXESAXEFF"

While we are still reviewing the reasons, the Tribunal appears to have accepted that Mr Noor was deceived into signing the exploitation licenses despite his non-appearance and his witness statement having been struck from the record. Indonesia has always conceded that the EKCP exploitation licenses were validly issued and signed and it is difficult to understand how the Tribunal found otherwise on the evidence available.\"\nThe ICSID process allows Churchill to request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the following grounds:\n(i) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n(ii) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n(iii) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n(iv) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\nChurchill believes there are grounds to annul this award and is working with its lawyers Clifford Chance LLP to determine which of the above grounds may be available. As part of that application, Churchill would seek a stay of the costs orders that have been made.\nAs referred to above, Churchill has been ordered to pay a total of USD 9,446,528 in costs and arbitration tribunal fees and accordingly the suspension in trading of the Company's shares on AIM will remain in place pending clarification of the Company's financial position\nA full copy of the Tribunal decision on Indonesia's forgery dismissal application will be available on the Company's website\nwww.churchillmining.com\nand the website of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes at\nhttps://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/Pages/default.aspx\n(under cases for \"Churchill\").\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of\nEU Market Abuse\nRegulation 596/2014\n.\nENDS\nFor further information, please contact:\nChurchill Mining plc Northland Capital Partners Limited\nDavid Quinlivan\nNominated adviser\nNicholas Smith Edward Hutton/William Vandyk\nRussell Hardwick Gerry Beaney\nBroking\n+ 61 8 6380 9670 John Howes\n+44 (0)20 3861 6625\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nMSCGIBDDSSGBGLR"
