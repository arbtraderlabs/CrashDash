The options vest in three equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries from the date of grant. The options have a term of ten years from the date of grant.\nNigel Theobald, Chief Executive Officer, N4 Pharma, commented:\n\"We are delighted to welcome Alastair to the Board of N4 Pharma. His experience in having founded and grown a start-up to become one of the UK's leading life science businesses will be invaluable in supporting the commercialisation of Nuvec\u00ae and advancing our pipeline of innovative therapies.\n\"On behalf of my fellow Directors and everyone involved with N4 Pharma, I would like to thank David for all he has contributed over his years with the Company. Whilst he will be sorely missed, his work on dual loading of\nNuvec\u00ae\nand its potential for oral delivery has left us with a true point of difference and a clear path towards Phase 1 clinical trials. We wish him all the best for the future.\"\nAlastair Smith commented:\n\"I am delighted to be joining the Board of N4 Pharma. I see strong parallels between N4 Pharma and Avacta; both building a pipeline of therapies that are strongly differentiated by a proprietary platform technology and offer additional opportunities for early commercialisation through licensing.\n\"N4 Pharma's Nuvec\u00ae platform has the potential to solve a critical issue in the gene therapy market, a delivery system that can target multiple nucleic acids to specific tissues, and with the potential for oral delivery. This is hugely valuable and has the potential to make Nuvec\u00ae the delivery platform of choice for the gene therapy industry.\n\"I believe that Nuvec\u00ae will allow the Company to build a differentiated drug pipeline to drive long-term value and generate commercial progress through platform licensing deals and partnerships in the near term.\"\nThe following information is disclosed pursuant to Rule 17 and Schedule Two paragraph (g) of the AIM Rules for Companies in relation to Dr David Alastair Maclaughlin Smith, aged 58:\nCurrent Directorships/Partnerships\nPast Directorships/Partnerships (within 5 years)\nSparta BioDiscovery Limited\nAvacta Group plc\nAvacta Animal Health Ltd\nAvacta Animal Health Inc.\nAvacta Analytical Limited\nAffimer Limited\nAvacta Ltd\nAvacta Life Sciences Limited\nAvacta Life Sciences Inc.\nAvacta Group Trustee Limited\nAvacta Finance (Jersey) Limited\nAffyXell Therapeutics\nCrossco (1127) Limited\nLaunch Diagnostics Holdings Limited\nLaunch Diagnostics Ltd\nCoris BioConcept SrL\nCoris Holdings SrL\n[1]\nAvacta's lead clinical programme, AVA6000, based on the Company's proprietary tumour targeting platform pre|CISION\u2122, is a modified form of the established chemotherapy doxorubicin. pre|CISION\u2122 is designed to release the active chemotherapy only in the tumour tissue, thereby sparing healthy tissue and improving the safety and tolerability of this effective anti-cancer therapy. AVA6000 is in the late stage of Phase I clinical trials in patients with locally advanced or metastatic selected solid tumours and has been shown to dramatically reduce the severity and frequency of doxorubicin toxicities.\nFor more information please contact:\nN4 Pharma plc\nNigel Theobald, Chief Executive Officer\nLuke Cairns, Executive Director\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nVia N4 Pharma Investor Hub\nSign up at\ninvestors.n4pharma.com\nhttps://investors.n4pharma.com/link/VyEJpe\nSP Angel Corporate\nFinance LLP\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nMatthew Johnson/Caroline Rowe (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre/Abigail Wayne/Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Limited\nJoint Broker\nAndy Thacker/James Pope\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3657 0050\nNorthstar Communications Limited\nInvestor Relations\nSarah Hollins\nTel: +44 (0) 113 730 3896\nAbout N4 Pharma\nN4 Pharma is a biotech company developing Nuvec\u00ae, its proprietary gene delivery system, to enable advanced therapies for cancer and other diseases\n.\nRNA therapeutics are set to impact the treatment of a wide range of diseases and Nuvec\u00ae has several key advantages for RNA gene delivery including the ability to deliver multiple RNA therapies in a single particle, ease of manufacturing,\nprotection of the RNA payload to allow for oral delivery, no unwanted immune response and excellent stability and storage.\nN4 Pharma is building out its preclinical data set and working towards first-in-human clinical data to support significant licensing deals for its Nuvec\u00ae platform with gene therapy partners.\nN4 Pharma's lead programme, N4 101, is an oral anti-inflammatory product for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which serves as a proof-of-concept programme showcasing all the benefits of the Nuvec\u00ae platform.\nWith an estimated 10 million people globally suffering from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the IBD treatment market was worth $20.4bn in 2023 and is expected to grow by a CAGR of 3.9% to over $27.6bn by 2030, driven by both increased incidences of the disease and development of new treatments.\nFor further information on the Company visit\nwww.n4pharma.com\nor sign up at\nhttps://investors.n4pharma.com/auth/signup\n.\nNotification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them.\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\nAlastair Smith\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\nNon-Executive Director\nb)\nInitial notification /Amendment\nInitial notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName\nN4 Pharma plc\nb)\nLEI\n213800I841D2RKMFK955\n4\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument\nIdentification code\nOptions over Ordinary Shares of 0.4p each\nIdentification code (ISIN) for N4 Pharma plc ordinary shares: GB00BYW8QM32\nb)\nNature of the transaction\nIssue of options over ordinary shares of 0.4p each\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s)\nPrice(s)\nVolume(s)\n0.75p exercise price\n5,000,000\nd)\nAggregated information\n- Aggregated volume\n- Price\nn/a\ne)\nDate of the transaction\n8 January 2025\nf)\nPlace of the transaction\nOutside a trading venue\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Specifically:\n\u25cf\nBased on the encouraging data obtained on the use of Nuvec\u00ae for multiple delivery of siRNA and its oral work, the Company will commence work with the University of Queensland for the proof of concept for a product to treat irritable bowel disease (\"IBD\"). The program will seek to demonstrate through\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\nstudies that dual loaded Nuvec\u00ae in an oral capsule can reduce inflammation associated with IBD\n\u25cf\nSubject to data from the ongoing work with SRI International Inc (\"SRI\"), continue to support further development work with SRI's MGS technology whilst supporting the co-marketing of any resulting data to collaborators and commercial partners\n\u25cf\nThe increased funds will provide flexibility to further support Nanogenics in obtaining pre-IND Approval for ECP105 whilst\nin vivo\nwork concludes and it awaits the result of its application for orphan designation status for ECP105 which, if granted, would potentially give seven years exclusivity in the USA on the product post authorisation\n\u25cf\nIn addition to the core work streams outlined above, all of which are expected to provide steady newsflow for the rest of the year, work will continue in the background to identify a distribution partner to supply Nuvec\u00ae to Adeno-Associated virus (\"AAV\") vector companies\n\u25cf\nThe Board will also look to potentially add additional director(s) with proven track records or contacts in the commercialisation and/or sale of products and IP in the pharmaceutical and biotech space\nNigel Theobald, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, has added an explanatory video to the N4 Pharma investor hub which can be found here:\nhttps://investors.n4pharma.com/link/XyMJ5e\n.\nPlease submit any questions you may have and the management team will endeavour to respond as soon as possible.\nA comment from Nigel Theobald:\n\"\nWe are pleased to have raised these funds in difficult market conditions for small caps. The money will underpin our work efforts whilst we look to move through key milestones and, we believe, value inflexion points, across our three main work streams during the rest of the year. In doing so, we hope to be able to co-market our combined technologies with SRI, complete a proof of concept for an oral IBD product and achieve orphan designation and pre IND approval for Nanogenics' ECP105. All the while this work will be widening and strengthening our IP position across the Company.\n\"\nBroker Warrants\nAs part of its fee, Turner Pope Investments (TPI) Limited, will be issued with warrants (\"Broker Warrants\") to subscribe for 7,560,000 new ordinary shares exercisable at the Issue Price. The Broker Warrants have a term of 36 months from the date of admission of the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares to trading on AIM and are being issued under the Company's existing share authorities.\nApplication for Admission\nThe Fundraise has been conducted utilising the Company's existing share authorities. Application has been made for the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings will commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around 13 June 2024. Once issued, the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing ordinary shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the enlarged issued share capital of the Company will comprise 394,780,349 ordinary shares of 0.4 pence each (\"Ordinary Shares\"). The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Consequently, 394,780,349 is the figure which may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which has been incorporated into UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
