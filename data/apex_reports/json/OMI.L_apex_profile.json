Recent results are largely as expected in terms of the grade distribution across Pepas. However, PEP055 unexpectedly intersected an extremely high-grade vein at a downhole depth of only 30m, well beyond the grades that have thus far been encountered. While only narrow (1.9m downhole width), this vein could be significant, and more work will be required to understand its extent and thus its geological and MRE significance.\nThe MRE infill drill program is ahead of schedule, and subject to a mid-program review, could be completed by late October 2025. Once complete, the rig will then move back to exploration, either around Pepas, or at the APTA prospect to better understand the newly evolving geological model there. This decision will be made in coming weeks.\nA comprehensive metallurgical test program is currently being developed for Pepas, with discussions underway with several laboratories in South and North America. These plans are hoped to be finalised soon, and it is anticipated that one or two wider diameter (PQ) metallurgical holes will be required to provide the necessary weight of material for testing.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP054\n20\n40.6\n20.6\n2.01\nincluding\n33.1\n39.6\n6.5\n3.29\nPEP055\n22.05\n69.3\n47.25\n15.25**\nIncluding\n27.85\n41.8\n13.95\n45.99**\nIncluding\n29\n30.9\n1.9\n303.25**\nPEP056\n6\n28.5\n22.5\n1.64\nincluding\n22.8\n28.5\n5.7\n3.78\nPEP057\n2.95\n4.85\n1.9\n1.19\n10.85\n18.3\n7.45\n3.05\nincluding\n10.85\n12.5\n1.65\n12.31\n29.8\n46.9\n17.1\n5.47\nincluding\n32.85\n41.1\n8.25\n8.85\nincluding\n35.8\n37.8\n2\n26.55\nPEP058\n9.75\n18.65\n8.9\n0.62\n32.95\n67.8\n34.85\n3.42\nincluding\n38.9\n59\n20.1\n4.7\nPEP059\n13.4\n27.6\n14.2\n0.75\nTable 1.

Section PEP056, 057, 058, 059\nCoarse Gold - PEP055\nThe quoted composite assay result from PEP055 of 47.25m @ 15.25g/t Au has been influenced by two consecutive high-grade samples across 1.9m in which visible gold was noted in core. These two consecutive samples returned 465.71g/t Au and 122.74g/t Au respectively. Outside these two samples, grades assayed were largely in line with adjacent holes.\nThe Company feels that these two samples represent a real, and very high-grade vein, but are also cognisant that coarse gold has the potential to create a sampling bias if incorrect sample preparation has resulted in heterogenous distribution of gold throughout the sample.\nTo assess the potential impact of this, pulps from these two samples were re-assayed twice, with reasonably consistent results (table 2). The Company is therefore confident that no significant sampling bias has occurred. Geologically however, such high-grade samples are a statistical outlier and will require further understanding so that their impact on a MRE is accurately reflected.\nSample\nOriginal assay\nRe-assay 1\nRe-assay 2\nSample 1 - 1m\n465.71ppm\n453.19ppm\n478.23ppm\nSample 2 - 0.9m\n122.74ppm\n121.16ppm\n124.33ppm\nTable 2. Coarse gold re-assay\nEl Cedro - Anz\u00e1, Colombia\nThe El Cedro prospect is a large gold porphyry/epithermal system, located toward the south of the Anz\u00e1 project, on the same granted exploration title as the Pepas and APTA deposits.\nEl Cedro had been explored in cursory fashion by Anglo American, prior to Orosur taking ownership of the Project in late 2014, with additional mapping and ground geophysics then carried out by the Company's previous JV partner MMA in 2022 and 2023.\nNo drilling has ever been undertaken on the prospect.\nThe region has sparse outcrop, but a large porphyry system had been identified and roughly defined from regional mapping and more recent airborne magnetic and radiometric data. Several phases of soil geochemical surveys were carried out in the centre of the prospect, around a central core of potassic alteration visible from airborne radiometrics, and in nearby creeks where fresh rock had been exposed.\nA large area of anomalous soils was historically sampled in the centre of the prospect with numerous high grade rock chip and channel samples of between 1 and 9 g/t Au in surrounding creeks in later stage polymetallic veins (Figure 4).\nTo better define the scope and nature of El Cedro, the Company recently commenced a wider scale ridge and spur soil sampling program over the entire extent of what is thought to be the porphyry system. Being rugged terrain, sampling was limited to ridges and spurs to ensure that sampled material is residual and insitu.\nFigure 4. El Cedro prospect- previous sampling (Anglo and MMA) and sampling plan\nAfter a brief pause due to limited access during the wet season, this program has recommenced and is now approximately 65% complete.\nFigure 5. Orosur soil sampling, El Cedro - progress\nGold assay results thus far are highly encouraging with large areas of over 0.3g/t Au and at times over 1g/t Au being identified in soils and saprolite around a central core.\nGeological mapping being undertaken in conjunction with the soil program is also now better defining the porphyry system and the associated vein systems. Base metals associations have also been noted in outcrop, however, base metal assays require a different assay method not available in Colombia and these will require several weeks to be returned.\nThe Company feels the ongoing work program is showing El Cedro as a complex and highly prospective gold porphyry system. Once this current program is complete in coming weeks, all data will be compiled with a view to planning the next phase of work, which could involve drilling.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Anza Project continues to develop and broaden in scope. Pepas is progressing toward MRE as planned, but the results at El Cedro are showing this licence has much more to give\".\nColombia - ANZ\u00c1 Project\nThe Anz\u00e1 Project is now 100% owned by the Company following completion of a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), announced 28th November 2024, whereby the Company purchased all of the shares of its previous JV partner; Minera Monte Aguila (\"MMA\").\nThe Project, which is located 50km west of Medellin, is easily accessible and boasts excellent infrastructure including water, power and communications as well as a large exploration camp.\nFrom September 2018 to November 2024, the Anz\u00e1 Project was under the control of its previous JV partner MMA, itself a 50/50 venture between the world's two largest gold miners, Agnico Eagle Mines and Newmont Mining.\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within the Anz\u00e1 Project - Pepas, APTA and El Cedro. All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 5)\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nFigure 6. Main prospects, licences pre-MMA acquisition\nHoles Drilled post MMA Transaction\n48 holes have been drilled at Pepas since the MMA Transaction in November 2024.\nAssay results are tabulated below.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP012\n0\n66.75\n66.75\n5.64\nPEP013\n0\n77.30\n77.30\n7.68\nPEP014\n0\n75.1\n75.1\n5.58\nPEP015\n23.5\n63.7\n40.2\n3.75\nPEP016\n61.6\n105.3\n43.7\n3.13\nPEP017\n56.1\n96.3\n40.2\n2.06\nPEP018\n0\n54.1\n54.1\n6.01\nPEP019\n0\n44.3\n44.3\n1.63\nPEP020\n0\n54.65\n54.65\n1.94\nPEP021\n0\n107.05\n107.05\n6.22\nPEP022\n0\n76.3\n76.3\n7.24\nPEP023\n0\n15\n15\n1.7\nPEP024\n9.24\n15.6\n6.35\n1.99\nPEP025\n0\n10.1\n10.1\n1.45\n16.5\n79\n62.5\n5.4\nPEP026\n0\n14.8\n14.8\n0.57\n43.6\n72\n28.4\n2.52\nPEP027\n1\n80.15\n79.15\n2.0\nPEP028\n29.5\n60.85\n31.35\n1.61\nPEP029\n0\n30.7\n30.7\n0.31\nPEP030\n0\n77.9\n77.9\n0.32\n115.6\n122.6\n7\n0.31\nPEP031B\n28.15\n41.1\n12.95\n0.73\n74.1\n95.9\n20.8\n0.3\nPEP032\n0\n92\n92\n1.68\nPEP033\n0\n21.3\n21.3\n5.88\nPEP034\n36\n95\n59\n10.15\nPEP035\n0\n11.4\n11.4\n2.71\nPEP036B\n0\n40.45\n40.45\n0.62\nPEP037\n0\n3\n3\n0.65\nPEP038\n0\n16.8\n16.8\n0.68\nPEP039\nNo significant intersections\nPEP040\n0\n10.25\n10.25\n1.35\nPEP041\n34.35\n66.1\n31.75\n2.01\nPEP042\n104.8\n107.55\n2.75\n1.41\n116.45\n119.7\n3.25\n4.89\nPEP043\nNo significant intersections\nPEP044\n5.8\n44.3\n38.5\n6.01\nPEP045\n9.5\n71.8\n62.3\n12.76\nPEP046\n0\n53.2\n53.2\n3.36\nPEP047\n0\n104\n104\n6.61\nPEP048\n0\n32.3\n32.3\n3.65\nPEP049\n0\n94.2\n94.2\n3.74\nPEP050\n0\n34\n34\n2.33\nPEP051\n0\n7.4\n7.4\n0.43\n11.2\n72.5\n61.3\n3.36\nPEP052\n0\n4.4\n4.4\n2.24\n9.4\n81.25\n71.85\n6.13\nPEP053\n17\n27.1\n10.1\n0.9\nPEP054\n20\n40.6\n20.6\n2.01\nPEP055\n22.05\n69.3\n47.25\n15.25\nPEP056\n6\n28.5\n22.5\n1.64\nPEP057\n10.85\n18.3\n7.45\n3.05\n29.8\n46.9\n17.1\n5.47\nPEP058\n32.95\n67.8\n34.85\n3.42\nPEP059\n13.4\n27.6\n14.2\n0.75\nTable 3.

The latter of these was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas - a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA - a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in 2026, with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro - a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Project area. The Company has completed a large soil sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Drilling\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company had taken the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") as quickly as possible.\nThis infill drill program was completed late in December 2025, with results from the final three holes PEP072, PEP073 and PEP074 just received.\nAs expected, gold assay results from these three holes were exceptional, demonstrating the core of Pepas to contain very thick, high-grade zones of gold mineralisation.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP072B\n0\n47.6\n47.6\n3.43\nincluding\n16.25\n19.7\n3.45\n6.52\nPEP073\n0\n104.45\n104.45\n5.96\nincluding\n25.45\n59.6\n34.15\n10.3\nPEP074\n0\n71.35\n71.35\n6.46\nincluding\n11.4\n26.5\n15.1\n23.59\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nFigure 3. Section, PEP072\nFigure 3. Section, PEP073, PEP074\nWith the receipt of these results, the gold assay database has been closed off and handed to our resource consultants so that work on the MRE modelling process can commence.\nFeasibility\nThe Company has begun the process of assessing the economic exploitation options for Pepas in the context of the Colombian permitting regime. Discussions are currently underway with local technical consultants to map out the permitting framework, necessary environmental and social studies, and development of the required technical work plan (Programa de Trabajo y Obras - PTO), that could commence once an MRE is finalised.\nWider Exploration\nFollowing the Christmas break and retirement of the old drill rig for much needed repairs, a new rig has arrived on site to commence a regional drill program north of Pepas. This program is reconnaissance in nature, designed to better understand the wider litho-structural environment that controls the Pepas mineralisation.\nAs has been previously announced, plans for drilling programs to the south at APTA and El Cedro will be progressed once airborne geophysical surveys have been undertaken over these prospects. Options for this work are being assessed.\nGranting of mining exploration licences (\"Titles\")\nThe Company is constantly assessing its land package in Colombia in terms of geological potential, costs to hold, the ability of exploration work to be undertaken and any subsequent discovery exploited in light of local community sentiment.\nTo that end, several major adjustments were made at the end of December 2025.\nTwo of the larger, longer held applications, that made up the bulk of the original Anz\u00e1 JV project, have now been granted, and converted to exploration licences (Figure 1). The Company thus now has three large contiguous granted Titles, totalling 173km2, all within the mining friendly Anz\u00e1 municipality, an increase of some 65%.\nReconnaissance surface work has previously been undertaken on these new licences by the Company's previous JV partners. These data will now be re-assessed and exploration plans developed accordingly now that drilling is able to be undertaken.\nIn addition, several smaller applications have been dropped for various reasons, including geological prospectivity, or likely inability to able to be explored as they fall outside Anz\u00e1 municipality in less receptive areas.\nThe Company thus currently now has 154km2 under application.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Company starts 2026 in a very different position to a year ago. One deposit (hopefully) soon to enter feasibility, two rigs turning in two countries and an increasing list of high-quality targets lining up to be next.

Drilling is currently focussing on locating and defining the margins to mineralisation and on better understanding the geological controls on the high grade that is evident in the central part of the Pepas orebody.\nResults from these five holes remain consistent with expectations and continue to develop the geological model that is required as part of the Mineral Resource process.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP060\n15.25\n78.8\n63.55\n8.23\nincluding\n24.85\n62.35\n37.5\n12.99\nPEP061\n3\n6.4\n3.4\n0.48\nPEP062\n2.2\n9.25\n7.05\n0.47\n60.8\n66.1\n5.3\n0.48\nPEP063\n0\n14\n14\n2.56\n54.7\n61.7\n7\n1.21\nPEP064\n0\n18.5\n18.5\n1.28\n25.65\n75.6\n49.95\n4.29\nincluding\n44.9\n60.5\n15.6\n9.88\nTable 1.

Section, PEP064\nThe Company is currently engaging with its geological consultants in advance of formally triggering the MRE process to ensure that work on the deposit is sufficiently advanced, and that all the necessary inputs are prepared ahead of the required site visit by the resource consultants, probably at the start of November.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"Pepas continues to move inexorably forward. The NI43-101 MRE process is rigorous, but all of the pieces are falling into place\".\nColombia - ANZ\u00c1 Project\nThe Anz\u00e1 Project is now 100% owned by the Company following completion of a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), announced 28th November 2024, whereby the Company purchased all of the shares of its previous JV partner; Minera Monte Aguila (\"MMA\").\nThe Project, which is located 50km west of Medellin, is easily accessible and boasts excellent infrastructure including water, power and communications as well as a large exploration camp.\nFrom September 2018 to November 2024, the Anz\u00e1 Project was under the control of its previous JV partner MMA, itself a 50/50 venture between the world's two largest gold miners, Agnico Eagle Mines and Newmont Mining.\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within the Anz\u00e1 Project - Pepas, APTA and El Cedro. All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nFigure 3.

(TSXV: OMI; AIM: OMI) is a minerals explorer and developer currently operating in Colombia, Argentina and Nigeria.\nAbout the Anz\u00e1 Project\nAnz\u00e1 is a gold exploration project, comprising three exploration licences, and a large number of licence applications, totalling 399km2, in the prolific Mid-Cauca belt of Colombia.\nThe Anz\u00e1 Project is currently wholly owned by Orosur via its subsidiaries, Minera Anz\u00e1 S.A. and Minera Monte Aquila S.A.S.\nThe project is located 50km west of Medellin and is easily accessible by all-weather roads and boasts excellent infrastructure including water, power, communications and large exploration camp.\nQualified Persons Statement\nThe information in this news release was compiled, reviewed, verified and approved by Mr. Brad George, BSc Hons (Geology and Geophysics), MBA, Member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG), CEO of Orosur Mining Inc. and a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\nOrosur Mining Inc. staff follow standard operating and quality assurance procedures to ensure that sampling techniques and sample results meet international reporting standards.\nDrill core is split in half over widths that vary between 0.3m and 2m, depending upon the geological domain. One half is kept on site in the Minera Anz\u00e1 core storage facility, with the other sent for assay.\nIndustry standard QAQC protocols are put in place with approximately 10% of total submitted samples being blanks, repeats or Certified Reference Materials (CRMs).\nSamples for holes PEP-001 to PEP-011 were sent to the Medellin preparation facility of ALS Colombia Ltd, and then to the ISO 9001 certified ALS Chemex laboratory in Lima, Peru.\nSamples from PEP-012 onwards are sent to Medellin laboratory of Actlabs for preparation and assay.\n30 gram nominal weight samples are then subject to fire assay and AAS analysis for gold with gravimetric re-finish for overlimit assays of >5 g/t. ICP-MS Ultra-Trace level multi-element four-acid digest analyses may also undertaken for such elements as silver, copper, lead and zinc, etc.\nGold intersections are reported using a lower cut-off of 0.3g/t Au over 3m.\nIntersections are quoted as downhole thicknesses. True thicknesses are unknown.\nForward Looking Statements\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this news release constitute \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including but not limited to the \"safe harbour\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on expectations estimates and projections as of the date of this news release.\nForward-looking statements include, without limitation, the continuing focus on the Pepas prospect, the exploration plans in Colombia and the funding of those plans, and other events or conditions that may occur in the future. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in the Section \"Risks Factors\" of the Company's MD&A for the year ended May 31, 2025. The Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain adequate financing, to reach profitable levels of operations and to reach formal closure of the Creditor\u00b4s Agreement in Uruguay. These material uncertainties may cast significant doubt upon the Company's ability to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business and accordingly the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events and such forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
