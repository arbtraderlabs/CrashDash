The tender process closes on 7 June 2024 and requires the successful applicant to be fully mobilised within 6 months of the tender award. The State has already mobilised personnel at Nay\u00e9ga to ensure that the infrastructure, including water pipelines and access roads are in operational condition to ensure timeous re-establishment of operations at Nay\u00e9ga.\nThe timing of the Tender process is very advantageous with regards the manganese market which has rebounded recently from a prolonged low price environment and the Nay\u00e9ga mine, which is effectively production ready will be able to produce into this rebound in a short period of time.\nAs announced in 2023, Keras has advisory and brokerage agreements with the State where the Company will be paid\nan advisory fee of 1.5% of gross revenue generated from the Nay\u00e9ga mine for the provision of advisory services for 3 years and 6.0% of gross revenue generated from the Nay\u00e9ga mine for the provision of brokerage services for the lesser of 3.5 years or 900,000 tonnes of beneficiated manganese ore produced and sold from Nay\u00e9ga.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented,\n\"The mobilisation of key staff at Nay\u00e9ga and the issue of a request for tender for the management of the Nay\u00e9ga operation is a significant step forward in the development of this asset which the Company fully supports and is very much in line with the 2023 cooperation Agreement we have with STM and sets a clear picture of how the asset will now be developed to benefit all stakeholders including Keras. We look forward to working closely with the management team of STM.\nThe progress at Nay\u00e9ga is very positive for Keras from an additional cashflow perspective and will underpin what has been a hugely productive 6 months at the Company's flagship operation in Utah, USA where its subsidiary Falcon Isle Resources Corp, now operating from its 100% owned facility in Delta, is finalising the construction of a fully integrated granulator plant to produce\nPhosul\u00ae granules under the joint venture with partners, Phosul LLC.\nThe\nPhosul\u00ae\nproduction line will augment the already installed processing infrastructure producing sized dry rock phosphate products from the high-grade Diamond Creek phosphate mine. I look forward to updating shareholders on a continuous basis as we move forward on these two fronts.\n\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

Colton and his US team have made significant progress since joining the Company earlier this year and our high-grade phosphate products are extremely well positioned for both the organic and conventional fertiliser markets and it is time to deliver into both of those markets. The cash flow from Nay\u00e9ya will underpin the US cash flows and we look forward to being cash flow positive from a group perspective in due course.
