On publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\nNovember 6, 2023\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC (the \"Company\" or \"Pineapple Power\")\nHeads of Terms signed\nProposed Reverse Takeover of Ilios Hydrogen Canada Limited\nSuspension of Listing\nThe Company is pleased to announce that as of November 3, 2023 it has entered into a non-binding heads of terms with Ilios Hydrogen Canada Limited\n(\"Ilios\"\nor\n\"Ilios Hydrogen\"),\nbased in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares in Ilios in an all-share transaction, subject to legal, financial and other due diligence and entry into a legally binding sale and purchase agreement (the \"\nProposed Acquisition\n\"). As no binding agreement has yet been reached, the Company cannot guarantee that the Proposed Acquisition will complete.\nAbout Ilios Hydrogen\nIllios Hydrogen is a privately held, Canadian based, international developer of green hydrogen production plants with an existing portfolio of five sites being developed in Italy and other development activities in Canada, with a pipeline of additional international sites already identified for further expansion, including in the United Kingdom. Led by highly regarded industry leaders in the alternative energy sector with a strong track record, llios is an early entrant in the green hydrogen sector with a distinct advantage, having secured several valuable sites. The high ROI plants being developed will utilise proven technology that will initially produce a carbon-neutral supply of 20MW per plant in Italy, and will be modular, allowing for expansion to a maximum capacity of 100MW per site. The Company seeks to build and operate its production plants or alternatively may monetize the developed sites, producing significant near-term cash flows. As a major producer, the Company will also be well positioned to enter the emerging green hydrogen trading market, expand into distribution, and benefit from government incentives, creating additional upside.\nFurther Information can be found here -\nhttps://www.ilioshydrogen.com/\nBackground to the Proposed Acquisition\nPineapple Power was formed as a \"cash shell\" with a specific focus on acquisitions in the clean and renewable energy sectors, as outlined in its prospectus published on 21 December 2020 (the \"\nProspectus\n\"), which can be found on the Company's website -\nhttps://www.pineapple-powercorp.com/investors/\nThe Proposed Acquisition\nFollowing recent discussions, on November 3, 2023 Pineapple Power entered into non-binding heads of terms with Ilios Hydrogen for the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Ilios Hydrogen for a consideration of \u00a333 million, to be satisfied by the allotment and issue to the shareholders of Ilios new ordinary shares in Pineapple Power. It is envisaged that, in conjunction with the Proposed Acquisition, there will be an equity financing to fund future investment and working capital requirements of Ilios.\nOn completion of the Proposed Acquisition, it is the Company's intention is to seek re-admission to trading on the Standard Segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (\"\nFCA\n\") and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (together, \"\nAdmission\"\n). It is anticipated that, following completion of the Proposed Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nthe current directors of Ilios will form a majority of the board of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe sellers of Ilios will become majority shareholders of the enlarged Company.\nThe Proposed Acquisition is conditional on, amongst other things:\n\u00b7\nobtaining the necessary regulatory approvals of the FCA;\n\u00b7\nthe satisfactory completion, by each of the parties to the transaction, of legal, financial and commercial due diligence;\n\u00b7\nthe parties agreeing, signing and exchanging a legally binding share sale and purchase agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe admission of the enlarged share capital of the Company to trading on the Standard market segment of the London Stock Exchange;\n\u00b7\nthe raising of an appropriate amount of new equity funds by the Company;\n\u00b7\nthe Takeover Panel waiving any obligation the Ilios sellers (and any persons acting in concert with them) might otherwise incur under Rule 9 of the City Code by virtue the issue to them of consideration shares (the \"\nRule 9 Waiver\n\"); and\n\u00b7\nthe passing of necessary resolutions to approve the Proposed Acquisition (including the Rule 9 Waiver) by the shareholders of the Company at a duly convened general meeting (the \"\nGeneral Meeting\n\").\nIn order to effect Admission, obtain the Rule 9 Waiver and to convene the General Meeting, the Company is required to publish a prospectus, to be approved by the FCA, which will include relevant details relating to the Company, Ilios and the Proposed Acquisition, amongst other things. It is currently expected that should the Proposed Transaction proceed, the prospectus will be published, and the Proposed Acquisition will complete, during Q2 2024.\nThe Company has engaged certain advisers, and will engage other professionals, to rapidly progress the requisite due diligence and the preparation of transaction documentation including the sale and purchase agreement and the prospectus.\nAt this stage, there can be no guarantee that the Proposed Transaction will complete nor as to the final terms of the Proposed Transaction. Further announcements and updates will be made in due course.\nContinuation of Suspension of Listing\nThe Proposed Acquisition, if completed, would constitute a reverse takeover under the Listing Rules. The listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Standard segment of the FCA's Official List was suspended on 24 April 2023. As the Company is currently unable to provide full disclosure on Ilios Hydrogen under Listing Rule 5.6.15G, it has requested from the Financial Conduct Authority, and been granted, a continuation of the current suspension of listing in its shares pending either the issue of an announcement providing further details on the Proposed Acquisition, the publication of a prospectus, or an announcement that the Proposed Acquisition is not proceeding. Any restoration of the listing is subject to the approval of the Financial Conduct Authority.\nThere can be no certainty that the Proposed Acquisition will take place and it remains subject, amongst other things, to final terms being agreed.\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC is also pleased to announce the appointment of Oberon Capital as the Company's joint broker with immediate effect. Oberon Capital is a trading name of Oberon Investments Limited.\nFurther announcements and updates will be made in due course.\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\nClaudio Morandi - Director\nClive de Larrabeiti\nCorporate Finance Advisor\nclive.d.l@pineapple-powercorp.com\n+44 203 039 3913\n+44 797 317 7973\nJoint Corporate Broker\nPeterhouse Capital\nCharles Goodfellow\ncg@peterhousecap.com\nJoint Corporate Broker\nOberon Capital\nNick Lovering\nnicklovering@oberoninvestments.com\n+44 207 220 9791\n+44\n203 179 5355\nMedia Relations\nDavid Burton\nTotal Market Solutions\ndavidburton.tms@gmail.com\nThis announcement is not intended to, and does not, constitute or form part of any offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of, or vote in any manner, any securities pursuant to this announcement or otherwise.

However, the resumption of trading on the Main Market of the LSE will bring additional opportunities for the company and its shareholders as Pineapple is now one of very few available cash shells still listed on this market which enables an expeditious route to the international financial markets.\nI am pleased to report that the Company has, over the past month, received a number of enquiries from interested companies, which we are actively exploring and will update the market in due course.\n\"\nENQUIRIES\nFor further information, please visit -\nwww.pineapple-powercorp.com\n, or contact:\nPineapple Power Corporation PLC\nClive de Larrabeiti\nCorporate Finance Advisor\nclive.d.l@pineapple-powercorp.com\n+44 203 039 3913\n+44 797 317 7973\nCorporate Broker\nPeterhouse Capital\nCharles Goodfellow\ncg@peterhousecap.com\n+44 207 220 9791\nMedia Relations\nDavid Burton\nTotal Market Solutions\ndavidburton.tms@gmail.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
