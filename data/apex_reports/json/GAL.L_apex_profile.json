The Company anticipates that the closing of the Offering will occur on or about November 30, 2023 (the \"Closing Date\").\nThe net proceeds of the Offering are expected to be used for exploration and development, working capital and for general corporate purposes.\nEach Debenture will be convertible at the option of the holder thereof into common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Conversion Shares\") at a conversion price of US$0.255 per Conversion Share (the \"Conversion Price\"), being the equivalent of a conversion price of C$0.35 per Conversion Share, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the last business day immediately preceding the date that is 36 months following the Closing Date (the \"Maturity Date\"). On the Maturity Date, any outstanding principal amount of Debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be repaid by the Company in cash. In accordance with the terms of the Debentures, if at any time following the issuance of the Debentures, the closing price of the common shares of the Company on the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSXV\") equals or exceeds C$0.70 per common share for 10 consecutive trading days or more, the Company may elect to convert all but not less than all of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures into Conversion Shares at the Conversion Price, upon giving the holders of the Debentures not less than 30 calendar days advance written notice.\nInterest on the principal amount outstanding under each Debenture shall accrue during the period commencing on the Closing Date until the Maturity Date and shall be payable in cash on an annual basis on December 31st of each year (each, an \"Interest Payment Date\"); provided, however, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be December 31, 2024. Each Debenture shall bear interest at a minimum interest rate of 10% per annum (the \"Base Interest Rate\"). During each interest period (an \"Interest Period\"), being the period commencing on the Closing Date to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and thereafter the period from and including an Interest Payment Date to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or other applicable payment date, the Base Interest Rate will be adjusted based on a gold price of US$2,000 per ounce, with the Base Interest Rate being increased by 1% per annum for each US$100 in which the average gold price for such Interest Period exceeds US$2,000 per ounce, up to a maximum interest rate of 30% per annum. Any adjustment to the Base Interest Rate in respect of an Interest Period shall be calculated based on the average gold price quoted by the London Bullion Market Association, being the LBMA Gold Price PM, in respect of the first Interest Period, from the Closing Date to and including December 15, 2024, and for each subsequent Interest Period, from January 1st to and including December 15th of that year or 15 days prior to the applicable payment date.\nThe Debentures will be offered for sale by way of private placement in each of the provinces and territories of Canada pursuant to applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirements under applicable Canadian securities laws. The Debentures may also be offered for sale in the United States pursuant to available exemptions from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in those other jurisdictions outside of Canada and the United States provided that no prospectus filing or comparable obligation arises in such other jurisdiction.\nIn connection with the Offering, certain finders may receive from the Company: (i) a cash finder's fee payment equal to 5.0% of the gross proceeds raised under the Offering from subscribers introduced to the Company by such finder; and (ii) such number of non-transferable finder's warrants (\"Finder Warrants\") as is equal to 5.0% of the maximum number of Conversion Shares issuable under the Debentures sold under the Offering to subscribers introduced to the Company by such finder. Each Finder Warrant will be exercisable to acquire one common share in the capital of the Company at the Conversion Price at any time on or before that date which is 36 months following the Closing Date.\nThe Offering remains subject to the acceptance of the TSXV.\nThe securities issued pursuant to the Offering will be subject to a four-month hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws.\nThe securities offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities law, and may not be offered or sold\nin the United States absent registration or an exemption from such registration requirements. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nAbout Galantas Gold Corporation\nGalantas Gold Corporation is a Canadian public company that trades on the TSXV and the London Stock Exchange AIM market, both under the symbol GAL.

Ocean Partners will exchange approximately US$14 million (GBP \u00a310.3 million) in existing loans for an 80% interest in Flintridge Resources Limited (\"Flintridge\") and an 80% interest in Omagh Minerals Ltd (\"Omagh Minerals\"), subsidiaries of Galantas which together own the Omagh Project (the \"Proposed Transaction\"). The remaining 20% interest in Flintridge and 20% interest in Omagh Minerals will be retained by Galantas.\nFollowing the Proposed Transaction, Ocean Partners will have the option to convert the approximately US$1 million (GBP \u00a3738,481) of remaining debt into a 0.001% interest in Flintridge at any time after mining has restarted on the Omagh Project.\nOcean Partners will invest an initial US$3 million (GBP \u00a32.2 million) in the Omagh Project\nfor exploration, a restart plan and general and administrative costs for a period of up to one year (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, Ocean Partners will have the option to invest an additional US$5 million (GBP \u00a33.7 million) for exploration and commissioning a development program for a period of up to one year (the \"Second Term\"). Galantas will be free carried on the initial US$3 million\n(GBP \u00a32.2 million)\ninvestment and will have the option to invest its pro-rata share on future investments, including the Second Term.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"We are very pleased to enter into the Proposed Transaction with Ocean Partners, a long-standing stakeholder who recognizes the district-scale and high-grade potential of the Omagh Project. The Proposed Transaction represents a turning point in the Omagh Project's development, enabling Galantas to benefit from a recommencement in production amid rising gold prices, while also strengthening the Company's balance sheet. The Company will have the benefit of receiving gold ounces once the Omagh Project is restarted, while also advancing the Gairloch high-grade gold and copper VMS project in Scotland. Upon closing of the Proposed Transaction, the joint venture intends to commence a drill program targeting the high-grade zones at the Omagh Project's Joshua Vein and test the northern extension of the Kearney Vein.\"\nRule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies - Fundamental change of business\nThe Proposed Transaction constitutes a fundamental change in business under\nRule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies\nby virtue of the size of the disposition and is\nsubject to shareholder approval at a meeting or by a written shareholders' resolution signed by at least 50% of the shareholders of the issuer.\nNotwithstanding the Company proposes to divest substantially all of its trading business and assets, the Company will continue to be admitted to trading on AIM and will not be classified as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell. If the Proposed Transaction is concluded, Galantas will focus on\ninitiating an inaugural mineral resource estimate at the Gairloch Project in Scotland and also commence an exploration drilling program at Gairloch.\nUpon closing of the Proposed Transaction, Ocean Partners and Galantas will sign a shareholders agreement (the \"Joint Venture\") focused on exploration and restart plans with Ocean Partners as project operator.\nThe board of directors of Flintridge shall be comprised of four representatives of Ocean Partners and one representative of the Company for so long as the Company owns at least a 10% interest in Flintridge. There will be no change to the board of directors of the Company following the\nProposed Transaction\n. Flintridge will have a fixed valuation of US$15 million (GBP \u00a311.1 million) for future cash calls.\nDuring the Initial Term, Galantas shall have the option (the \"Galantas Option\") to convert its 20% ownership interest in Flintridge into a 3.00% net smelter return royalty (the \"3% NSR\"). 50% of the 3% NSR shall be subject to a buy-back provision for US$8 million (GBP \u00a35.9 million) by Flintridge. In the event that: (i) Galantas does not exercise the Galantas Option during the Initial Term; and (ii) Galantas is diluted to below 10% ownership in Flintridge, the entirety of Galantas' ownership shall automatically convert to a 1.5% net smelter return royalty (the \"1.5% NSR\"). The remaining 50% of the 1.5% NSR shall be subject to a buy-back provision for US$4 million (GBP \u00a33.0 million) by Flintridge.\nGalantas has entered into an exclusivity period with Ocean Partners regarding the Proposed Transaction, including without limitation, the settling of the form of Definitive Agreements, until the earlier of (i) the date of the execution of a mutually acceptable Definitive Agreements, (ii) the date upon which Ocean Partners and Galantas mutually agree in writing to terminate discussions, or (iii) June 30, 2025, unless extended by mutual agreement by Ocean Partners and Galantas.\nThe Proposed Transaction remains subject to conditions precedent, including Ocean Partners board approval and completion of due diligence by Ocean Partners, the completion of definitive documentation and the receipt of all required approvals and consents, including shareholder approval by Galantas shareholders as well as formal filings with and approval from the TSX Venture Exchange.\nOcean Partners is a person closely associated with Brent Omland, a Director of Galantas (within the meaning of the EU Market Abuse Regulation). Mr. Omland is Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Partners and is a nominee of Ocean Partners on the board of Galantas and holds a minority stake in, and is a director of, Ocean Partners' parent entity.\nAIM Rule 13\n-\nRelated-party transaction\nMel\nquart Limited (\"Melquart\"), a shareholder with 24.5% ownership, indicated that, subject to approval by the Company's shareholders, it intends to convert US$875,000 (GBP \u00a3646,171) of its debt held as a convertible note plus accrued interest of US$182,803 (GBP \u00a3134,997) into 17,630,050 common shares of no par value (\"Common Shares\") in Galantas at a deemed price of US$0.06 (GBP \u00a30.044) per share (the \"Discounted Price\") (the \"Melquart Debt Transaction\").\nMelquart is deemed a related party to the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies. The Melquart Debt Transaction is considered a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13\nof the AIM Rules for Companies\n. Accordingly, the directors of the Company, who are all considered independent of the Melquart Debt Transaction, having consulted with their Nominated Adviser, consider that the terms of the Melquart Debt Transaction to be fair and reasonable in so far as the Company's shareholders (\"Shareholders\") are concerned.\nFollowing the Melquart Debt Transaction, Melquart will hold 47,372,977 Common Shares equal to approximately 35.4% of the Company's issued share capital.\nMultilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders\nThe Company is\nexempt from the requirements of MI 61-101 to obtain a formal valuation and minority shareholder approval in connection with the Proposed Transaction with Ocean Partners in reliance on section 5.5(g) of MI 61-101.

          "content": "7 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 9051N\nGalantas Gold Corporation\n07 January 2026\nGALANTAS GOLD ANNOUNCES DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE THE ANDACOLLO ORO GOLD PROJECT, CHILE\nToronto, Ontario - January 6, 2026 - Galantas Gold Corporation\n(TSX-V: GAL | AIM: GAL) (\"\nGalantas\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") is pleased to announce that on January 6, 2026 it has entered into a\u00a0share purchase agreement\u00a0(the \"\nAgreement\n\") to acquire a\u00a0100% ownership interest in the Andacollo Oro Gold Project\u00a0(the \"\nProject\n\"), located in the Coquimbo Region of central Chile (the \"\nTransaction\n\"). The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. The acquisition represents a significant strategic step for Galantas and is expected to constitute a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition\u00a0under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\").\nAndacollo Oro Gold Project Overview\nThe Project is located in the Coquimbo Region, Chile, approximately 55 kilometres southeast of the coastal city of La Serena, at a low elevation of 1,100 metres. The Project includes a\nsubstantial permitted footprint with\u00a0mining concessions, land title, and water rights\u00a0in place. Extensive earthworks, mine infrastructure, and three leach pads remain on site with excellent access to infrastructure, services, and a skilled workforce.\nA\nhistorical mineral resource estimate(1)(2) for the Project estimates its measured and indicated mineral resources at an aggregate of 2.02 million (M) ounces (oz) of gold (Au), consisting of 130M tonnes (t) at 0.48 Au grams per tonne\n(g/t) and estimates its inferred mineral resources at\n5.06M oz Au, consisting of 358Mt at 0.45 Au g/t\n.\nThe historical mineral resource estimate\u00a0is derived from the\u00a0National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\") technical report titled \"\nCMID SPA, Andacollo Oro, Chile, Technical Report\"\nprepared by GEOINVEST SAC E.I.R.L. Chile, with an effective date of August 23, 2021 (the \"\nHistorical Report\n\").\nThe Historical Report states that the Project operated as a\u00a020,000 tonne per day (tpd) open pit heap leach operation, producing a cumulative\u00a01.12M oz Au between 1998 and 2018, with peak annual production of approximately\u00a0135,000 oz Au.\nGeologically, the Project hosts a\u00a0low-sulphidation epithermal, manto-style gold system. The deposit has been extensively evaluated by past operators, with\u00a01,600 drill holes completed for a total of approximately 190,000 metres, providing a robust technical database underpinning multiple historical studies and resource estimates.\nThe Project is adjacent to the producing Carmen del Andacollo porphyry copper mine (the \"\nCDA Mine\n\"), operated by Teck Resources Limited (\"\nTeck\n\"), which produces about 45,000 tonnes of copper per year. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nMario Stifano, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:\n\"This transaction represents a clear step-change in the scale and profile of Galantas. The acquisition of the Andacollo Oro Gold Project fundamentally repositions the Company, adding a large-scale, past-producing gold asset with existing infrastructure, permits, and a deep technical database in one of Chile's most established mining districts.\nWith an Adsorption-Desorption-Recovery plant at 200,000 oz per annum nameplate capacity, the Project provides Galantas with multiple development pathways and a level of optionality that is rarely available in a single transaction, while the staged consideration structure reflects our commitment to capital discipline and risk management. The Project has significant exploration potential for both additional gold and copper mineralization.\nImportantly, this acquisition complements our ongoing work at the Indiana Gold-Copper Project, where a Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway and drilling is planned for the first quarter of 2026. Together, these assets mark an evolution of Galantas from a single-asset company into a multi-asset platform, positioning the Company for disciplined growth and long-term value creation.\"\nTransaction Structure and Related-Party Disclosure\nThe Transaction will be effected by way of the Agreement, pursuant to which Galantas will acquire\u00a0100% of the shares of Sol de Oro Mining Ltd. (\"\nSol\n\"), which in turn owns\u00a0100% of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera OXI SpA (\"\nOXI\n\"). OXI has purchased 100% of the shares of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera e Inmobiliaria Dragones SpA (\"\nDragones\n\"), the owner of the Project, pursuant to certain share purchase agreements dated January 6, 2026 with the former Dragones shareholders (the \"\nDragones Agreements\n\"). All former Dragones shareholders are arm's length to OXI, Sol and Galantas. If the payments described below are not completed to the former Dragones shareholders, such shares will be transferred back to the former shareholders with any partial payments forfeited. Sol and OXI were established as dedicated transaction vehicles to consolidate ownership and facilitate the acquisition of the Project.\nA summary of Sol's financial information on a consolidated basis (which includes both OXI and Dragones) as at and for the year ended December 31, 2025, is as follows:\nTotal (US$)\nTotal (GBP)\nTotal Assets\n4,275,908\n3,168,918\nTotal Liabilities\n4,343,429\n3,218,958\nRevenue\n-\n-\nProfit / (Losses)\n(67,521)\n(50,040)\nSol is owned 100% by Robert Sedgemore, who is an executive officer of Galantas and is a Non-Arm's Length Party as defined in the TSXV policies in relation to Galantas. As a result, the Transaction constitutes a\u00a0\"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101\nProtection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions\n(\"\nMI 61-101\n\") and TSXV policies. The terms of the Transaction were negotiated on a commercial basis. In considering the Transaction, the board of directors of Galantas reviewed the Project's historical production performance, technical information, jurisdictional profile, and comparable transaction metrics, and determined that the Transaction is\u00a0in the best interests of the Company. The Company relied on exemptions from the formal valuation of MI 61-101 as no securities of the Company are listed or quoted on certain specified exchanges. The Transaction has received\u00a0full board approval\u00a0and will be subject to all required regulatory approvals, including minority approval requirements of MI 61-101. No finder fees were paid in relation to the Transaction.\nRobert Sedgemore is deemed a related party to the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies, and the Sol Payment (as defined below) is considered a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Accordingly, the directors of the Company, who are all considered independent of the Sol Payment, having consulted with their Nominated Adviser, consider the terms of the Sol Payment to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nConsideration and Payment Terms\nSubject to TSXV approval, the total\u00a0cash consideration\u00a0payable under the Agreement and the Dragones Agreements is\u00a0US$32.0 million, structured as staged payments over four years to align with development planning and capital discipline.\nThe cash consideration is payable as follows:\n\u00b7\nOn closing of the Transaction (the \"\nClosing\n\"):\u00a0US$4.5 million, comprised of:\no\nthe assumption of debts held by OXI and Sol, which is approximately US$3.0 million; and\no\nUS$1.5 million payable to the Sol shareholder, Robert Sedgemore, as consideration for 100% of the shares of Sol (the \"\nSol Payment\n\").\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2026:\u00a0US$3.5 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2027:\u00a0US$4.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2028:\u00a0US$6.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2029:\u00a0US$14.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\nIn addition to the cash consideration, on Closing,\u00a0Luis Catril, the controlling shareholder of Dragones, will receive\u00a091,313,890 common shares of Galantas (representing 19.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Galantas as of January 6, 2026), subject to TSXV approval and Galantas shareholder approval, excluding Robert Sedgemore as a connected party to the Transaction.\nThe common shares to be issued to Mr. Catril will be issued at a\u00a0deemed price equal to the market price of the Company's shares in accordance with TSXV policies\u00a0and are expected to be subject to\u00a0applicable resale restrictions and escrow requirements, if any, as determined by the TSXV.\nThe Company expects to fund the cash consideration from a combination of future financing and/or working capital.\nK2 Resources Inc. (\"\nK2\n\") and ExGen Resources Inc. (\"\nExGen\n\") hold silver streams on the Property, each requiring delivery of 33.4% and 66.6%, respectively, of each payable ounce of silver produced at the Property to K2 and ExGen until the payment of 333,334 ounces of silver to K2 and 666,667 of silver to ExGen is complete, and after which 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively, of each ounce of payable silver produced at the Property will be delivered to each of K2 and ExGen.\nFurther information on the Project\nThe Project represents a rare opportunity to acquire a\u00a0large-scale, brownfield gold asset\u00a0with a long operating history,\u00a0existing infrastructure, and a\u00a0fully permitted footprint\u00a0in a stable and well-established mining jurisdiction. Unlike greenfield projects, the Project benefits from historical mine development, processing facilities, and infrastructure already in place, materially reducing development complexity and capital costs.\nThe Project is a\u00a0past-producing open pit heap leach operation with proven metallurgy, having historically operated at commercial scale for more than two decades. The Project has been non-operational since 2015. Mining methods, metallurgical performance, and processing routes are well understood based on extensive historical operating data, significantly reducing technical uncertainty relative to earlier-stage assets.\nThe Project hosts a historical mineral resource base, supported by a large drilling database and multiple historical technical studies. In addition, significant mineralized material remains on site, including material placed on existing leach pads, providing a tangible foundation for staged evaluation and development activities.\nFrom a development perspective, the combination of\u00a0existing infrastructure, valid permits, historical production, historical mineral resource estimates, and proven processing methods\u00a0provides a clear pathway to evaluate opportunities to\u00a0advance the Project on an accelerated timeline toward potential production, subject to completion of updated technical studies and regulatory approvals.\nHistorical Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates(1)(2)\nThe following\u00a0historical mineral resource estimate is derived from the Historical Report.\nClassification\nTonnes (Mt)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nContained Gold (Moz Au)\nMeasured + Indicated\n130.0\n0.48\n2.02\nInferred\n358.0\n0.45\n5.06\nTotal\n488.0\n0.46\n7.08\nThe Historical Report also identifies the following historical mineral reserve estimate, contained within the measured and indicated mineral resources:\nClassification\nTonnes (Mt)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nContained Gold (Moz Au)\nProbable\n40.74\n0.64\n0.83\nNotes:\n1\nThe Company considers the historical estimates to be relevant as they provide an indication of the potential of the Project. However, a qualified person of Galantas has not done sufficient work to classify these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and Galantas is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Galantas has not verified this information and is not relying on it. To verify the historical mineral resource estimate, Galantas will need to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report with respect to the Project (the \"\nNew Report\n\"). Galantas is currently preparing the New Report and intends to file it on SEDAR+ upon the completion of the Transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and applicable securities laws.\n2 The historical mineral resource estimate considers resources optimized in a global open-pit shell using a gold price of US$1,750 per oz Au, and a cut-off grade of 0.15 g/t Au. The historical mineral reserve estimate was based on a gold price of US$1,550 per oz Au, and a cut-off grade of 0.20 g/t Au.\nExploration Opportunities\nThe Project has significant exploration upside, as noted in the Historical Report. Drilling to date has been mostly vertical, leading to opportunities for grade enhancement by angle-drilling vertical and near-vertical higher-grade feeder structures. There is significant potential to increase resources by exploration along strike and down-dip of known mineralization. Additionally, there is a possibility of porphyry-style gold-copper mineralization extending from Teck's adjacent CDA Mine onto the Project with drilling in 2011 between the Project and CDA Mine pits returning up to 30 metres of 0.53% copper. However, this is not guaranteed. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nThere are also indications of a chalcocite enriched copper blanket in the transition zone between oxide and sulfide at the Project, which would represent a high-grade copper target in its own right. Finally, there are numerous gold-copper occurrences on the Project which have not been adequately explored and evaluated, as well as similar occurrences and operating small-scale mines on adjacent ground.\nAdjacent Property Disclosure\nAs discussed in this news release, the Project is located adjacent to the CDA Mine operated by Teck. The Company does not hold, and has no right to acquire, any interest in the CDA Mine. Mineralization and production on adjacent or nearby properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization or future production, costs, or economic results at the Project. Information in relation Teck has been sourced from www.teck.com.\nConditions to Closing\nCompletion of the Transaction is subject to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nTSXV approval, including approval of the Transaction as a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition.\n\u00b7\nSatisfaction of all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7\nReceipt of required shareholder approvals, including minority approval requirements of MI 61-101.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of customary closing conditions.\nApproval of Board of Directors for the Agreement\nAfter consultation with its legal advisors, the board of directors of Galantas unanimously approved the entering into of the Agreement.\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical disclosures in this news release have been reviewed and approved by\u00a0Mr. Gavin Berkenheger, who is considered, by virtue of his education, experience, and professional association, to be a\u00a0Qualified Person\u00a0and\u00a0independent\u00a0for the purposes of\u00a0NI 43-101.\nNeither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThe information contained in this announcement is deemed to constitute\u00a0inside information\u00a0as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the\u00a0Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\u00a0(the \"\nUK MAR\n\"), which forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. This information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under\u00a0Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAbout Galantas Gold Corporation\nGalantas Gold Corporation is a publicly traded gold company focused on the acquisition, development, and advancement of gold assets in stable mining jurisdictions.

Cornavarrow represents an exciting target that has never previously been drilled, and would be key in helping us to glean the wider potential of the gold district.\n\"We're also keen to continue drilling at the main Joshua Vein which runs broadly parallel to and some 450 metres west of the other main Kearney Vein. Positive drilling results from the last few years have delineated trends of dilation zones, which have potential for higher widths of mineralization. Testing the down-dip potential of the dilation zones at Joshua could aid in resource expansion and ultimately add to the Omagh Mine's production capacity.\"\nThe effectiveness of the IP method for defining\nmineralization\ntargets in this terrain was tested by the Company in 2021 when it ran a similar survey over the Elkins Vein. An apparent resistivity IP anomaly aligned north-south coinciding with known\nmineralization\n(see\nGalantas' news release\ndated December 1, 2021). Another IP survey was completed over the Pigeon Top target (1.5\nkilometres\nwest of the mine site) in 2021,\nand\nalso identified a strong north-south trending resistor over\n500 metres\n, coinciding with base-of-till gold anomalies.\nThe\nElkins, Pigeon Top and Cornavarrow\ntargets\nare shown in\nFigure\n1\nand are situated along\na\nsix\n-kilometre\nstrike. According to Consulting Geophysicist\nGraham Reid\nof BRG Ltd\n.,\nthe geophysical anomalies identified during those earlier surveys most likely represent fault structures in the bedrock. North trending faults are a prime exploration target as these are the structures that host\nmineralization\non the mine site.\nIn January 2024,\nGalantas commissioned an IP survey grid over\na 1.4-square-kilometre area at\nthe Cornavarrow target\n(see\nFigure\n2\n).\nCornavarrow lies five\nkilometres\nwest of the Cavanacaw Gold Mine. The area was explored by RioFinex in the late\n1980s.\nGold and base metal anomalies were recorded for float rock and stream sediments at that time; significantly, a small vein exposure was also identified 'Cornavarrow Burn East Showing' (see\nFigure 2\n). A 2003 technical report by ACA Howe contained an intersection grading 1.15 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, 4.2 g/t silver and 1,366 g/t lead over 1.5 metres in width\nacross the portion of visible vein\nand stated that \"what is visible at Cornavarrow Burn East Showing could be the edge of higher-grade mineralization which is not exposed.\" Subsequent exploration by Galantas geologists recorded 3.5 g/t gold for a chipped sample of outcrop.\nFigure 1:\nMap\nshowing the location of key\nexploration\ntargets\n.\nNew geophysical results over Cornavarrow shown in inset and\nFigure\n2\n.\nThe eastern margin of the 900-metre northerly trending resistor lies 100 metres west of the in-situ vein mineralization. BRG Ltd. theorized that the Cornavarrow resistor may represent a zone of increased silicification within the mapped psammites. Galantas geologists have noted silicification associated with gold-bearing quartz veins at Cavanacaw.\nThe target area sits largely within the 'Cavanacaw Member', a competent lithology just north of a thrust fault. The structural setting is therefore similar to that at the mine site. No diamond drilling has been conducted in the area to date.\nFigure 2: Contoured apparent resistivity data over Cornavarrow target. Black dots show grid measurement points.
