It offers end-to-end data centre development services, covering every stage from site selection and feasibility studies through to architectural design, systems integration, project execution, management commissioning, operations and maintenance. With a highly experienced engineering team and a strong track record, Centslink has delivered modular and scalable data centre projects for sectors including energy, government, finance, and telecommunications.\nThe demand for data centres in Southeast Asia is growing rapidly, with the value of the data centre construction market forecast to increase from $5.4bn in 2024 to $11.8bn in 2030 (\nsource\n). AIQ and Centslink intend to seek to capitalise on this development by jointly pursuing data centre projects, leveraging the experience and expertise of Centslink and the local knowledge and network of AIQ as well as its status as a publicly-listed company on the London Stock Exchange. As part of this, Centslink also intends to introduce AIQ to its partners, which represents further potential opportunities for the Company. However, there can be no guarantee that any of this activity will result in the award of a contract or the generation of revenue.\nLi Chun Chung, Executive Director of AIQ, said: \"We are delighted to have entered this strategic partnership with Centslink.
