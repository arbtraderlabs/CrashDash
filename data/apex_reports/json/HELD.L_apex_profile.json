In December 2022, Hellenic Dynamics became the first medical cannabis cultivator to list on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nCultivation and Equipment\n\u00b7\nDetails of adapted Strategy to the changing dynamics of the European medical cannabis market\n\u00b7\nUpdate on GMP Certification\n\u00b7\nRenewable Energy Update\nHellenic Dynamics' Business Model\nHellenic\u00a0Dynamics' core strategy is to\u00a0develop and operate its 40,000 square metre cultivation area for THC-dominant medical cannabis permitted by its licence from its 195,506 square metre\u00a0facility located near Thessaloniki in Northern Greece.\nThe facility benefits from a relatively low cost base resulting from\u00a0a comparatively low cost of power\nand\none of the lowest labour rates for skilled and semi-skilled labour in Europe\nas well as having its own running water supply, meaning that utility costs are significantly below standard market rates for other cultivators.\nThe active THC cultivation area is one of the largest in Europe, capable of producing over 54,000 kg of dried medical cannabis flowers per annum when in full production.\nThe location of the facility also enables Hellenic\u00a0Dynamics to easily export its THC dominant medical flowers to any of the 25 countries in Europe that\u00a0currently allow medical cannabis prescriptions to patients, in a market expected to reach \u20ac43.3 billion per annum by 2027, twice the size of the current north American and Canadian markets combined.\nHellenic Dynamics' adapted strategy\nHellenic Dynamics is currently on track to have its first cultivation underway in late summer 2023.\nHellenic Dynamics is a medical cannabis cultivator. As the industry enters 'cannabis 2.0' which has seen a shake-up of the medical cannabis market, through its agility the Company intends to move with market conditions and demand. This has led to a review of the Company's cultivation strategy which will see Hellenic Dynamics harnessing its scale and low cost operating model in a way that it anticipates will accelerate revenue generation and provide an opportunity to itscustomers. Such a strategy has not yet seen in the cannabis space to date. This modified strategy and operating model, details of which are set out below, is different and disruptive in comparison to the Company's peer group and is designed to match the rapidly evolving regulated medical cannabis market in Europe.\nAs the medical cannabis markets across Europe are now defining the industry standard for the supply of medical cannabis products from cultivator to patient, the certifications for these products is also evolving. Hellenic Dynamics' strategy contained within the Company's prospectus was to gain both Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (\"GACP\") and a EU Good Manufacturing Practices (\"EU-GMP\") certifications. EU-GMP is the most intensive certification for any medical cannabis cultivator to achieve from a capex, opex and time to issuance perspective, with very little advantages for end sales price of products. As the industry enters 'cannabis 2.0' many medical distributors have built their own EU-GMP facilities within their licensed distribution buildings across Germany as have other potential customers in the other markets that Hellenic Dynamics wishes to sell its products into. For this reason, the Company has decided not to invest considerable funds and time into the construction and certification of an EU-GMP facility in the current phase of its development. Hellenic will instead concentrate on the cultivation and supply of GACP flowers to its EU-GMP certified distributors, saving the Company considerable time and expense. This again shows the evolving nature of the European cannabis markets.\nThe Company will release more details of its adapted cultivation strategy in due course.\nCost savings\nIn addition, since the Company's last business update, Hellenic Dynamics has managed to secure significant discounts from its equipment suppliers and has also managed to secure unused second hand equipment, where possible, to keep costs as low as possible while ensuring all equipment is of the highest and modern standards throughout the facility.\nThe Company already benefits from a relatively low cost of power, however Hellenic Dynamics is in advanced discussion with suppliers of solar energy from within Greece to further reduce its cost base. This potential new supply should bring the Company's energy cost down even lower and provide a unique advantage to its business model.\nThe Company will update the market on progress with this development in due course.\nDavinder Rai, CEO of Hellenic Dynamics, commented:\n\"Having evaluated the rapidly changing dynamics of the European medical cannabis markets and seen the challenges and issues that have confronted other cultivators we are adapting our growth strategy to take advantage of opportunities which are emerging as a result of such changes. Our approach will now involve harnessing the scale, low operating cost and expertise at our growing facility to service the burgeoning demand from end use customers in our target markets. I personally believe this strategy is the most disruptive thing to happen to the industry since its legalisation \"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as amended by regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment)\u00a0(EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310.
