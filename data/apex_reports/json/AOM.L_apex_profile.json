Six new customers have been signed so far in H2 FY25, bringing total new logos won in the year to date to nine, versus three in FY24. The initial scope of the new contracts supports existing consensus market expectations* and each of the contracts has further exciting global expansion potential, in line with the Company's Land & Expand growth strategy.\nThe new logo wins are across North America, APAC and EMEIA and follow the Board's decision to invest in the Group's international sales teams. Customer acquisition in North America has been particularly pleasing, with further growth potential in the region supported by a healthy new business pipeline.\nThe new customers secured include blue-chip banks, BPOs and an international healthcare insurance provider, with several adopting ControliQ Series 4, the most advanced iteration of the ControliQ platform, providing access to the latest AI and ML capabilities.\nSenior Leadership Appointment\nThe Group is pleased to announce the appointment of Paul Maguire to its Senior Leadership Team as Group Managing Director, a non-Board position. With over 30 years working in the enterprise software industry and 20 years of executive leadership responsibilities, Paul has a proven track record of scaling enterprise software businesses globally, to achieve consistent and sustainable growth. Most recently Paul was Senior Vice President and Managing Director APAC & EMEA for Coupa, a leading Business Spend Management platform and was previously Senior Vice President and Managing Director APAC, EMEA & LATAM for Appian, a leading platform for process orchestration, automation and intelligence.\nActiveOps Executive Chair, Richard Jeffery, commented:\n\"\nIt is pleasing to report\non the strong new business momentum we have seen around all our territories so far this year. These wins, alongside our sustained expansion performance, are a clear example of the need for our solutions as large enterprises continue to invest in technologies that boost efficiency and improve employee satisfaction.\n\"I am delighted to welcome Paul to the Senior Leadership Team, he is joining us at an exciting time and his experience and track-record of success will help further drive ActiveOps' growth and development.\n\"While enterprise sales cycles remain elongated, our performance so far this financial year gives us confidence that the strategic decisions we have taken to invest in our product, positioning and sales teams mean we are well placed to continue to build on our achievements.\"\nNotes\n*\nIn so far as the Board is aware, as at 4 February 2025, consensus market expectations are: FY25 - Revenue of \u00a329.4m and adjusted EBITDA of \u00a32.3m; FY26 - Revenue of \u00a331.6m and adjusted EBITDA of \u00a33.0m.\nFor more information, please contact:\nActiveOps\nVia Alma\nRichard Jeffery, Executive Chair\nwww.activeops.com\nEmma Salthouse, Chief Financial Officer\nInvestec Bank plc\n- Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker\n+44 (0)20 7597 5970\nPatrick Robb / Nick Prowting\nCanaccord Genuity Limited -\nJoint Broker\n+44 (0)20 7523 8000\nSimon Bridges / Harry Gooden / Harry Rees\nAlma Strategic Communications\n+ 44(0) 203 405 0205\nCaroline Forde / Will Ellis Hancock / Louisa El-Ahwal\nAbout ActiveOps\nActiveOps is a Software as a Service business, dedicated to helping organisations create more value from their service operations.
