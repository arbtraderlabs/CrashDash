Following the announcement of a JORC Mineral Resource upgrade of 500% at the Company's Molaoi zinc/silver/lead deposit in Greece, the Board has elected to mainly focus its staff and financial resources on the Molaoi project.\nWith this, Thomas acknowledges that the Company already has quality leadership capability in the development of mining projects. Thomas intends to pursue his other businesses outside of mining. The Board wishes Thomas all the best for the future and appreciates the assistance provided during his time with Rockfire.\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\n:\ninfo@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / George Payne (Corporate Finance)\nGuy McDougall / Kelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nNotes to Editors\nRockfire Resources plc (LON: ROCK) is a mineral exploration and development company with a portfolio of 100%-owned mineral projects including a high-grade zinc deposit in Greece and gold and copper projects in Queensland Australia.\n\u00b7\nThe Molaoi deposit in Greece has a JORC resource of 1,090,000 tonnes of zinc, 260,000 tonnes of lead and 19.1 million ounces of silver.\nThe Molaoi deposit in Greece has a JORC Inferred Mineral Resource of 15 million tonnes @ 7.26 % Zn,1.75 % Pb and 39.5 g/t Ag, for 1,500,000 tonnes of ZnEq.

Early on Monday the 8th of December, the drill hole is at 140.00m depth.\n\u00b7\nAt the completion of this current drilling campaign, it is expected that Molaoi will host the only defined Inferred Resource of germanium in Europe and one of only two quoted germanium resources globally.\n\u00b7\nMassive sulphides are being encountered in hole HMO-010 at the predicted depths in accordance with the resource model.\n\u00b7\npXRF results so far in hole HMO-010 are reading high grades of zinc, silver, and lead. Between 97.55m and 98.20m depth, individual spot readings peak at 13.9% Zn, 1.48% Pb and 133ppm Ag. The pXRF equipment does not measure germanium values, but germanium will be analysed at the laboratory.\n\u00b7\nThe main target lodes lie beneath the current drill depth with 200m being the top of the target zone for mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nOur objective to increase the zinc/silver/lead resource confidence from Inferred to Indicated continues and drilling is expected to continue throughout the first half of 2026.\n\u00b7\nLong lead-time components of our planned pre-feasibility study have now been commissioned. A Hydrology Study and an Ecological Study have now commenced. Such long lead-time aspects of the pre-feasibility require a minimum of 12 months of baseline monitoring and measurements. Rockfire has commissioned these early to ensure a timely completion of all the studies required prior to mining.\nThe cleanliness of the pXRF machine was established by measuring a BLANK reference material (a translucent quartz crystal) at the beginning of each day. A Certified Reference Material (CRM) specific to volcanic-hosted massive sulphide Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au ore (ORES 620) was measured for accuracy/precision of the pXRF machine with a reading taken at the beginning of each day.\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire, commented:\n\"Our third drill hole is encountering improved ground conditions. The rig is 672m south of hole HMO-008, and 396m south of hole HMO-009, where broken and fractured ground created difficult drilling conditions in both holes. It should be kept in mind that the zinc resource is 2.2km long so far and there are still 28 holes to be drilled within this resource distance.\"\n\"We will continue to update the market as our drilling continues.\"\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\n:\ninfo@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\u00a0/\u00a0Ashur Joseph\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMatt Butlin\u00a0(Sales and Corporate Broking)\nCMC Markets UK Plc\u00a0(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3003 8632\nDouglas Crippen\nQualified Person Statement\nThe technical information in this announcement is based on information compiled by Mr David Price, the Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire Resources plc, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (F.AusIMM).

The University of Patras is a 3.5-hour drive from Molaoi.\nSome of the key findings from this on-going research are:\n\u00b7\nUsing Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry analysis ('LA-ICP-MS'), sphalerite crystals have been found to host high-grade gallium up to\n858 g/t Ga\nand a peak silver value of\n3,364 g/t Ag\n.\n\u00b7\nSurprisingly, pyrite crystals at Molaoi are also a strong host of other high-value minerals, including maximum values of\n20.7% Ni, 1.37% Cu and 245.0 g/t Au\nThis research has positive implications for the future exploration strategy and may contribute to the long-term economics of the project.\nIt is yet to be determined if any of these elements can be extracted in sufficient quantities, or at economic grades.\n\u00b7\nGallium is typically elevated (less than 30g/t Ga) in Rockfire's drill core, but currently it is unknown if gallium reports to any of the concentrates as a by-product. This will be tested in the next round of metallurgical test work.\n\u00b7\nNickel and copper are routinely analysed in Rockfire drill holes and values are typically low (Ni less than 30g/t and Cu less than 500g/t). In metallurgical tests done by Rockfire so far, copper reports to a lead-silver concentrate with grades of 2% Cu, which may prove to be a valuable by-product. It is not known if nickel reports to any of the concentrates as a by-product.\n\u00b7\nGold is only sporadically analysed in the Rockfire core, and specifically in zones of\nintense silicification\nand within veins. Values are typically low (less than 0.05g/t), but gold is known to report to a lead-silver concentrate with grades of 0.5g/t, again proving the potential for another high-value by-product.\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Stellios Tombros, the University of Patras has a multidisciplinary and integrative research team conducting an advanced scientific study of the germanium (Ge) potential of the Molaoi Zn-Pb (\u00b1 Ag, Ge) ore deposit.\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire, commented:\n\"The research being undertaken on rocks from Molaoi continues to unearth surprises and key findings. It is this excellent work by Dr. Tombros and the team at the University of Patras that will enable Rockfire to understand the emplacement, form, geochemistry, extractability, and commercial aspects of the multiple critical, base and precious metals being identified at Molaoi.\"\n\"Of the recent findings, the nickel and high-grade gold are the two biggest surprises, providing further evidence that Molaoi is more akin to a deposit formed in an epithermal setting. It is becoming more apparent that the Molaoi deposit is the result of a continuously evolving ore deposit, with multiple mineralizing episodes.\"\n\"It is yet to be determined if any of these elements can be extracted in sufficient quantities, or at economic grades. It is encouraging to learn that these metals are present at high grades within the sulphides at Molaoi. The ability to extract any of these elements commercially will be determined in the next round of planned metallurgical test work.\"\n\"With drilling now underway, the Company is determined to lift the resource confidence, leading to feasibility as quickly as possible. The market will be informed as drilling results become available.\"\nFor further information on the Company, please visit\nwww.rockfireresources.com\nor contact the following:\nRockfire Resources plc\n:\ninfo@rockfire.co.uk\nDavid Price, Chief Executive Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker):\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\u00a0/\u00a0Dan Dearden-Williams\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nMatt Butlin\u00a0(Sales and Corporate Broking)\nCMC Markets UK Plc\u00a0(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3003 8632\nDouglas Crippen\nGlossary\nItem\nDefinition\n\"3D\"\nthree dimensional\n'' Ag''\n\"Au\"\nSilver\nGold\n\"Cu\"\n\"Ga\"\nCopper\nGallium\n'' Ge''\ngermanium\n'' g/t''\ngrams per tonne\n''JORC''\nJoint Ore Resource Committee\n\"km\"\nKilometre\n\"m\"\n\"Ni\"\nMetre\nNickel\n'' Pb''\nlead\n\"ppm\"\nparts per million\n\"pXRF\"\nportable X-Ray Florescence\n\"VMS\"\nvolcanogenic massive sulphide\n''' Zn''\nzinc\n\"ZnEq''\nzinc equivalent\nQualified Person Statement\nThe technical information in this announcement is based on information compiled by Mr David Price, the Chief Executive Officer of Rockfire Resources plc, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (F.AusIMM).
