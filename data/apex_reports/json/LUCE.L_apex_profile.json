The Group designs and manufactures its market-leading range of wiring accessories, EV chargers, LED lighting, and portable power products at its state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, distributing them through professional, wholesale and retail channels.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.lucecoplc.com\n.\nForward-looking statements\nThis announcement contains forward\n\u2011\nlooking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries, sectors and markets in which the Group operates. It is believed that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, but they may be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. No assurances can be given that the forward\n\u2011\nlooking statements in this announcement will be realised.\nThe forward\n\u2011\nlooking statements reflect the knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward\n\u2011\nlooking statements. Nothing in this announcement should be construed as a profit forecast.\nUse of alternative performance measures\nThe commentary in both the Chief Executive Officer's and Chief Financial Officer's Reviews uses alternative performance measures, which are described as \"Adjusted\". Definitions of these measures can be found in note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The measures provide additional information for users on the underlying performance of the business, enabling consistent year-on-year comparisons.\nChief Executive's review\nPerformance highlights\nDuring the first half of 2025, we delivered revenue of \u00a3125.7m (H1 2024: \u00a3109.6m) and Adjusted Operating Profit of \u00a313.8m (H1 2024: \u00a312.6m), which is at the top end of the range reported in our July trading update. Revenue growth was supported by \u00a315.5m of revenue from acquisitions, in addition to 2.0% like-for-like organic growth, once again outperforming our key end markets.\nOur lean operating model has enabled us to deliver a strong Adjusted Gross Profit Margin of 42.0%, with an Adjusted Operating Margin of 11.0% despite the impact of some seasonality and investment in the integration of the CMD and D-Line acquisitions.\nContinued market outperformance driven by competitive advantages\nOur commercial position and continued outperformance is underpinned by Luceco's core competitive advantages.\n1. Strong, well-invested brands across our segments, with well-established positions with key customers and multiple sales channels providing a significant competitive moat and predictable volumes in our core product segments.\n2. The strength of our brands and relationships is underpinned by our vertically-integrated central manufacturing hub in Jiaxing, China, which gives us full control of our supply chain and flexibility in our manufacturing operations, allowing us to both continuously improve our operations and provide best-in-class customer service.\n3. In turn, this flexibility and control facilitates our continuous product improvement and innovation, providing an unparalleled level of agility in product development to continuously enhance the functionality of our existing product range, along with organically developing new products in adjacent categories to enhance our growth prospects.\nThe economic growth conditions remain suppressed in the UK and challenging in some of our other territories such as Mexico, Asia Pacific and the USA. However, despite the subdued market backdrop, our innovative product portfolio and superior sales channel access have ensured that we have continued to see resilient residential RMI markets.\nOur like-for-like revenue growth for the UK business was 3.6% in the first half of 2025 which is put into context when we compare ourselves to the wider construction market, with data from the Construction Products Association (\"CPA\") indicating that output of our addressable markets is forecast to increase by 1.9% for calendar year 2025. We expect our UK business to once again outperform the market in 2025.\nWithin the CPA data, there is expected growth of 2.1% in the UK Residential sector in 2025 for the combined new build and the Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (\"RMI\") sectors. The Non-residential market growth is expected to be 0.9% with infrastructure growth of 1.9% for the calendar year 2025.\nThe flexibility and control over our manufacturing operations has also allowed us to improve our Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to 42.0% (HY 2024: 41.0%), providing further confidence that the\nsteps the business has taken in recent years leave us well positioned to continue to outperform market conditions.\nWell-positioned to deliver growth\nThe strength of Luceco's commercial position and competitive advantages position us well to pursue structural growth trends to provide further opportunities for above market growth.\nThe fundamental growth drivers supporting our industry and business are:\n\u00b7\nThe drive towards net zero,\n\u00b7\nOngoing regulatory change,\n\u00b7\nNew technology and legislation changes and\n\u00b7\nAn underlying need to invest in UK housing stock, providing confidence that our markets will deliver healthy and stable growth over the medium and long term.\nWe are particularly excited by the growth opportunities within the Electric Vehicle (\"EV\") market. The UK's EV market is experiencing rapid growth due to a combination of factors driven by the global climate agenda, resulting in increased government incentives and therefore rising consumer interest, resulting in an expansion of EV charging infrastructure. The UK has seen an increase in used EV sales as more affordable options become available and consumer battery concerns are addressed. During the period, the Group's EV product sales increased by 93% and we are excited by the increasing market opportunity and our strong product offering.\nWe have continued to make significant strategic progress during the period, positioning Luceco to deliver through-the-cycle, above market growth. The two strategic priorities to deliver market growth are:\n1. Product innovation to grow our presence in higher-growth segments, such as EV chargers, and to enhance our market position in existing markets.\n2. Targeted M&A to expand the breadth and depth of our product ranges and customer relationships while simultaneously delivering synergistic growth from our manufacturing facility in Jiaxing, China.\nDelivering above market growth through product innovation\nEnergy transition product development\nThe structural opportunity posed by decarbonisation and the energy transition continues to drive our product innovation; for instance, our Titan All-in-One LED Highbay Light consolidates 72 SKUs into four, reducing waste and increasing flexibility for distributors and contractors. Our Sync Energy portfolio, including EV chargers and the recently launched Home Energy Management system (HEMs), facilitates clean energy transitions. The Home Energy Management system empowers homeowners to manage both grid and renewable energy more effectively, supporting emission reductions and energy optimisation. By prioritising efficiency and low carbon solutions, our products contribute significantly to sustainable advancement.\nIn 2024, we launched Sync Energy to reflect our expanded range of sustainable energy solutions. A major milestone was the development of our HEMs, which launched during H1 2025. This system stores energy in modular batteries from the grid and renewable sources, allowing consumers to use lower-cost energy at optimal times. With the growing demand for EV charging and renewable energy, home energy management is a key growth area.\nWe advanced our EV charging solutions with the \"Pro Charge\" range and the EV Balancer, which connects up to 16 chargers, ensuring safe and efficient charging. Our Sync Energy App enhances user control with features like \"Tariff Sense\" and \"Solar Mode,\" optimising charging times and maximizing self-generated energy.\nOngoing innovation in Lighting and Wiring Accessories\nWiring Accessories delivered another robust performance this period with our products consistently recognised by electricians for their ease of installation, reliability, and superior availability. Consequently, many industry professionals have utilised our Wiring Accessories throughout their careers and whilst we take pride in their loyalty, it remains something we continually strive to maintain. The enduring strength of our customer relationships enables us to collaboratively meet end consumer needs. Our sales and R&D teams remain closely integrated, driving extension of product lines and securing new business opportunities.\nWe also enhanced our Wiring Accessories and Masterplug product lines, launching Superfast USB-C sockets and new USB-C wall chargers to meet the demand for fast-charging solutions. Our commitment to purposeful innovation drives our strategy, with our speed to market enabling us to gain market share and create value through differentiated, high-margin products.\nIn the Group's Lighting division, we are seeing success from the award-winning Titan All-in-One LED Highbay Light under the Luceco Lighting brand, which launched in the latter half of 2024, offering adjustable wattage, colour temperature, and beam angle for optimal industrial lighting.\nDelivering above market growth through M&A\nThe business has demonstrated sustained growth both organically and through strategic mergers and acquisitions, aligned with our capital allocation framework and supported by our solid cash generation. Our core competitive advantages allow us to acquire complementary businesses, utilise our superior channel access to enhance growth through new market entry and product categories, and simultaneously achieve synergistic growth through our Jiaxing manufacturing site.\nIn September 2024, the acquisition of CMD Limited (\"CMD\") was completed. Established in 1984, CMD is a leading manufacturer of wiring accessories for commercial buildings in the UK, including advanced distribution solutions and ergonomic office products. In February 2024, we concluded the acquisition of D-Line (Europe) Limited (\"D-Line\"), headquartered in Tyne & Wear, UK. D-Line specialises in innovative cable management products and serves diverse customers across the UK, Europe, and North America, with operations including a dedicated facility in Kentucky, USA. These businesses are integrating well and we are capturing the synergies identified through the acquisition process.\nWith our strong cash generation we continue to explore M&A opportunities that have a strong strategic fit and the potential to deliver future growth, with a particular focus on acquisition targets that complement our energy transition related product categories.\nA further period of cash generation, driven by organic growth in addition to synergy delivery from previous acquisitions, means we end the half year with Bank Net Debt of \u00a368.0m with a Bank leverage ratio of 1.6x which is comfortably within our 1-2x range.\nOutlook\nThe Group's diverse portfolio and channels and in particular its strong product performance in the emerging EV sector have ensured continued growth in both revenues and profits, despite the challenging UK economic conditions. The balance sheet remains robust, with debt levels comfortably within our target range, providing flexibility to invest in new organic growth initiatives and M&A opportunities aligned with our capital allocation policy.\nWe are optimistic that confidence in our sectors of the economy will recover further in the second half of 2025. The Group's trading remains in line with expectations for further growth in the year ending December 2025.\nJOHN HORNBY\nChief Executive Officer\n8 September 2025\nChief Financial Officer's review\nSummary of reported results\nSummary results (\u00a3m)\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nRevenue\n125.7\n109.6\nOperating profit\n11.6\n10.1\nProfit before tax\n7.8\n8.7\nTaxation\n(1.2)\n(1.8)\nProfit for the period\n6.6\n6.9\nOperating profit of \u00a311.6m was ahead of the prior year by 14.9% - a strong result considering the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Improvements in gross margin continue as cost pressures ease ensuring that margins are moving towards through-the-cycle levels. Profit before tax was behind the prior year but this reflects a higher interest charge with our new \u00a3120m facility.\nAdjusting items\nCertain alternative performance measures (\"APMs\") have been included within this report. These APMs are used by the Board to monitor and manage the performance of the Group, in order to ensure that decisions taken align with the Group's long-term interests. A table summarising the reconciliation of adjusted measures to statutory measures is included in note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Adjusting items are those which we consider unusual by virtue of their size or incidence and therefore not representative of our underlying trading performance. We have identified \u00a32.2m of such items within our reported operating profit for 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a32.5m). They consist of:\n\u00b7\nAmortisation of acquired intangibles: \u00a31.7m (H1 2024: \u00a31.0m)\n\u00b7\nAcquisition related costs: \u00a30.4m (H1 2024: \u00a31.5m)\n\u00b7\nFair value movements of hedging portfolio: \u00a30.1m (H1 2024: nil)\nAdjusted Operating Profit for the period, excluding the items above, was therefore \u00a313.8m (H1 2024: \u00a312.6m). Additionally there were \u00a30.8m of net finance cost items which form part of the profit before tax adjustments - these relate to loan fee write-offs and interest rate swaps.\nIncome statement\nRevenue\nRevenue of \u00a3125.7m was \u00a316.1m (14.7%) higher than H1 2024 with the main movements summarised below:\nBridge from H1 2024\nRevenue bridge:\n\u00a3m\nChange %\n2024\n109.6\nAcquisitions/closures\n15.5\n+14.1%\nLike-for-like increase1\n2.2\n+2.0%\nConstant Currency2\n127.3\n16.1%\nCurrency movements\n(1.6)\n(1.4%)\n2025\n125.7\n14.7%\n1. Like-for-like revenue increase excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions, see note 10 of the condensed consolidated financial statements\n2. 2025 revenue translated at 2024 exchange rates\nTotal revenue increased by 14.7% which includes the impact of the acquisitions of D-Line in February 2024 and CMD in September 2024. Like-for-like revenue increased by 2.0% during the period - however we have seen an acceleration in revenue from quarter one to quarter two. Quarter one like-for-like growth was 0.6% and quarter two like-for-like growth was 3.2%.\nWe group our customers into the following sales channels:\n\u00b7\nRetail: Distributors serving consumers only, including DIY sheds, pure-play online retailers and grocers\n\u00b7\nHybrid: Distributors serving both consumers and professionals, typically with multi-channel service options\n\u00b7\nProfessional Wholesale: Distributors serving professionals only, largely via a branch network\n\u00b7\nProfessional Projects: Sale agreed by Luceco direct with professionals, but largely fulfilled via Professional Wholesale\nPerformance by sales channel was as follows:\nLike-for-like revenue by sales channel:\nH1 2025\n\u00a3m\nH1 2025\n% of total\nChange v H1 2024 %\nRetail\n30.2\n27.0%\n+1.7%\nHybrid\n24.4\n21.8%\n(2.0%)\nProfessional Wholesale\n30.5\n27.3%\n+8.5%\nProfessional Projects\n26.7\n23.9%\n(0.7%)\nLike-for-like revenue\n111.8\n100.0%\n+2.0%\nCurrency impact\n(1.6)\nAcquisitions\n15.5\nTOTAL\n125.7\n14.7%\nThere are different trends across the sales channels with particularly strong growth in the Professional Wholesale sector of 8.5% - this has largely been driven by strong EV performance. The Retail and Hybrid channel was flat in the period although the timing of Chinese New Year has impacted the comparatives due to the larger proportion of \"Free on Board\" (\"FOB\") sales in Q4 2024 which impacted sales in Q1 2025. The Professional Projects channel shrank by 0.7% over the half year but there is a strong order book for the second half so we expect growth in this channel by the end of the year.\nRevenue by geographical location of customer:\nH1 2025\n\u00a3m\nH1 2024\n\u00a3m\nChange v\nH1 2024 %\nUK\n102.0\n86.8\n+17.5%\nEurope\n10.7\n9.5\n+12.6%\nMiddle East and Africa\n2.3\n2.8\n(17.9%)\nAsia Pacific\n1.3\n1.7\n(23.5%)\nAmericas\n9.4\n8.8\n+6.8%\nTotal revenue\n125.7\n109.6\n+14.7%\nThe change in revenue by geography has a number of characteristics by location of the customer. Within the UK, the acquisition of CMD has contributed \u00a311.3m in the period, which means the underlying growth in the UK was over 3%.\nWith the acquisition of D-Line, this has boosted our sales representation in both Europe and the Americas during the prior year and this - with overall sales growth increasing by 12.6% and 6.8% in Europe and the Americas respectively.\nThere was a reduction in growth in the Middle East and Africa which largely reflects timing issues in revenue.\nProfitability\nAdjusted Operating Profit of \u00a313.8m for H1 2025 was \u00a31.2m higher than H1 2024. The key drivers were as follows:\nAdjusted Operating profit\nBridge from\nH1 2024\n\u00a3m\nBridge from\nH1 2023\n\u00a3m\n2024/23\n12.6\n10.8\nAcquisitions/closures\n1.5\n0.5\nOrganic increase/(decrease)1\n(0.3)\n1.3\n2025/24\n13.8\n12.6\n1. Organic movements exclude the impact of acquisitions\nThe organic operating profit movement includes the cost of targeted investments in some key areas of the Group's capabilities designed to generate future value, including marketing, EV charging and the lighting teams. Overhead wage inflation has been somewhat less pronounced than that experienced coming into 2025. As previously outlined, the Group has strong operational leverage, so with future growth we expect operating margin to make further progress.\nLooking forward, we continue to drive efficiency improvements within our manufacturing facility which will serve to benefit 2025 and beyond.\nOperating costs\nAdjusted operating costs increased by \u00a36.7m to \u00a339.0m (+20.7%), which a significant part reflects the acquisitions of CMD and D-line. Removing these acquisitions, underlying operating costs increased by \u00a31.9m of which \u00a30.3m relates to variable costs, \u00a30.8m relates to living wage cost increases and \u00a30.8m relates to investment in the business and customer experience.\nNet finance expense\nThe Adjusted Net Finance Expense was \u00a33.0m in the first half (H1 2024: \u00a31.4m). Our policy is to mitigate the interest risk by swaps which fix the interest rate applicable to approximately 70% of our borrowings on a rolling three-year basis with 30% of our borrowings remaining at floating interest rates.\nTaxation\nWe currently expect a Group adjusted effective tax rate of c.21% for the year ending 31 December 2025. There was a deferred tax asset recognised in the period in relation to the utilisation of USA tax losses.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted1 Free Cash Flow (\u00a3m)\nAdjusted1\nH1 2025\nAdjusted1 H1 2024\nOperating profit\n13.8\n12.6\nDepreciation and amortisation\n4.5\n3.6\nEBITDA\n18.3\n16.2\nChanges in working capital\n(2.4)\n(11.8)\nOther items\n0.7\n0.7\nOperating Cash flow\n16.6\n5.1\nOperating cash conversion2\n120.3%\n40.5%\nNet capital expenditure\n(3.8)\n(2.8)\nInterest paid\n(2.9)\n(1.3)\nTax received/(paid)\n0.4\n(2.7)\nFree Cash Flow\n10.3\n(1.7)\nFree Cash Flow as % revenue\n8.2%\n(1.6%)\n1. A reconciliation of the reported to Adjusted results is shown within note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements\n2. Adjusted Operating Cash Conversion is defined as Adjusted Operating Cash Flow divided by Adjusted Operating Profit\nAdjusted free cash flow was strong in the first half of the year with an inflow of \u00a310.3m versus an outflow of \u00a31.7m in the prior year. Lower tax was paid in the period predominantly due to refunds from 2022/3 and RDEC.\nCapital expenditure\nThe Group's net capital expenditure consists of capitalised product development costs and the purchase of physical assets. Capital expenditure was \u00a33.8m in the first half (H1 2024: \u00a32.8m) and was 3.0% of revenue (H1 2024: 2.6%) hitting our target range. We continue to see opportunities to invest in low risk, high return automation projects in our Chinese production facility and continue to invest in R&D projects, particularly in relation to acquired businesses.\nCapital structure and returns\nReturn on capital\nReturn on Capital Invested was in line with the prior year at 20.0% (H1 2024: 19.6%). We expect average Return on Capital Invested through the economic cycle to be 20% or higher as recent acquisitions are fully integrated into the Group.\nCapital structure\nThe business continues to consistently generate ample cash flow to support its dividend policy and fund M&A activity.\n\u00a3m\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nChange\nReported net debt\n\u00a374.0m\n\u00a345.7m\n+61.9%\nLess: IFRS 16 Finance Leases\n(\u00a36.4m)\n(\u00a37.0m)\n(8.6%)\nFinance Leases - pre-IFRS 16\n\u00a30.4m\n\u00a30.7m\n(42.9%)\nBank Net Debt\n\u00a368.0\n\u00a339.4m\n+72.6%\nBank Net Debt : EBITDA\n1.6x\n1.1x\n+45.5%\nThe Group's Bank Net Debt : EBITDA ratio of 1.6x remains comfortably within the 1-2x target range - which is in line with the year-end number. The Group's non-utilised facilities totalled \u00a352.4m and the facility matures in May 2028. The Group is therefore in a position both to invest organically and execute its M&A strategy.\nThe Company's bank ratio position and headroom at 30 June 2025 were as follows:\nH1 2025 Bank position\nCovenant\nActual\nHeadroom\nBank Net Debt : EBITDA\n3.0 : 1\n1.6 : 1\nBank Net Debt headroom: \u00a357.7m\nBank EBITDA headroom: \u00a319.2m\nBank EBITDA : Adjusted Net Finance Expense\n4.0 : 1\n14.0 : 1\nBank EBITDA headroom: \u00a329.9m\nNet Finance Expense headroom: \u00a37.5m\nThe key measures which management use to evaluate the Group's use of its financial resources and capital management are set out below:\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nAdjusted1 Earnings Per Share (pence)\n5.9\n5.7\nBank Net Debt : EBITDA (times)\n1.6x\n1.1x\nAdjusted1 Free Cash Flow (\u00a3m)\n10.3\n(1.7)\n1. Note 1 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides an explanation of the Group's alternative performance measures.\nThe Group complied with its bank requirements throughout the first half with significant headroom on all metrics. The Group has conducted a going concern review for the first half of 2025 and this is outlined in note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Group has a strong balance sheet and significant facility headroom under even a realistic severe but plausible downside scenario. No bank breaches occur in any of our severe but plausible downside scenarios, all of which are before any mitigating actions, illustrating our financial resilience.\nDividends\nThe Board will pay an interim dividend of 1.8p per share, up 5.9% over the prior year. This will be paid to shareholders on 24 October 2025 who are on the register on 19 September 2025, and the shares will be marked ex-dividend on 18 September 2025. The last day for dividend reinvestment (\"DRIP\") elections is 3 October 2025. The interim dividend is a payout ratio of 40%, with one third paid at the interim and the remaining two thirds being paid at the final dividend.\nOperating segment review\nThe revenue and profit generated by the Group's operating segments are shown below. Operating profits are stated after the proportional allocation of fixed central overheads. The Group's central allocation of head office and shared services costs were \u00a34.5m for Wiring Accessories, \u00a33.0m for LED Lighting and \u00a33.1m for Portable Power.\nWiring Accessories\nAdjusted1\nReported\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nChange\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nChange\nRevenue\n\u00a361.0m\n\u00a348.9m\n+24.7%\n\u00a361.0m\n\u00a348.9m\n+24.7%\nOperating profit\n\u00a39.3m\n\u00a39.4m\n(1.1%)\n\u00a38.0m\n\u00a37.8m\n+2.6%\nOperating margin %\n15.2%\n19.2%\n(4.0ppts)\n13.1%\n16.0%\n(2.9ppts)\n1.

A reconciliation of the reported to Adjusted results is shown within note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements\nThe Group entered the lighting market in 2013 as the industry adopted LED technology which represents about 29% of Group revenue and 17% of the Group's operating profit.\nRevenue from the LED Lighting segment was slightly ahead of the prior year by 1.1%. Demand has been particularly strong in the professional projects space in the period, as demand for energy-saving retrofits grows. Adjusted Operating Profit of \u00a32.3m was significantly ahead of the prior year by \u00a31.6m with improvements from DW Windsor particularly pleasing.\nPortable Power\nAdjusted1\nReported\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nChange\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nChange\nRevenue\n\u00a328.0m\n\u00a324.4m\n+14.8%\n\u00a328.0m\n\u00a324.4m\n+14.8%\nOperating profit\n\u00a32.2m\n\u00a32.5m\n(12.0%)\n\u00a32.1m\n\u00a32.3m\n(8.7%)\nOperating margin %\n7.9%\n10.2%\n(2.3ppts)\n7.5%\n9.4%\n(1.9ppts)\n1. A reconciliation of the reported to Adjusted results is shown within note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements\nThe Portable Power segment consists of two main elements:\n\u00b7\nCable reels, extension leads and associated accessories sold under the Masterplug brand\n\u00b7\nEV chargers sold under the Sync Energy brand\nThis business segment generates 22% of Group revenue and 16% of Group Adjusted Operating Profit. Revenue in the period was 14.8% up although operating margin reduced slightly.\nEV charger sales totalled \u00a38.3m, with outstanding growth of 93% in the period. We remain excited about the opportunities, in both retail and commercial spaces, that this new sector will provide as the vehicle market moves closer towards electrification.\nGoing concern\nThe directors have reviewed the current financial performance and liquidity of the business and assessed its resilience\nto a reduction in sales through a series of scenarios. The directors report that, having reviewed current performance\nand forecasts, they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operations for\nthe foreseeable future. For this reason, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the interim\nfinancial statements.\nWILL HOY\nChief Financial Officer\n8 September 2025\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") update\nWe continue to make progress on our ESG workstreams:\n\u00b7\nWe committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)\nand this was validated by the SBTi during the first half of the year.

It is also responsible for determining the level of risk appetite it is prepared to take in the ordinary course of business to achieve the Group's strategic objectives and to ensure that appropriate and sufficient resource is allocated to the management and mitigation of risk.\nIn addition to the risk management framework, the Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee for reviewing the overall process of assessing business risks and managing the impact on the Group. The Group's risk management process is set out below.\nThe principal risks identified, and actions taken to minimise their potential impact are detailed on pages 65 to 70 in the Annual Report and Accounts. This is not an exhaustive list but those the Board believes may have an adverse effect on the Group's cash flow and profitability.\nIn determining whether it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements, the Directors have considered these principal risks and uncertainties. The Viability Statement on pages 69 to 70 of the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts considers the prospects of the Group should a number of these risks crystallise together.\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting\nas adopted for use in the UK;\n\u00b7\nthe interim management report includes a fair, balanced and understandable review of the information required by:\n(a) DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n(b) DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, being related party transactions that have taken place in the first six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and any changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report that could do so.\nApproved by a Committee of the Board\non 8 September 2025\nand signed on its behalf.\nJOHN HORNBY\nChief Executive

Basis of preparation\nLuceco plc (the \"Company\") is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements (\"interim financial statements\") for the period ended 30 June 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the \"Group\"). The Group is primarily involved in the supply of\nwiring accessories, EV chargers, LED lighting and portable power products\nto global markets (see note 2).\nThis condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted for use in the UK.\nThe annual financial statements of the Group for the year ending 31 December 2024 have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the company's published consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 which were prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (\"UK-adopted IFRS\").\nThe interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors and have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The audit report on those accounts was unqualified and did not contain any statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim financial statements have not been audited or reviewed by auditors pursuant to the Auditing Practices Board's guidance on the review of interim financial information.\nRisks and uncertainties\nAn outline of the key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group is described in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts. Risk is an inherent part of doing business and the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage the key risks it faces.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have concluded that it is reasonable to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. This is based on an expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of signing these accounts and our cash flow forecasts support this. The Group has reported a profit before tax of \u00a37.8m for the six months to June 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a38.7m), has net current assets of \u00a379.5m (30 June 2024: \u00a367.6m and 31 December 2024: \u00a379.4m) and net assets of \u00a392.1m (30 June 2024: \u00a390.5m and 31 December 2024: \u00a395.8m), net debt of \u00a374.0m (30 June 2024: \u00a345.7m and 31 December 2024: \u00a375.1m) and net cash inflow from operating activities\nof \u00a317.0m\n(six months to 30 June 2024: inflow \u00a32.2m and 12 months to 31 December 2024: inflow \u00a314.7m). The bank facilities mature on 21 May 2028 (with a 2 year extension option, subject to agreement).\nThe capital resources at the Group's disposal at 30 June 2025:\n\u00b7\nA revolving credit facility of \u00a3120.0m, \u00a375.1m drawn at 30 June 2025\nThe revolving credit facility requires the Group to comply with the following quarterly financial bank ratios:\n\u00b7\nClosing Bank Net Debt of no more than 3.0 times Bank EBITDA for the preceding 12-month period\n\u00b7\nBank EBITDA of no less than 4.0 times Bank Net Finance Expense for the preceding 12\n\u2011\nmonth period\nThe Directors ran scenario tests on the severe but plausible downside case at the 2024 year end and for the first half of 2025 have completed a reverse stress test which is implausible. The assumptions in the 2024 year end scenarios were as follows: concentration risks with associated operations (25% reduction in revenue for three months followed by 50% reduction for three months and 20% increase in shipping costs during the period) and macroeconomic, political and environmental risks (18-month recession with a 10% reduction in revenue and gross profit). These severe but plausible downside scenarios do not lead to any breach in bank ratio nor any breach in facility. All modelling has been conducted without any mitigation activity. There have been no changes to post balance sheet liquidity positions. The Directors are confident that the Group and Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nStatutory and non-statutory measures of performance - adjusted measures\nThe financial statements contain all the information and disclosures required by the relevant accounting standards and regulatory obligations that apply to the Group.\nThe Group's performance is assessed using a number of financial measures which are not defined under IFRS (the financial reporting framework applied by the Group). Management uses the adjusted or alternative performance measures (APMs) as a part of their internal financial performance monitoring and when assessing the future impact of operating decisions. The APMs disclose the adjusted performance of the Group excluding specific items. The measures allow a more effective year-on-year comparison and identification of core business trends by removing the impact of items occurring either outside the normal course of operations or as a result of intermittent activities such as a corporate acquisition. The Group separately reports acquisition costs, other exceptional items and other specific items in the condensed consolidated income statement which, in the Directors' judgement, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size and incidence in order for users of the financial statements to obtain a balanced view of the financial information and the underlying performance of the business.\nIn following the guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authorities, the Group has included a condensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated cash flow statement that have both Statutory and Adjusted performance measures. The definitions of the measures used in these results are below and the principles to identify adjusting items have been applied on a basis consistent with previous years.\nNature of measure\nRelated IFRS measure\nRelated IFRS source\nDefinition\nUse/relevance\nAdjusted Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin\nCondensed consolidated income statement\nBased on the related IFRS measure but excluding the adjusting items.

Property, plant and equipment\nDuring the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Group purchased assets at a cost of \u00a32.4m (H1 2024: \u00a32.1m and FY 2024: \u00a35.0m); including plant and equipment \u00a31.1m, tooling \u00a31.1m, construction in progress (\u00a30.7m), land and buildings \u00a30.5m and fixtures and fittings \u00a30.4m. Assets with a book value of \u00a30.1m were disposed of (H1 2024: \u00a30.1m and FY 2024 \u00a30.3m). Total depreciation for the period was \u00a32.2m (H1 2024: \u00a31.8m and FY 2024: \u00a33.8m).\nDuring the period there were lease additions totalling \u00a30.7m and a depreciation charge of \u00a31.5m. The net book value of right-of-use assets at 30 June 2025 was \u00a38.7m (30 June 2024: \u00a39.6m and 31 December 2024: \u00a39.7m).\nThe Group has not included any borrowing costs within additions in 2025 (2024: \u00a3nil). There were no funds specifically borrowed for the assets and the amount eligible as part of the general debt instruments pool (after applying the appropriate capitalisation rate) is not considered material.\n8. Intangible assets and goodwill\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and included in intangible assets when it meets the criteria laid out in IAS 38, \"Intangible Assets\". During the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Group incurred internally generated development costs of \u00a31.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.8m and FY 2024: \u00a31.9m). The Group has not included any borrowing costs within capitalised development costs. There were no funds specifically borrowed for this asset and the amount eligible as part of the general debt instruments pool (after applying the appropriate capitalisation rate) is not considered material. Amortisation for the six months ended 30 June 2025 was \u00a32.5m (H1 2024: \u00a31.6m and FY 2024: \u00a33.7m).\nIn the condensed consolidated income statement these amounts have been included within \"adjustments\" in calculating the Adjusted Operating Profit/loss (refer to note 1 in the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements).\nThere have been no triggers to necessitate an impairment of goodwill since the review undertaken as part of the year ended 31 December 2024. Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units and can be referred to in the Group's 2024 Annual Report and Accounts.\n9. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\nThis note provides information about the contractual terms of the Group's interest-bearing loans and borrowings, which are measured at amortised cost. For more information about the Group's exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, please refer to\u00a0note 20 in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts.\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nFY 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nNon-current liabilities\nRevolving credit facility\n75.1\n43.4\n70.5\nOverdrafts\n-\n-\n1.5\n75.1\n43.4\n72.0\nBank loans are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the Group.\n10.
