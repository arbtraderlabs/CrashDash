Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n9 July 2025\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\" or the \"Company\")\nH1 2025 Trading Update\nOn track to deliver full year results in line with Board expectations, including significant revenue growth\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN),\na foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform\n, provides the following unaudited update on trading for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (\"H1 2025\").\nThe Group expects to report an increase in revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2025 of approximately 16% to \u00a35.9m (H1 2024: \u00a35.1m), driven by an increase in active customers1 to 1,101 (H1 2024: 952). The Group expects to report a gross margin for H1 2025 of approximately 62% (H1 2024: 65.7%), which is due to revenue mix, and adjusted2\u00a0EBITDA of c.\u00a0\u00a30.3m (H1 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.8m), reflecting the investment in the Group's new strategic initiatives, which have substantially broadened the Group's capabilities and are expected to significantly accelerate sales growth and increase profitability in the medium term.\nBy client type, there was an increase in revenue generated by both private clients (primarily high net worth individuals) and corporate accounts in H1 2025. The proportion of total revenue accounted for by private clients was 42% (H1 2024: 60%) with corporate accounts contributing 58% (H1 2024: 38%).\nNew customers onboarded to the Finseta platform in H1 2025 but yet to transact were significantly higher than the first half of the prior year, and ahead of management's expectations, positioning the Group for further growth. The conversion of newly onboarded customers to active customers during the period was constrained by the effects on foreign exchange (\"FX\") rates and the global economy of tariff-related developments during H1 2025. A large proportion of the Group's customer base typically use Finseta's services for high-value purchases such as international real estate, and the Group saw some payment transactions being delayed until H2 2025. The Group expects these transactions will resume in the second half of the year as FX rates normalise and customers complete their underlying transactions.\nThe Group's new strategic initiatives - namely its corporate card scheme and operations in Canada and Dubai - commenced in H1 2025, generating first revenues during the period; revenues are expected to increase from these initiatives as the second half of the year progresses. In Dubai, following authorisation from the\u00a0Dubai Financial Services Authority to provide payment services within the\u00a0United Arab Emirates, the Group commenced the expansion of its operations, which will continue through H2 2025, including hiring a number of new salespeople.\nCash generated from operating activities in H1 2025 was c.\u00a0\u00a30.3m\u00a0(H1 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.8m). Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2025 were \u00a32.4m (31 December 2024:\u00a0\u00a32.6m) resulting in net cash3\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a30.4m\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.6m).\nLooking ahead, the Board expects that the Group will deliver a strong second half of the year and report results for FY 2025 in line with its expectations. The Board expects significant H2 2025 revenue growth consistent with previous years, at an improved gross margin compared to H1 2025, supported by anticipated transactions from the encouraging new customer onboarding activity in H1 2025 as markets normalise and from on-going growth from the Group's strategic initiatives.\nThe Group will provide further information in its interim results announcement, which is expected to be published in September 2025.\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"This has been a milestone period for Finseta as we launched our corporate card scheme and significantly expanded our international capabilities with full-service offerings in Dubai and Canada. While the global economic conditions resulted in customers delaying transactions, our strong levels of customer acquisition means we are well-positioned as markets normalise in H2. As a result, and with our new strategic initiatives set to ramp-up in H2, we remain on track to deliver significant revenue growth for FY 2025 and look to the future with great confidence.\"\nNotes\n1\nDefined as customers who traded through Finseta during the six-month periods to 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 respectively\n2\nAdjusted to exclude other operating income, share-based compensation, profit from the disposal of a subsidiary and transaction costs (in H1 2024), and the rental cost of the Group's corporate premises\n3\nDefined as cash and cash equivalents less loan notes\nEnquiries\nFinseta plc\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nDaniel Bush, Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Claire Norbury, Henry Gamble\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchange and payments company offering multi-currency accounts and payment solutions to businesses and individuals.

Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n9 July 2024\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nH1 2024 Trading Update\nStrong H1 2024 performance and on track to report significant growth for FY 2024\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN),\na foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform\n, is pleased to provide an unaudited update on trading for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (\"H1 2024\").\nH1 2024 Highlights\n\u00b7\nRevenue increased by c. 42% to c. \u00a35.1m (H1 2023: \u00a33.6m)\n\u00b7\nGrowth in active customers1\u00a0to 952 (H1 2023: 874) and increase in average transaction value\n\u00b7\nGross margin improved to c. 65% (H1 2023: 61.0%)\n\u00b7\nAdj. EBITDA\n2\nincreased by c. 300% to c. \u00a30.8m (H1 2023: \u00a30.2m)\n\u00b7\nCashflow generated from operations of c. \u00a30.7m (H1 2023: \u00a30.1m)\n\u00b7\nStrong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2024 of \u00a32.8m (31 December 2023: \u00a32.3m)\n\u00b7\nOn track to report significant revenue growth for full year 2024 in line with the Board's expectations\nAs noted in the Group's full year results announcement on 8 May 2024, the strong trading momentum that was experienced in 2023 had been sustained into the current year, and this continued through H1 2024. As a result, the Group expects to report an increase in revenue for H1 2024 of approximately 42%, to \u00a35.1m (H1 2023: \u00a33.6m). This significant growth was driven by an increase in active customers to 952 (H1 2023: 874) as well as an increase in average transaction value, reflecting the Group's expansion of its sales team and introducer network and an increased focus on providing an exceptional level of service to its corporate and high net worth individual (\"HNWI\") clients.\nThe Group expects to report an improvement in gross margin to c. 65% for H1 2024 (H1 2023: 61.0%). This is primarily due to the Group no longer deriving revenue from white label partners following its strategic decision to manage down its historic white label business. On an underlying basis, to exclude revenue generated by white label partners in H1 2023, the Group's revenue grew by c. 54% in H1 2024 over H1 2023. Revenue by client type remained stable, with HNWI customers accounting for 61% and corporate customers for 39% (H1 2023: 62% and 38%, respectively).\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be c. \u00a30.8m for the first half of 2014 (H1 2023: \u00a30.2m). This growth reflects the increase in revenue as well as the Group beginning to benefit from the operating leverage offered by its highly scalable platform. Cashflow generated from operations was c. \u00a30.7m (H1 2023: \u00a30.1m), with the Group generating a total net cash inflow of c. \u00a30.4m for the H1 2024 period (H1 2023: \u00a30.1m). Accordingly, cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2024 increased to \u00a32.8m (31 December 2023: \u00a32.3m).\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"This has been another excellent period of delivery for Finseta, with substantial growth in revenue and EBTIDA as we continued to increase our number of customers and average transaction value. This reflects our success in executing on our strategy to expand our introducer network and payments capabilities while maintaining the high level of customer service for which we are known. Alongside this, we continued to strengthen our business and drivers of future growth with the important progress made in establishing a presence in Canada and with our card programme. Accordingly, and with the strong trading momentum being sustained, we remain on track to deliver significant growth for FY 2024 in line with the Board's expectations and look to the future with great confidence.\n\"\nThe Group will provide further information on its H1 2024 performance in its interim results announcement, which is scheduled to be published on 10 September 2024.\n1\nDefined as customers who traded through Finseta during the 12-month periods to 30 June 2024 and 2023 respectively\n2\nAdjusted to exclude share-based compensation, transaction costs, depreciation & amortisation charges, profit from the disposal of a subsidiary, other operating income related to interest on client balances and non-cash based accounting adjustments in respect of the Group's corporate premises\nFor further information, please contact:\nFinseta plc\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nDaniel Bush / Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\nHarry Chathli / Claire Norbury\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchange and payments company offering multi-currency accounts and payment solutions to businesses and individuals.
