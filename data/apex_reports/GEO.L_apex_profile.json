This includes payment of the A$100,000 cash consideration and the issuance of 48,130,000 GEO ordinary shares at a price of \u00a30.004 per share, in accordance with the terms announced on 21 October 2025.\nThe consideration shares have been issued and are subject to escrow arrangements with the Company's share registrar until 13 January 2027.\nThe exploration licence will appear on the Western Australian DMIRS public register following completion of the standard regulatory application processing.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Gorge Project, the Company has agreed to issue 18,472,037 new ordinary shares to Mr Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee at an issue price of \u00a30.00135 which is the closing share price on 12 January 2026. The consultancy fee represents A$50,000. Mr Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in relation to the identification, evaluation and progression of the Gorge Project through to completion.\nGorge Project Overview\nThe Gorge Project comprises granted Exploration Licence E08/3737, located approximately 110km west of Paraburdoo in Western Australia and covering an area of 81 square kilometres within the Capricorn Orogen.\nHistoric exploration at Gorge has been limited and sporadic, however previous work has identified widespread gold mineralisation across the licence area. Gold occurrences have been recorded over approximately 5km of strike, supported by drainage, soil and rock chip sampling, historic workings, and alluvial and eluvial gold recovery.\nHistorical results include:\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples returning gold values up to 134g/t Au\n\u00b7\nSoil samples returning gold values up to 233g/t Au\n\u00b7\nDrainage sampling returning elevated gold values\n\u00b7\nRecovery of multiple gold nuggets from near surface, ranging from <2g to in excess of 100g\nThese results along with the proximity of the nugget recoveries suggests the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source within the licence area. Further details of historic activities and results can be found in the announcement dated 11 December 2025 - Gorge Project Update.\nExploration Activities\nWith the acquisition now completed, the Company is preparing systematic exploration activities at the Gorge Project. Planned work programmes will focus on modern exploration techniques designed to refine priority target areas and advance the project toward initial drilling following completion of required heritage and access activities.\nNamibia Update\nGEO has a material opportunity to deliver shareholder value from its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin, offshore NW Namibia. This licence covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths ranging from 450 metres to 1550 metres. In May 2025, GEO reported a material uplift in the gross mean prospective resources across the licence area to c.4.31billion barrels.\nGEO's strategy is to secure a farm-out partner to fund and lead the next stages of exploration and development. Since the Company reported that it was in advanced discussions in late 2024, several new parties have accessed the data room. The Directors believe that activity with Chevron and others across the region has reinvigorated interest in PEL0094, particularly since October 2025. As a result, the Company remains in discussions with the interested party reported in 2024 pending fulfilment of certain financial conditions by that party. However, given the time elapsed since 31 December 2024 and the recent increased interest in the licence from new parties, it seems likely that the terms with original interested party would be amended if an agreement is formalised with that party. The Company will continue to update shareholders as progress is made towards a farm-out agreement.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to AIM for admission of the Consideration Shares (the \"New Ordinary Shares\"), which will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares. Admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the New Ordinary Shares to commence, on or around 8.00 a.m. on 19 January 2026.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 5,663,107,159 Ordinary Shares, each carrying one vote per share. Accordingly, the figure of 5,663,107,159 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for calculations by which they determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nOmar Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"With the final administrative steps now completed, we are pleased to be in a position to begin exploration at the Gorge Project. The historic grades, widespread surface gold occurrences and recovery of multiple gold nuggets highlight the prospectivity of the licence and support further systematic exploration and future drilling.\nIn parallel, we are encouraged by the level of interest in our Namibian licence and determined to secure an accretive farm-out agreement for shareholders.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

This includes payment of the A$100,000 cash consideration and the issuance of 48,130,000 GEO ordinary shares at a price of \u00a30.004 per share, in accordance with the terms announced on 21 October 2025.\nThe consideration shares have been issued and are subject to escrow arrangements with the Company's share registrar until 13 January 2027.\nThe exploration licence will appear on the Western Australian DMIRS public register following completion of the standard regulatory application processing.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Gorge Project, the Company has agreed to issue 18,472,037 new ordinary shares to Mr Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee at an issue price of \u00a30.00135 which is the closing share price on 12 January 2026. The consultancy fee represents A$50,000. Mr Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in relation to the identification, evaluation and progression of the Gorge Project through to completion.\nGorge Project Overview\nThe Gorge Project comprises granted Exploration Licence E08/3737, located approximately 110km west of Paraburdoo in Western Australia and covering an area of 81 square kilometres within the Capricorn Orogen.\nHistoric exploration at Gorge has been limited and sporadic, however previous work has identified widespread gold mineralisation across the licence area. Gold occurrences have been recorded over approximately 5km of strike, supported by drainage, soil and rock chip sampling, historic workings, and alluvial and eluvial gold recovery.\nHistorical results include:\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples returning gold values up to 134g/t Au\n\u00b7\nSoil samples returning gold values up to 233g/t Au\n\u00b7\nDrainage sampling returning elevated gold values\n\u00b7\nRecovery of multiple gold nuggets from near surface, ranging from <2g to in excess of 100g\nThese results along with the proximity of the nugget recoveries suggests the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source within the licence area. Further details of historic activities and results can be found in the announcement dated 11 December 2025 - Gorge Project Update.\nExploration Activities\nWith the acquisition now completed, the Company is preparing systematic exploration activities at the Gorge Project. Planned work programmes will focus on modern exploration techniques designed to refine priority target areas and advance the project toward initial drilling following completion of required heritage and access activities.\nNamibia Update\nGEO has a material opportunity to deliver shareholder value from its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin, offshore NW Namibia. This licence covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths ranging from 450 metres to 1550 metres. In May 2025, GEO reported a material uplift in the gross mean prospective resources across the licence area to c.4.31MMbbl.\nGEO's strategy is to secure a farm-out partner to fund and lead the next stages of exploration and development. Since the Company reported that it was in advanced discussions in late 2024, several new parties have accessed the data room. The Directors believe that activity with Chevron and others across the region has reinvigorated interest in PEL0094, particularly since October 2025. As a result, the Company remains in discussions with the interested party reported in 2024 pending fulfilment of certain financial conditions by that party. However, given the time elapsed since 31 December 2024 and the recent increased interest in the licence from new parties, it seems likely that the terms with original interested party would be amended if an agreement is formalised with that party. The Company will continue to update shareholders as progress is made towards a farm-out agreement.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to AIM for admission of the Consideration Shares (the \"New Ordinary Shares\"), which will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares. Admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the New Ordinary Shares to commence, on or around 8.00 a.m. on 19 January 2026.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 5,663,107,159 Ordinary Shares, each carrying one vote per share. Accordingly, the figure of 5,663,107,159 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for calculations by which they determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nOmar Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"With the final administrative steps now completed, we are pleased to be in a position to begin exploration at the Gorge Project. The historic grades, widespread surface gold occurrences and recovery of multiple gold nuggets highlight the prospectivity of the licence and support further systematic exploration and future drilling.\nIn parallel, we are encouraged by the level of interest in our Namibian licence and determined to secure an accretive farm-out agreement for shareholders.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

Results confirm mineralisation intersected in drillholes JUD001 and JUD002 with low tenor precious and base metals returned from laboratory analysis.\nSummary\n\u00b7\nMaiden drill holes JUD001 and JUD002 at the Juno Project successfully intersected the targeted geological sequences and confirmed the presence of mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nGold and copper sulphide mineralisation, together with silver and zinc, was intersected in both drillholes JUD001 and JUD002.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may represent a peripheral position within a larger mineral system.\n\u00b7\nInitial interpretation suggests the system may hold higher grade mineralisation approximately 500m metres southeast of JUD001 and 2km southwest of JUD001.\n\u00b7\nThe Company believes exploration is a systematic, multi-programme learning process and further drilling is warranted to test for the presence of higher grade mineralisation within the large multi kilometre scale of the Juno geophysical target.\nThe Juno project located in central Western Australia where the company is conducting exploration activities and has recently completed its maiden drill programme for Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style deposits which host precious and base metal mineralisation. The project currently comprises four contiguous licences covering a total of 644 square kilometres. The licences contain several geophysical targets with similar features to other known IRGS style deposits elsewhere in Western Australia.\nThe Company carried out its maiden drilling programme at the Juno Project during September and October 2025. Safe and efficient progress was made during drilling activities, JUD001 and JUD002 advanced as planned, intersected the expected rock sequences, and achieved adequate depths to assess targets in the chosen drillhole locations.\nDrillhole JUD001 was vertical and drilled to a total depth of 810.6m, and JUD002 was vertical and drilled to a total depth of 774.7m. Drill hole collar details are presented in Table 1 and location are shown on Figure 1. Geology intersected was late Proterozoic shales and carbonates underlain by early Proterozoic carbonate rich metasediments. Depth to targeted basement was 246.7m in JUD001 and 262.0m in JUD002. Structural and metamorphic alteration of intersected rocks was apparent.\nTable 1 - Drill Hole Collar Details\nHole ID\nType\nDepth (m)\nDip\n(degrees)\nAzimuth (degrees)\nEast GDA94\nNorth GDA94\nRL (m)\nSurvey Method\nJUD001\nCore\n810.6\n-90\n360\n571737\n7346272\n357\nGPS\nJUD002\nCore\n774.7\n-90\n360\n572052\n7347015\n366\nGPS\nAnalytical work was carried out on JUD001 and JUD002 by Intertek Laboratories in Perth where each 1m core sample was analysed for a comprehensive multi-element suite of precious metals, base metals and pathfinder elements (49 elements).\nFigure 1 - Drill Hole Collar Locations\nGold and copper results were returned from targeted basement in JUD001 and JUD002. Silver and zinc results were returned from overlying rocks in holes JUD001 and JUD002.

In the targeted basement sequence low tenor gold and copper sulphide mineralisation was sporadically intercepted in the hole locations drilled. A photo of example mineralisation from JUD001 is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2 - Drill Core Photos\nConsidering the large multi kilometre scale of the modelled geophysical target at Juno the Company believes mineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may represent a peripheral portion of a larger system. Higher grade mineralisation may be present proximal to JUD001 and JUD002 and further review of analytical data with geological and geophysical information will be carried out.\nGold and copper mineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may indicate the potential presence of proximal higher-grade mineralisation. Initial interpretation suggests the system may hold higher grade mineralisation approximately 500m metres southeast of JUD001 and 2km southwest of JUD001 (Figure 1) which remain as valid targets as per 24 July 2025 RNS. Further review of data will be carried out and if other valid targets emerge then the Company may direct 2026 drilling efforts to other locations within the multi kilometre scale Juno geophysical target and updates will be provided to the market accordingly. The Company believes exploration is a systematic, multi-programme learning process and further drilling is warranted to test for the presence of higher-grade mineralisation within the large multi kilometre scale of the Juno geophysical target. Currently, additional drilling is scheduled for the earliest opportunity in 2026. The Company has now fulfilled its capital commitment, as outlined in the 14 August 2024 RNS, in respect of the initial Juno work programme, which brings to a close the maiden drill campaign.\nLaboratory assay results were received prior to quarter end; however, release was deferred to allow for independent review and sign-off by a suitably qualified Competent Person (\"CP\"), as required under the AIM Rules and the JORC Code. The Company considered it important that this review was undertaken by a high-quality CP with detailed knowledge of the project. Due to the CP's availability over the festive period, the review was completed in early January, following which the results were available for release.\nOmar Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"The maiden drilling programme has identified mineralisation at Juno. Shareholders should note that Juno is a large multi kilometre greenfield site and that the identification of mineralisation is a positive development that warrants further targeted drilling to test for potential higher-grade mineralisation. We will update shareholders accordingly as work on Juno Project progresses.\"\nCallum Baxter, GEO's JV Partner for Juno Project, commented:\n\"Analytical results from Juno drillholes JUD001 and JUD002 show sporadic, low grade gold and copper mineralisation has been intersected in the chosen hole locations. This may represent mineralisation proximal to higher grade mineralisation elsewhere within the broader area at Juno. Considering the multi-kilometre scale of the Juno target further assessment of geology and drill targets will be undertaken.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

Today's Issue Price represents a 21.7% discount to the closing bid price of 0.23 pence per share on 15 December 2025.\nThe Fundraise was met with strong demand from investors reflecting growing confidence in the Company's strategy and technical progress. Investor support follows the successful completion of GEO's maiden drilling programme at the Juno Project and recent encouraging exploration developments at the Gorge Project, which together mark important milestones as the Company advances its exploration portfolio across Australia.\nThe net proceeds of the Fundraise will be applied towards ongoing and planned exploration activities at the Gorge Project, funding a follow-on drilling campaign at the Juno Project anticipated in early 2026, providing sufficient working capital to support the Company's expanding operational and corporate requirements, and capitalising on opportunities at PEL 94 (Namibia), including potential farm-out and related transaction costs, particularly in light of increased industry activity in Namibia.\nCMC Markets UK plc, trading as CMC CapX, acted as the Company's sole placing agent.\nHamza Choudhry, Chief Financial Officer of GEO Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by the strong support from investors in this fundraise, which reflects growing confidence in the progress the Company has made across its portfolio and the opportunity ahead.\nThe Company is entering an exciting phase at the Juno Project with results pending from the labs, alongside increasingly encouraging exploration signals at the Gorge Project, including high-grade rock chips and the recovery of large gold nuggets. In parallel, heightened industry interest in Namibia's Walvis Basin following recent offshore developments with Chevron announcing future drills has further sharpened focus on PEL 94.\nWith a strengthened balance sheet, GEO is well positioned to continue advancing its assets in a disciplined manner, grow the business through technical progress across multiple projects, and pursue opportunities that we believe can deliver long-term value for shareholders.\nAs always, we thank all new and existing shareholders for their support as we look forward to taking them with us on the journey ahead.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to AIM for admission of the Placing Shares (the \"New Ordinary Shares\"), which will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares. Admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the New Ordinary Shares to commence, on or around 8.00 a.m. on 22 December 2025.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 5,596,505,122 Ordinary Shares, each carrying one vote per share. Accordingly, the figure of 5,596,505,122 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for calculations by which they determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").
