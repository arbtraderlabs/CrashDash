          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 9747R\nGeo Exploration Limited\n06 February 2026\n06 February 2026\nGEO Exploration Limited\n(\"GEO \" or the \"Company\")\nDirector Equity Remuneration, Warrant Extension\nand Option Awards Related Party Transactions\nGEO Exploration Limited (AIM: GEO) announces that the Board has approved a number of equity-based remuneration and incentive arrangements in accordance with the Company's existing contractual obligations and long-term incentive framework.\nThe approvals form part of a single, integrated remuneration and incentive package approved by the Board, comprising the settlement of agreed director remuneration in shares, the grant of share options and the extension of certain warrant terms. The Board believes that the use of equity-based remuneration is appropriate for the Company and supports long-term alignment between management and shareholders.\nIssue of Shares - Director Remuneration\nAt the time of the appointments of Omar Ahmad, Hamza Choudhry and Azib Khan as Executive Directors, their remuneration was agreed in the form of cash and shares. As announced on 5 December 2024, Brian Chu receives 20% of his Non-Executive Director fees in shares. However, as the Company had unpublished inside information the award of shares had to be deferred. Accordingly, the Company has now issued new ordinary shares as follows:\n\u00b7\n54,975,000 ordinary shares to Azib Khan, representing unpaid fees from 2024, which Mr Khan has agreed to receive as stock in lieu of cash, with an aggregate value of \u00a376,965, calculated at the market price on 16 January 2026. These fees were accrued within the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2025.\n\u00b7\n46,100,000 ordinary shares each (being 138,300,000 ordinary shares in aggregate) to Hamza Choudhry, Omar Ahmad and Azib Khan, issued to the executive directors and accepted prudently in lieu of cash remuneration, consistent with the directors' long-term alignment with shareholders; and\n\u00b7\n3,062,832 ordinary shares to Brian Chu in satisfaction of contractual remuneration relating to his role as Non-Executive Director. As announced on 5 December 2024, Brian Chu receives 20% of his Non-Executive Director fees in shares. The number of shares is based on the 5-day VWAP at each quarter end as follows:\nQuarter End\n5-Day VWAP\nNumber of Shares\n31 December 2024\n0.298p\n116,308\n31 March 2025\n0.124p\n982,816\n30 June 2025\n0.128p\n931,702\n30 September 2025\n0.358p\n684,679\n31 December 2025\n0.180p\n1,379,331\nThe Board notes that, at the time of appointment, the relevant directors elected to receive equity in lieu of cash remuneration, having regard to the Company's circumstances at that time, including its stage of development, capital priorities and liquidity considerations. The Board considers that this approach appropriately aligned the directors with shareholders from the outset, preserved cash resources for operational and strategic purposes, and was consistent with market practice for AIM-listed companies at a comparable stage.\nAll new ordinary shares will rank pari passu with the Company's existing ordinary shares.\nExtension of Warrants from August 2023 Capital Raise\nThe Board has approved an extension to the expiry date of warrants awarded as part of the Company's placing completed in August 2023. The expiry date of all remaining warrants has been extended by 36 months to 6 September 2029, on otherwise unchanged terms.\nTwo Directors, Omar Ahmad and Hamza Choudhry, hold approximately 79% of the remaining outstanding warrants and are therefore related parties under the AIM Rules. The Directors believe that this will benefit the Company by incentivising the relevant directors to continue to drive the Company's projects forward for the benefit of all shareholders and will, when exercised, provide funds for the Company.\nWarrant holder\nNumber\nExercise Price\nRevised Expiry\nOmar Ahmad\n150,000,000\n0.1p\n6 September 2026\nHamza Choudhry\n40,000,000\n0.1p\n6 September 2026\nMichael Joseph\n50,000,000\n0.1p\n6 September 2026\nTotal\n240,000,000\nAll of the warrant holders have given their consent to this change in accordance with the terms of these instruments.\nShare Option Awards - Summary of Terms\nIn order to continue to retain and incentivise the services of the Directors, and to align their interests with those of the Company and its shareholders, the Board has approved the following awards of options to subscribe for new ordinary shares:\nName\nNumber\nExercise Price\nDate Appointed\nOmar Ahmad\u00a0(CEO)\n150,000,000\n0.1211p\n5 September 2024\nHamza Choudhry (CFO)\n150,000,000\n0.1211p\n5 September 2024\nAzib Khan (CCO)\n150,000,000\n0.1211p\n5 December 2024\nBrian Chu\u00a0(NED)\n40,000,000\n0.1211p\n3 December 2024\nTotal\n490,000,000\nThere are 110,000,000 options already in issue: 50,000,000 held by Azib Khan and the remaining 60,000,000 held by employees and former directors. The existing options and proposed options held by current directors will represent c.10% of the issued share capital.\nAll options are to have an expiry of 10 years from the Date of Issuance, with an exercise price of 0.1211p. The exercise price represents a 26% discount to the VWAP for the 7 trading days ended 31 January 2025 (being the first anniversary of the previous award to Azib), a 50% premium to the 7-day VWAP ended 17 September 2024 (being the date Omar and Hamza were appointed as directors) and a c.7% discount to the current share price (c.0.13p).\nThe options are subject to the following performance and time-based vesting conditions:\n(a) 15% of options vest if the 1-month VWAP reaches 0.2422p, being 2 times the exercise price, or more at any time within 2 years from the Date of Appointment;\n(b) 15% of options vest if the 1-month VWAP reaches 0.3633p, being 3 times the exercise price, or more at any time within 2 years from the Date of Appointment;\n(c) 20% of options issued vest on the first anniversary of the Date of Appointment, subject to continued employment;\n(d) 20% of options issued vest on the second anniversary of the Date of Appointment, subject to continued employment;\n(e) 15% of options issued vest on the third anniversary of the Date of Appointment, subject to continued employment; and\n(f) 15% of options issued vest on the fourth anniversary of the Date of Appointment, subject to continued employment.\nFor the purposes of the above, \"1-month VWAP\" means the volume weighted average price of the Company's ordinary shares over the 20 trading days immediately preceding the relevant test date.\nWithin each tranche of options, once the vesting criteria is achieved, 50% may be exercised immediately and the remaining 50% may be exercised from the date 3 months following vesting.\nThe vesting of all options is conditional upon the option holder remaining engaged, employed or appointed by the Company at the relevant vesting date and typical good leaver/bad leaver provisions.\nIn relation to the award of options to non-executive directors, such as Brian Chu, there is some debate as to whether an interest in the shares can impugn their independence, chiefly amongst regulators and proxy advisers. However, market practice for smaller companies is making such awards more common providing they are at a relatively minimal level on the basis that such smaller companies need to attract and retain senior NEDs that they could not otherwise afford.\nIn this instance, the award has a total exercise value of \u00a348,440.

This includes payment of the A$100,000 cash consideration and the issuance of 48,130,000 GEO ordinary shares at a price of \u00a30.004 per share, in accordance with the terms announced on 21 October 2025.\nThe consideration shares have been issued and are subject to escrow arrangements with the Company's share registrar until 13 January 2027.\nThe exploration licence will appear on the Western Australian DMIRS public register following completion of the standard regulatory application processing.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Gorge Project, the Company has agreed to issue 18,472,037 new ordinary shares to Mr Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee at an issue price of \u00a30.00135 which is the closing share price on 12 January 2026. The consultancy fee represents A$50,000. Mr Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in relation to the identification, evaluation and progression of the Gorge Project through to completion.\nGorge Project Overview\nThe Gorge Project comprises granted Exploration Licence E08/3737, located approximately 110km west of Paraburdoo in Western Australia and covering an area of 81 square kilometres within the Capricorn Orogen.\nHistoric exploration at Gorge has been limited and sporadic, however previous work has identified widespread gold mineralisation across the licence area. Gold occurrences have been recorded over approximately 5km of strike, supported by drainage, soil and rock chip sampling, historic workings, and alluvial and eluvial gold recovery.\nHistorical results include:\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples returning gold values up to 134g/t Au\n\u00b7\nSoil samples returning gold values up to 233g/t Au\n\u00b7\nDrainage sampling returning elevated gold values\n\u00b7\nRecovery of multiple gold nuggets from near surface, ranging from <2g to in excess of 100g\nThese results along with the proximity of the nugget recoveries suggests the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source within the licence area. Further details of historic activities and results can be found in the announcement dated 11 December 2025 - Gorge Project Update.\nExploration Activities\nWith the acquisition now completed, the Company is preparing systematic exploration activities at the Gorge Project. Planned work programmes will focus on modern exploration techniques designed to refine priority target areas and advance the project toward initial drilling following completion of required heritage and access activities.\nNamibia Update\nGEO has a material opportunity to deliver shareholder value from its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin, offshore NW Namibia. This licence covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths ranging from 450 metres to 1550 metres. In May 2025, GEO reported a material uplift in the gross mean prospective resources across the licence area to c.4.31billion barrels.\nGEO's strategy is to secure a farm-out partner to fund and lead the next stages of exploration and development. Since the Company reported that it was in advanced discussions in late 2024, several new parties have accessed the data room. The Directors believe that activity with Chevron and others across the region has reinvigorated interest in PEL0094, particularly since October 2025. As a result, the Company remains in discussions with the interested party reported in 2024 pending fulfilment of certain financial conditions by that party. However, given the time elapsed since 31 December 2024 and the recent increased interest in the licence from new parties, it seems likely that the terms with original interested party would be amended if an agreement is formalised with that party. The Company will continue to update shareholders as progress is made towards a farm-out agreement.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to AIM for admission of the Consideration Shares (the \"New Ordinary Shares\"), which will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares. Admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the New Ordinary Shares to commence, on or around 8.00 a.m. on 19 January 2026.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 5,663,107,159 Ordinary Shares, each carrying one vote per share. Accordingly, the figure of 5,663,107,159 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for calculations by which they determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nOmar Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"With the final administrative steps now completed, we are pleased to be in a position to begin exploration at the Gorge Project. The historic grades, widespread surface gold occurrences and recovery of multiple gold nuggets highlight the prospectivity of the licence and support further systematic exploration and future drilling.\nIn parallel, we are encouraged by the level of interest in our Namibian licence and determined to secure an accretive farm-out agreement for shareholders.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

Results confirm mineralisation intersected in drillholes JUD001 and JUD002 with low tenor precious and base metals returned from laboratory analysis.\nSummary\n\u00b7\nMaiden drill holes JUD001 and JUD002 at the Juno Project successfully intersected the targeted geological sequences and confirmed the presence of mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nGold and copper sulphide mineralisation, together with silver and zinc, was intersected in both drillholes JUD001 and JUD002.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may represent a peripheral position within a larger mineral system.\n\u00b7\nInitial interpretation suggests the system may hold higher grade mineralisation approximately 500m metres southeast of JUD001 and 2km southwest of JUD001.\n\u00b7\nThe Company believes exploration is a systematic, multi-programme learning process and further drilling is warranted to test for the presence of higher grade mineralisation within the large multi kilometre scale of the Juno geophysical target.\nThe Juno project located in central Western Australia where the company is conducting exploration activities and has recently completed its maiden drill programme for Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style deposits which host precious and base metal mineralisation. The project currently comprises four contiguous licences covering a total of 644 square kilometres. The licences contain several geophysical targets with similar features to other known IRGS style deposits elsewhere in Western Australia.\nThe Company carried out its maiden drilling programme at the Juno Project during September and October 2025. Safe and efficient progress was made during drilling activities, JUD001 and JUD002 advanced as planned, intersected the expected rock sequences, and achieved adequate depths to assess targets in the chosen drillhole locations.\nDrillhole JUD001 was vertical and drilled to a total depth of 810.6m, and JUD002 was vertical and drilled to a total depth of 774.7m. Drill hole collar details are presented in Table 1 and location are shown on Figure 1. Geology intersected was late Proterozoic shales and carbonates underlain by early Proterozoic carbonate rich metasediments. Depth to targeted basement was 246.7m in JUD001 and 262.0m in JUD002. Structural and metamorphic alteration of intersected rocks was apparent.\nTable 1 - Drill Hole Collar Details\nHole ID\nType\nDepth (m)\nDip\n(degrees)\nAzimuth (degrees)\nEast GDA94\nNorth GDA94\nRL (m)\nSurvey Method\nJUD001\nCore\n810.6\n-90\n360\n571737\n7346272\n357\nGPS\nJUD002\nCore\n774.7\n-90\n360\n572052\n7347015\n366\nGPS\nAnalytical work was carried out on JUD001 and JUD002 by Intertek Laboratories in Perth where each 1m core sample was analysed for a comprehensive multi-element suite of precious metals, base metals and pathfinder elements (49 elements).\nFigure 1 - Drill Hole Collar Locations\nGold and copper results were returned from targeted basement in JUD001 and JUD002.

In the targeted basement sequence low tenor gold and copper sulphide mineralisation was sporadically intercepted in the hole locations drilled. A photo of example mineralisation from JUD001 is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2 - Drill Core Photos\nConsidering the large multi kilometre scale of the modelled geophysical target at Juno the Company believes mineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may represent a peripheral portion of a larger system. Higher grade mineralisation may be present proximal to JUD001 and JUD002 and further review of analytical data with geological and geophysical information will be carried out.\nGold and copper mineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may indicate the potential presence of proximal higher-grade mineralisation. Initial interpretation suggests the system may hold higher grade mineralisation approximately 500m metres southeast of JUD001 and 2km southwest of JUD001 (Figure 1) which remain as valid targets as per 24 July 2025 RNS. Further review of data will be carried out and if other valid targets emerge then the Company may direct 2026 drilling efforts to other locations within the multi kilometre scale Juno geophysical target and updates will be provided to the market accordingly. The Company believes exploration is a systematic, multi-programme learning process and further drilling is warranted to test for the presence of higher-grade mineralisation within the large multi kilometre scale of the Juno geophysical target. Currently, additional drilling is scheduled for the earliest opportunity in 2026. The Company has now fulfilled its capital commitment, as outlined in the 14 August 2024 RNS, in respect of the initial Juno work programme, which brings to a close the maiden drill campaign.\nLaboratory assay results were received prior to quarter end; however, release was deferred to allow for independent review and sign-off by a suitably qualified Competent Person (\"CP\"), as required under the AIM Rules and the JORC Code. The Company considered it important that this review was undertaken by a high-quality CP with detailed knowledge of the project. Due to the CP's availability over the festive period, the review was completed in early January, following which the results were available for release.\nOmar Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"The maiden drilling programme has identified mineralisation at Juno. Shareholders should note that Juno is a large multi kilometre greenfield site and that the identification of mineralisation is a positive development that warrants further targeted drilling to test for potential higher-grade mineralisation. We will update shareholders accordingly as work on Juno Project progresses.\"\nCallum Baxter, GEO's JV Partner for Juno Project, commented:\n\"Analytical results from Juno drillholes JUD001 and JUD002 show sporadic, low grade gold and copper mineralisation has been intersected in the chosen hole locations.

This includes payment of the A$100,000 cash consideration and the issuance of 48,130,000 GEO ordinary shares at a price of \u00a30.004 per share, in accordance with the terms announced on 21 October 2025.\nThe consideration shares have been issued and are subject to escrow arrangements with the Company's share registrar until 13 January 2027.\nThe exploration licence will appear on the Western Australian DMIRS public register following completion of the standard regulatory application processing.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Gorge Project, the Company has agreed to issue 18,472,037 new ordinary shares to Mr Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee at an issue price of \u00a30.00135 which is the closing share price on 12 January 2026. The consultancy fee represents A$50,000. Mr Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in relation to the identification, evaluation and progression of the Gorge Project through to completion.\nGorge Project Overview\nThe Gorge Project comprises granted Exploration Licence E08/3737, located approximately 110km west of Paraburdoo in Western Australia and covering an area of 81 square kilometres within the Capricorn Orogen.\nHistoric exploration at Gorge has been limited and sporadic, however previous work has identified widespread gold mineralisation across the licence area. Gold occurrences have been recorded over approximately 5km of strike, supported by drainage, soil and rock chip sampling, historic workings, and alluvial and eluvial gold recovery.\nHistorical results include:\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples returning gold values up to 134g/t Au\n\u00b7\nSoil samples returning gold values up to 233g/t Au\n\u00b7\nDrainage sampling returning elevated gold values\n\u00b7\nRecovery of multiple gold nuggets from near surface, ranging from <2g to in excess of 100g\nThese results along with the proximity of the nugget recoveries suggests the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source within the licence area. Further details of historic activities and results can be found in the announcement dated 11 December 2025 - Gorge Project Update.\nExploration Activities\nWith the acquisition now completed, the Company is preparing systematic exploration activities at the Gorge Project. Planned work programmes will focus on modern exploration techniques designed to refine priority target areas and advance the project toward initial drilling following completion of required heritage and access activities.\nNamibia Update\nGEO has a material opportunity to deliver shareholder value from its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin, offshore NW Namibia. This licence covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths ranging from 450 metres to 1550 metres. In May 2025, GEO reported a material uplift in the gross mean prospective resources across the licence area to c.4.31billion barrels.\nGEO's strategy is to secure a farm-out partner to fund and lead the next stages of exploration and development. Since the Company reported that it was in advanced discussions in late 2024, several new parties have accessed the data room. The Directors believe that activity with Chevron and others across the region has reinvigorated interest in PEL0094, particularly since October 2025. As a result, the Company remains in discussions with the interested part",

This includes payment of the A$100,000 cash consideration and the issuance of 48,130,000 GEO ordinary shares at a price of \u00a30.004 per share, in accordance with the terms announced on 21 October 2025.\nThe consideration shares have been issued and are subject to escrow arrangements with the Company's share registrar until 13 January 2027.\nThe exploration licence will appear on the Western Australian DMIRS public register following completion of the standard regulatory application processing.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Gorge Project, the Company has agreed to issue 18,472,037 new ordinary shares to Mr Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee at an issue price of \u00a30.00135 which is the closing share price on 12 January 2026. The consultancy fee represents A$50,000. Mr Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in relation to the identification, evaluation and progression of the Gorge Project through to completion.\nGorge Project Overview\nThe Gorge Project comprises granted Exploration Licence E08/3737, located approximately 110km west of Paraburdoo in Western Australia and covering an area of 81 square kilometres within the Capricorn Orogen.\nHistoric exploration at Gorge has been limited and sporadic, however previous work has identified widespread gold mineralisation across the licence area. Gold occurrences have been recorded over approximately 5km of strike, supported by drainage, soil and rock chip sampling, historic workings, and alluvial and eluvial gold recovery.\nHistorical results include:\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples returning gold values up to 134g/t Au\n\u00b7\nSoil samples returning gold values up to 233g/t Au\n\u00b7\nDrainage sampling returning elevated gold values\n\u00b7\nRecovery of multiple gold nuggets from near surface, ranging from <2g to in excess of 100g\nThese results along with the proximity of the nugget recoveries suggests the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source within the licence area. Further details of historic activities and results can be found in the announcement dated 11 December 2025 - Gorge Project Update.\nExploration Activities\nWith the acquisition now completed, the Company is preparing systematic exploration activities at the Gorge Project. Planned work programmes will focus on modern exploration techniques designed to refine priority target areas and advance the project toward initial drilling following completion of required heritage and access activities.\nNamibia Update\nGEO has a material opportunity to deliver shareholder value from its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin, offshore NW Namibia. This licence covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths ranging from 450 metres to 1550 metres. In May 2025, GEO reported a material uplift in the gross mean prospective resources across the licence area to c.4.31MMbbl.\nGEO's strategy is to secure a farm-out partner to fund and lead the next stages of exploration and development. Since the Company reported that it was in advanced discussions in late 2024, several new parties have accessed the data room. The Directors believe that activity with Chevron and others across the region has reinvigorated interest in PEL0094, particularly since October 2025. As a result, the Company remains in discussions with the interested party reported",

Results confirm mineralisation intersected in drillholes JUD001 and JUD002 with low tenor precious and base metals returned from laboratory analysis.\nSummary\n\u00b7\nMaiden drill holes JUD001 and JUD002 at the Juno Project successfully intersected the targeted geological sequences and confirmed the presence of mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nGold and copper sulphide mineralisation, together with silver and zinc, was intersected in both drillholes JUD001 and JUD002.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation intersected in JUD001 and JUD002 may represent a peripheral position within a larger mineral system.\n\u00b7\nInitial interpretation suggests the system may hold higher grade mineralisation approximately 500m metres southeast of JUD001 and 2km southwest of JUD001.\n\u00b7\nThe Company believes exploration is a systematic, multi-programme learning process and further drilling is warranted to test for the presence of higher grade mineralisation within the large multi kilometre scale of the Juno geophysical target.\nThe Juno project located in central Western Australia where the company is conducting exploration activities and has recently completed its maiden drill programme for Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style deposits which host precious and base metal mineralisation. The project currently comprises four contiguous licences covering a total of 644 square kilometres. The licences contain several geophysical targets with similar features to other known IRGS style deposits elsewhere in Western Australia.\nThe Company carried out its maiden drilling programme at the Juno Project during September and October 2025. Safe and efficient progress was made during drilling activities, JUD001 and JUD002 advanced as planned, intersected the expected rock sequences, and achieved adequate depths to assess targets in the chosen drillhole locations.\nDrillhole JUD001 was vertical and drilled to a total depth of 810.6m, and JUD002 was vertical and drilled to a total depth of 774.7m. Drill hole collar details are presented in Table 1 and location are shown on Figure 1. Geology intersected was late Proterozoic shales and carbonates underlain by early Proterozoic carbonate rich metasediments. Depth to targeted basement was 246.7m in JUD001 and 262.0m in JUD002. Structural and metamorphic alteration of intersected rocks was apparent.\nTable 1 - Drill Hole Collar Details\nHole ID\nType\nDepth (m)\nDip\n(degrees)\nAzimuth (degrees)\nEast GDA94\nNorth GDA94\nRL (m)\nSurvey Method\nJUD001\nCore\n810.6\n-90\n360\n571737\n7346272\n357\nGPS\nJUD002\nCore\n774.7\n-90\n360\n572052\n7347015\n366\nGPS\nAnalytical work was carried out on JUD001 and JUD002 by Intertek Laboratories in Perth where each 1m core sample was analysed for a comprehensive multi-element suite of precious metals, base metals and pathfinder elements (49 elements).\nFigure 1 - Drill Hole Collar Locations\nGold and copper results were returned from targeted basement in JUD001 and JUD002.

Today's Issue Price represents a 21.7% discount to the closing bid price of 0.23 pence per share on 15 December 2025.\nThe Fundraise was met with strong demand from investors reflecting growing confidence in the Company's strategy and technical progress. Investor support follows the successful completion of GEO's maiden drilling programme at the Juno Project and recent encouraging exploration developments at the Gorge Project, which together mark important milestones as the Company advances its exploration portfolio across Australia.\nThe net proceeds of the Fundraise will be applied towards ongoing and planned exploration activities at the Gorge Project, funding a follow-on drilling campaign at the Juno Project anticipated in early 2026, providing sufficient working capital to support the Company's expanding operational and corporate requirements, and capitalising on opportunities at PEL 94 (Namibia), including potential farm-out and related transaction costs, particularly in light of increased industry activity in Namibia.\nCMC Markets UK plc, trading as CMC CapX, acted as the Company's sole placing agent.\nHamza Choudhry, Chief Financial Officer of GEO Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by the strong support from investors in this fundraise, which reflects growing confidence in the progress the Company has made across its portfolio and the opportunity ahead.\nThe Company is entering an exciting phase at the Juno Project with results pending from the labs, alongside increasingly encouraging exploration signals at the Gorge Project, including high-grade rock chips and the recovery of large gold nuggets. In parallel, heightened industry interest in Namibia's Walvis Basin following recent offshore developments with Chevron announcing future drills has further sharpened focus on PEL 94.\nWith a strengthened balance sheet, GEO is well positioned to continue advancing its assets in a disciplined manner, grow the business through technical progress across multiple projects, and pursue opportunities that we believe can deliver long-term value for shareholders.\nAs always, we thank all new and existing shareholders for their support as we look forward to taking them with us on the journey ahead.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to AIM for admission of the Placing Shares (the \"New Ordinary Shares\"), which will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.

The Gorge gold project expands the Company's portfolio of highly prospective projects and provides a further opportunity for a potential transformational discovery.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nAll key conditions for the acquisition of Exploration Licence E08/3737 have been satisfied, with final administrative steps underway ahead of transfer into GEO's 100%-owned subsidiary, Gorge Gold Pty Ltd.\n\u00b7\nReview of historical datasets is complete and recent prospecting confirms gold occurrences across approximately 5km of strike, supported by drainage, soil, rock chip sampling and nugget recoveries, pointing to a potential large-scale gold system.\n\u00b7\nMultiple near-surface gold nuggets together with historical high-grade results and widespread surface workings, highlight strong potential for a significant bedrock gold discovery.\n\u00b7\nHigh-resolution airborne magnetic, radiometric and LiDAR surveys are planned for Q1 2026, followed by geochemical sampling, heritage work and first-pass RAB/RC drilling in Q3 2026.\nTransaction\nThe Gorge project currently comprises granted Exploration Licence 08/3737 which is located approximately 110km west of the town of Paraburdoo in Western Australia (Figure 1). The licence covers an area of 81 square kilometres of Proterozoic age metasediments of the Capricorn Orogen and is prospective for several styles of mineralisation, however the Company's primary focus will be large scale gold deposits.\nTerms for the acquisition of the licence were announced to market on 21 October 2025 which included transfer of 100% of the licence and associated information and agreements for a consideration of A$100,000 cash and A$400,000 equivalent in GEO ordinary shares at price of \u00a30.0040 per share. The Vendor retains surface rights to a depth of 2m from surface, limited to 10,000t, and the Company has the right to purchase surface rights prior to 30 June 2030. Further details on transaction terms can be found in the RNS dated 21 October 2025.\nKey conditions for completion of the transaction have been met in recent days and the Company can now proceed to finalisation of administrative tasks and transfer of the licence into the name of Gorge Gold Pty Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of the Company.\nCompilation and Review of Historical Exploration Data\nDuring October and November 2025 historical information was researched and compiled for the Gorge project. This process involved accessing several government databases and historical reports. All data located for the project was documented and relevant information digitally compiled for use with modern GIS software. A summary of historical information is provided below.\nFigure 1 - Gorge Project Location Map\nEarly and Historic Work\nIn the late 1800s small scale miners were active across the licence area collecting alluvial and elluvial gold from within and adjacent to dry stream beds. During this time bedrock sources of primary gold mineralisation were discovered where shallow shafts were established and relatively high-grade gold ore was extracted.\nNewspaper articles published in 1896 and 1897 report bedrock mineralisation at Gorge West extending for more than 1km in length with extracted ore returning 14oz gold per ton (+450g/t gold). At Gorge East (104 Prospect) bedrock mineralisation extended for approximately 200m and extracted ore reported assays of 160oz gold per ton (+5,000g/t gold).\nMore modern exploration for precious metals commenced in the 1980s. Australian Anglo American Limited (AAL) evaluated the Gorge East area (104 Prospect) during 1985 with work including drainage sampling, rock chip sampling and soil sampling. Drainage sample results peaked at 192ppb gold, soils up to 233,300ppb gold (233g/t gold), and rock chip samples up to 62g/t gold (Figure 2). Limited drilling of seven RAB holes and seven diamond holes was completed which included documented results of 1m at 35g/t gold from 1m (RABP005), and 1m at 4.7g/t gold from 26m (DD006) however accurate locations for these holes were not able to be determined from the historical documentation so these hole locations are not currently available in the database but will be confirmed on the ground in the coming months.\nFigure 2 - Gorge East Prospect Previous Exploration Results\nFollowing the positive results of Australian Anglo American Ltd at the Gorge East Prospect, and noting the gold potential of the broader geology, Metana Minerals NL (Metana) embarked on a regional helib",

Assay results are expected to be received by the Company during the current quarter.\nDrill hole JUD002 achieved a total depth of 774.7m and successfully intersected the targeted rock sequences. Good progress was made drilling JUD002 and the hole was completed in a professional and safe manner by the drill contractor.\nDrilling of both JUD001 and JUD002 advanced as planned, intersected the expected rock sequences and achieved adequate depths to assess targets in the drill hole locations.\nThe Company is encouraged by the progress achieved to date at the project and will look to commence Phase 2 of drilling once the necessary approvals are in place, which are expected during the current quarter. Due to seasonal hot weather conditions, the Company will be drilling at Juno at the earliest opportunity in 2026.\nThe Juno Project is a greenfield licence in a region that, historically, has seen very little modern exploration. GEO is among the first movers in this underexplored region, pursuing the opportunity to unlock what could become a district-scale discovery.\nCompletion of JUD001 and JUD002 marks an important first step in building an understanding of the system at Juno, which spans an interpreted footprint of 4 km by 2 km. The Company remains committed to systematic, methodical exploration to fully evaluate the scale of this highly prospective target.\nCallum Baxter, GEO's Joint Venture Partner, commented:\n\"I am pleased JUD001 and JUD002 are complete and that drilling to date has been carried out in a safe and efficient manner. Both holes successfully intersected all anticipated rock sequences and the field team performed exceptionally well. I look forward to additional drilling following receipt of the necessary approvals.\"\nOmar Ahmad, CEO of GEO Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"Completion of drilling of the first two holes at Juno Project represents a significant step forward for GEO. These initial holes provide valuable geological insights into a largely untested system that we believe holds exceptional potential. With assays due this quarter and further drilling planned for early 2026, we are building real momentum in what could become a district-scale discovery.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

Gorge covers an area of 81 square kilometres of Proterozoic age metasediments of the Capricorn Orogen and is prospective for several styles of mineralisation, however the Company's primary focus will be large scale gold deposits.\nHistorical records show sporadic exploration was carried out across the Gorge licence in the mid to late 1980s and late 2000s. This work identified several areas of gold mineralisation at surface over a strike length of approximately 5km (Figure 1).\nIn the mid to late 1980s broad spaced stream sediment sampling, soil sampling, rock chip sampling, and Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drilling was completed within the licence area. Drainage sampling returned gold results including 192ppb and 75ppb and was successful in outlining several areas hosting gold mineralisation at surface. Rock chip sampling at these areas returned gold up to 62.2g/t from quartz veins and 35.7g/t from calcareous sediments. Soils returned up to 233.3g/t gold and shallow RAB drilling of seven holes returned highest result of 36g/t gold.\nFollow up work in the late 2000s included ground reconnaissance and sporadic rock chip sampling. Rock chip results peaked at 134g/t gold and mineralisation was identified over more than 5 kilometres of strike. Several historical hard rock gold workings with associate",

Drill hole JUD001 was completed on 15 September 2025, at a final depth of 810 metres with all targeted rock sequences successfully intersected. Drilling has advanced as planned, and the Company is encouraged by the progress achieved to date.\nFollowing completion of drill hole JUD001, the drill rig was moved to the second prepared pad and JUD002 is now underway. Drill core from JUD001 will be dispatched to a laboratory in the coming days for detailed analytical work. Assay results are expected to be received by the Company during the final quarter of 2025.\nThe Juno Project is a greenfield license in an area that has seen very little modern exploration historically. GEO is among the first movers in this underexplored region, with the opportunity aiming to unlock what could become a district-scale discovery. Completion of JUD001 marks an important first step in building an understanding of the system at Juno, which spans an interpreted footprint of 4 km by 2 km. The Company remains committed to systematic, methodical exploration to fully evaluate the scale of this exciting opportunity.\nCallum Baxter, GEO's Joint Venture Partner, commented:\n\"I am pleased JUD001 is complete and has progressed as planned. The hole successfully intersected all rock sequences we anticipated and the field team are performing very well. The second hole is now underway and we look forward to analytical results during the December quarter.\"\nOmar Ahmad, CEO of GEO Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"Firstly, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Callum Baxter and his team for their vision and technical abilities. Very few geologists in the world have been credited with significant discoveries and we are privileged to have Callum and his team as our long-term partners as we embark on an exciting period ahead for GEO.\nCompletion of our first drill hole at Juno is a key milestone towards unlocking what could be the starting piece of the puzzle for a potential district-scale deposit for GEO. This is our maiden drill programme in a 4 km by 2 km area, and both myself and the team look forward to receiving assays in the December quarter. Each stage of this programme is designed to carefully build our knowledge of Juno's potential and create long-term value for shareholders.\"\nFigure 1 - Drilling equipment on site at drill hole JUD002\nFigure 2 - Juno Project JUD002 drill rig location\nFigure 3 - Drill hole JUD002 underway\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

The programme has commenced with the first drill hole JUD001.\nThis marks a significant operational milestone for the Company, following successful mobilisation of equipment and site preparation. GEO's technical team is on site and working in collaboration with DDH1 Drilling Pty Ltd (\"DDH1\"), Australia's leading diamond drilling contractor. All activities are being conducted in accordance with rigorous safety protocols and operational standards.\nThe drilling programme tests a 4 km \u00d7 2 km geophysical target interpreted as an Intrusion-Related Gold System (IRGS), defined through integrated 3D gravity and magnetic modelling, and further refined by Induced Polarisation (IP) and Electromagnetic (EM) survey data. Initial drilling will reach depths of up to 1,000 metres, with a phased approach designed to incorporate geological results into ongoing targeting.\nThe Juno Project has been benchmarked against early-stage exploration efforts at the Havieron gold-copper deposit, which led to one of Australia's most significant finds of recent times. Based on current geophysical modelling and interpretation, GEO believes the Juno target may represent a mineralised system larger than Havieron.\nThe Company will provide further updates as drilling progresses, including media from the drill site and commentary following a scheduled site visit by GEO's Joint Venture partner Callum Baxter and Non-Executive Director Brian Chu.\nCallum Baxter, GEO's JV Partner, commented:\n\"I am pleased we have rapidly collected the required geophysical data sets resulting in successful modelling and drill targeting at Juno. We have now commenced the Company's maiden drill programme at Juno with hole JUD001 now underway. Collaboratively, we are working alongside DDH1 to safely and efficiently test the large IRGS precious and base metal target, where we will integrate new data into our ongoing exploration efforts.\"\nOmar Ahmad, CEO of GEO Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"Our maiden drill has officially commenced at Juno Project with JUD001, which represents a historic milestone for the Company. Based on preliminary geophysical modelling and interpretation, we believe the Juno Project could represent a mineralised system potentially four to five times the scale of Havieron. We are chasing a very large system which could be a generational discovery if successful. I'm personally excited by what this phase could unlock - both in terms of geological discovery and the potential to deliver a significant uplift in shareholder value.\"\nFigure 1 - Drilling Underway JUD001\nFigure 2 - JUD001 Drill Site Support Equipment\nFigure 3 - JUD001 Drill Equipment Underway\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

The Juno Project is located in central Western Australia where the company is conducting exploration for large Intrusion Related Gold Systems (\"IRGS\") which host precious and base metal mineralisation.\nThe Electrical Geophysical programmes comprised Induced Polarisation (\"IP\") and Electromagnetics (\"EM\") and was carried out over the northern parts of the project area.\nDipole-Dipole IP was carried out to detect subsurface electrically chargeable and electrically resistive bodies at depth. IRGS type mineralisation can demonstrate a chargeable or resistive response relative to host rock and IP can be used as a direct detection method enabling more robust drill targeting. The survey was acquired using a dipole-dipole array with 200m receiver and 400m transmitter dipole with 200m station locations. Four lines of data were collected for a total of 15 line kilometres.\nData was recorded with two 16 channel SmartTEM receivers and a 50KVa Search Exploration high power transmitter. All field data was subject to an intensive QA/QC review prior to modelling. It was found that ground conditions were challenging for chargeability due to near surface conductivity although reasonable repeatability at depth was achieved.\nResistivity data obtained showed excellent repeatability. Following QA/QC the IP data was processed using inverse and forward modelling techniques.\nResults of modelling of IP data were highly encouraging. Resistivity models revealed geological features associated with the eastern and western margins of the 3D magnetic and gravity models over several kilometres of strike. Chargeability models displayed several attractive responses, again, located adjacent to the margins of the 3D modelled magnetic and gravity models over several kilometres of strike (Figures 1 and 2).\nFigure 1 - Dipole-Dipole IP 2D Section Lines. Resistivity (left) showing geological contacts and Conductivity (right) showing chargeability responses.

Resistivity (left) and Chargeability (right). 3D model bodies from RNS dated 28 May 2025.\nThe Company also completed a programme of fixed loop EM at the Juno Project. The EM method allows detection of electrically conductive bodies at depth and provides for spatial modelling of the location of those bodies. The fixed loop EM method, rather than moving loop, was used to increase crew productivity. In total three fixed loops were collected for 14.4 line kilometres of data, using 800m x 800m transmitter loops with 200m spaced receiver lines and 200m receiver station spacings. Data was collected using a DTRX high power transmitter and SmartTEM receiver with a 3 component EMIT B-Field antenna. Data was subject to QA/QC review and found response from early-time channels was subject to surface conductivity, as per the IP data, but good repeatability was achieved for the late-time EM channels of interest. EM data was processed using forward modelling techniques.\nResults of EM data forward modelling were positive, outlining two conductive bodies spatially associated with the 3D modelled magnetic and gravity bodies (Figure 3). These conductive bodies or 'Plates' lie spatially adjacent to, or along strike with, the IP chargeability response (Figure 4).\nFigure 3 - Fixed Loop EM Conductors with modelled 3D magnetic and gravity bodies. 3D model bodies from RNS dated 28 May 2025.\nFigure 4 - Fixed Loop EM Conductors, IP resistivity (left) / conductivity (right) sections, with modelled 3D magnetic and gravity bodies. 3D model bodies from RNS dated 28 May 2025.\nThe geophysical responses observed are consistent with an intrusive body causing the magnetic and gravity responses. This has upgraded the project from an IRGS perspective. The IP and EM responses occur on the contact margins of the interpreted intrusive which is consistent with an IRGS system whereby sulphide mineralisation may develop ",

The Juno project is located in central Western Australia where the company is conducting exploration for large Intrusion Related Gold Systems (IRGS) which host precious and base metal mineralisation.\nBetween late 2024 and early 2025, the Company collected airborne geophysical and ground-gravity data at the Juno Project; results were announced on 16 January 2025 (RNS) and showed a significant gravity response at Juno, aligning with a prominent magnetic feature, covering an area of 4km x 2km. This alignment (coincident response) is a typical signature of IRGS style mineralisation.\nThe detailed magnetic and gravity data sets have recently been further integrated and modelled to refine IRGS type mineralisation targets with accurate 3D spatial definition. Encouraging results have been achieved from independent unconstrained and forward modelling techniques demonstrating the large size of the target and robust data set.\nUnconstrained 3D Modelling confirms the alignment of magnetic and gravity modelled bodies (Figure 1), and that the size of the modelled bodies is large, covering a footprint of approximately 4km x 2km. These results are consistent with preliminary reviews completed in early 2025.\nForward Modelling of the detailed magnetic and gravity data sets was carried out independently during April and May 2025. This modelling technique is the same used for the Havieron IRGS deposit (+8Moz gold equivalent) prior to drilling of discovery holes during 2018. Results of forward modelling at Juno define a chain of contiguous bodies over a strike of several kilometres (Figure 2) which are considered the primary target.\nFigure 1 - Juno Project 3D unconstrained results showing coincident magnetic and gravity model bodies\nModel bodies from Forward Modelling sit tightly within the envelope of the Unconstrained Model bodies. That is, the output of the two independent modelling techniques are aligned, providing a high degree of confidence in the output.\nA very good fit for magnetic and gravity data was seen in the Forward Modelling model body profiles (Figure 3). Depth to top of primary target modelled bodies is approximately 600m below surface showing that a historic deep drillhole (PHD001) was terminated just short of the primary target despite showing proximal alteration and sulphide mineralisation suggesting 'close to source'.\nFigure 2 - Juno Project 3D Forward Modelling results showing primary target\nFigure 3 - Juno Project Forward Modelling Profile 17 showing primary target model body 19\nThe Company is using an IRGS exploration model seeking to locate precious and base metal mineralisation, similar to that at the Havieron and Telfer deposits in northern Western Australia. Activities at Juno to date include recently announced aeromagnetics, lidar, ground gravity, and unconstrained and forward modelling of data.\nOngoing work at Juno will include ground based electrical geophysical surveys to detect subsurface conductive material. Models derived from the exploration data sets will enable enhanced targeting of drillholes in advance of the Company's initial drilling programme at Juno.\nCallum Baxter,\nGeo's\njoint venture partner commented:\n\"It is very pleasing that modelling has provided excellent results in our targeting efforts for IRGS style mineralisation at Juno. The detailed data sets recently collected have allowed the generation of robust 3D models which demonstrate the large size of the Juno target. I look forward to the imminent start of ground electrical geophysics furthering our collaborative efforts at Juno.\"\nOmar Ahmad, CEO of Geo Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"These integrated modelling results deliver exactly what we hoped for: a coherent, large-scale target validated by two independent techniques. We have always had high conviction in both the Juno asset and the world class team driving it forward. We are moving swiftly into ground IP and EM to enhance drillhole targets and are scheduled to commence our first drilling at Juno in the coming months. This is a very exciting time for Geo and our ",

The study has greatly enhanced our understanding of the potential in the eastern portion of PEL94 and it has identified two new sandstone leads - Emerald (in the Albian) and Beryl (in the Cenomanian). The work confirms substantial upside and a materially de\n\u2011\nrisked resource base.\nThe evaluation concludes that Emerald and Beryl together contain 792\nMMbbl of unrisked gross mean prospective resources, with 726\nMMbbl attributable to Emerald and 66\nMMbbl to Beryl. At GEO\n'\ns 78% working interest this equates to 618\nMMbbl of net mean resources, while the assigned weighted Geological Risk Factor (or geological chance of success) yields 103\nMMbbl of risk\n\u2011\nadjusted net mean resources.\nImportantly, these upgraded numbers lift the licence\n\u2011\nwide unrisked gross mean prospective resources on PEL\n94 to approximately 4.31\nbillion barrels, representing a 23\n% increase over the 3.52\nbillion barrels announced on 27\nMarch\n2023. On a risked net basis, GEO\n'\ns share has grown by roughly 32\n% to 429\nMMbbl.\nSeismic mapping has delineated robust, dip and fault\n\u2011\nbounded structural closures. The seismic data interpretation has also highlighted direct hydrocarbon indicators in the area-including gas chimneys and flat spots-providing strong evidence for an active petroleum system, migration of hydrocarbons throughout the section and therefore increasing the chance that the leads are charged with oil. The water depth is c.750 m at the location of the leads identified.\nThe 5798\nkm\n\u00b2\nlicence area sits within the Walvis Basin \"sweet\n\u2011\nspot,\n\"\nan area benefiting from improved charge maturity modelling, while recent world\n\u2011\nclass discoveries in the Orange Basin to the south (Venus, Mopane, Capricornus) highlight the prolific nature of Namibia's Atlantic margin.\nOmar\nAhmad, Chief Executive Officer of GEO Exploration Limited, commented:\n\"Before commenting on these exciting results, I would first like to congratulate Her Excellency Dr Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on her appointment as President of Namibia and Victoria Sibeya on her appointment as Acting\u00a0Managing Director of the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (NAMCOR). I would like to thank Petroleum Commissioner Maggy Shino, the Namibia Ministry of Mines and Energy and our partners for their continued support to Geo.\nToday's resource upgrade underscores the tremendous potential we see in PEL 94 and the strong conviction we have in our Namibian licence. Our technical team has done a terrific job delivering new, material leads on the eastern side of the block. With excitement building across Namibia-and particularly in the Walvis Basin-we are actively progressing farm-out discussions to secure the best outcome for our shareholders\"\nVolumetrics of Prospects and Leads for PEL 94\nThe Prospective Resources are detailed in Table A below and have been classified in accordance with the Society of Petroleum Engineers Petroleum Resources Management System (SPE-PRMS), and have been estimated using a probabilistic method. They are based on 3D and 2D seismic data and geological information, including analogues, to which GEO has access. The prospects are considered viable drilling targets.

These negotiations are part of the Company's ongoing efforts to maximise the value of its asset in the Walvis Basin.\n- Industry activity in the Walvis Basin has intensified, bolstered by Chevron's farm-in for PEL0082 and Tower Resources' farm-out agreement for PEL0096. This increasing interest underscores the growing potential of the region, positioning the Company's PEL0094 licence as a highly attractive opportunity in Namibia's oil exploration landscape.\n- The geological conditions in the Walvis Basin continue to highlight its commercial viability compared to the Orange Basin. The prospects within PEL0094 benefit from lower gas risks and shallower reservoirs, which are less diagenetically altered, enhancing their potential for successful oil exploration. These factors support the Company's belief in the significant value of its Namibian assets.\n- In August 2024, the Company acquired a 70% stake in a joint venture with world class geologist Callum Baxter for mineral exploration in Western Australia, later increasing its interest to 80% in September 2024. Extensive exploration activities, including aeromagnetic and gravity surveys, have been undertaken to refine high-potential drill targets.\n- The geophysical surveys conducted in H2 2024 revealed promising indicators of Intrusion-Related Gold Systems (IRGS) deposits, similar to that of Havieron in the Paterson Province of Western Australia, particularly in the northern project area. LiDAR data received in January 2025 has further enhanced drill planning and subsurface modelling.\n- Key exploration plans for H2 2025 include electromagnetic and polarisation surveys, securing permits, and initiating drilling operations. The Company is well-capitalised to proceed with these H2 2025 plans, following the capital raise in January 2025.\nFinancial:\n- Losses after tax: USD $543,290 (31 December 2023: USD $3,164)\n- Cash and cash equivalents: USD $184,363 (30 June 2024: USD $193,070)\n- Successful capital raise with institutional, high net worth individuals and retail investors totalling \u00a3850,000 in the half year to 31 December 2024.\n- CEO Omar Ahmad extended his\nUSD $270,000 interest free loan to the Company to September 2025.\nStrategy and Outlook:\n- The Company will continue with advanced discussions with the potential farmee for the PEL0094 licence and other interested parties to secure the best outcome for shareholders.\n- Geo will also continue to expedite the work programme for Juno Project.\nThe Company confirms that a full copy of its latest Financial Report - Half Year Ended 31 December 2024 will be available shortly on the Company's website:\nwww.geoexplorationlimited.com\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the UK Market Abuse Regulations (\"MAR\").

          "content": "(Sharecast News) - Geo Exploration said on Wednesday that it has completed the acquisition of the Gorge Project gold exploration licence in Western Australia, and was preparing to start modern exploration work, while continuing discussions over a potential farm-out of its offshore Namibian petroleum licence. The AIM-traded explorer said all final administrative steps relating to the acquisition of Exploration Licence E08/3737 have now been completed, including ministerial consent and payment of the AUD 0.1m (\u00a30.05m) cash consideration. It also issued 48,130,000 consideration shares at 0.4p per share, held in escrow with its registrar until 13 January 2027, in line with the terms announced in October last year. In connection with the transaction, Geo issued a further 18,472,037 ordinary shares to Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee valued at AUD 50,000, priced at 0.135p per share, being the closing share price on 12 January. The company said Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in identifying and progressing the Gorge Project through to completion. It said the Gorge Project covers 81 square kilometres and is located around 110 kilometres west of Paraburdoo within Western Australia's Capricorn Orogen. Geo said historic exploration across the licence area had identified gold mineralisation over approximately five kilometres of strike, including rock chip results of up to 134 grams per tonne of gold and soil samples returning values of up to 233 grams per tonne. Multiple near-surface gold nuggets, ranging from less than two grams to more than 100 grams, had also been recovered, supporting the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source. With the acquisition complete, the company said it was planning systematic exploration programmes using modern techniques to refine geological understanding and prioritise targets ahead of initial drilling, subject to the completion of heritage and access requirements. Separately, Geo updated the market on its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin offshore Namibia, which covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths of between 450 and 1,550 metres. The firm reiterated that it was pursuing a farm-out partner to fund and lead further exploration, noting that several new parties have accessed the data room since late 2024. Geo said increased regional activity, including by Chevron, had reinvigorated interest in the licence, following a previously reported uplift in gross mean prospective resources to around 4.31 billion barrels. \"With the final administrative steps now completed, we are pleased to be in a position to begin exploration at the Gorge Project,\" said chief executive Omar Ahmad. \"The historic grades, widespread surface gold occurrences and recovery of multiple gold nuggets highlight the prospectivity of the licence and support further systematic exploration and future drilling. \"In parallel",

The price then was 35p. Share price this afternoon fast approaching 70p. I do hope a few of you might have had a look and perhaps even got in after doing your own research. I fortunately now have a free run of 25000 shares there and now 3.5 million here. I think both these companies have great futures but with PLSR definitely being the safer option. If people do well here which I really hope they do or if they are looking for something else to add to their portfolios I would still suggest a few hours looking at PLSR and the potential there. Good luck.",

It look very exciting. 100% hit rate so far with the early drills and loads more in the pipeline this year. They want to flow test shortly and those results will really be important and then production seems to be on the agenda in the not too distant future. Strong results here could be very influential on the SP. The helium 3 possibilities are incredible and you need to read up about why that could be massive if you have not already. Might just save people mining the surface on the moon ! You\u2019ve also got Greenland, increasing their US presence with acquisitions and the market for helium expanding all the time with data centres, space travel and medicine etc.  Is the US going to be a massive consumer of helium - yes. I won\u2019t go on as people here will get annoyed but I think it\u2019s worth some serious consideration. Regards.",

Detailed airborne lidar quotations are being sought and it is expected this survey will be complete during the first quarter of 2026. Lidar is particularly helpful for logistics and planning utilising the detailed imagery and accurate spatial definition. Forward Planning Further work to be undertaken includes access rehabilitation and grid based geochemical sampling. These activities are scheduled for Q1 and Q2 2026 along with Heritage surveys in advance of drilling. Following review of results achieved during Q2 2026 initial drilling is scheduled for Q3 2026 which is likely to be Rotary Air Blast (RAB) or Reverse Circulation (RC).",

          "content": "(Sharecast News) - Geo Exploration said on Wednesday that it has completed the acquisition of the Gorge Project gold exploration licence in Western Australia, and was preparing to start modern exploration work, while continuing discussions over a potential farm-out of its offshore Namibian petroleum licence. The AIM-traded explorer said all final administrative steps relating to the acquisition of Exploration Licence E08/3737 have now been completed, including ministerial consent and payment of the AUD 0.1m (\u00a30.05m) cash consideration. It also issued 48,130,000 consideration shares at 0.4p per share, held in escrow with its registrar until 13 January 2027, in line with the terms announced in October last year. In connection with the transaction, Geo issued a further 18,472,037 ordinary shares to Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee valued at AUD 50,000, priced at 0.135p per share, being the closing share price on 12 January. The company said Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in identifying and progressing the Gorge Project through to completion. It said the Gorge Project covers 81 square kilometres and is located around 110 kilometres west of Paraburdoo within Western Australia's Capricorn Orogen. Geo said historic exploration across the licence area had identified gold mineralisation over approximately five kilometres of strike, including rock chip results of up to 134 grams per tonne of gold and soil samples returning values of up to 233 grams per tonne. Multiple near-surface gold nuggets, ranging from less than two grams to more than 100 grams, had also been recovered, supporting the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source. With the acquisition complete, the company said it was planning systematic exploration programmes using modern techniques to refine geological understanding and prioritise targets ahead of initial drilling, subject to the completion of heritage and access requirements. Separately, Geo updated the market on its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin offshore Namibia, which covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths of between 450 and 1,550 metres. The firm reiterated that it was pursuing a farm-out partner to fund and lead further exploration, noting that several new parties have accessed the data room since late 2024. Geo said increased regional activity, including by Chevron, had reinvigorated interest in the licence, following a previously reported uplift in gross mean prospective resources to around 4.31 billion barrels. \"With the final administrative steps now completed, we are pleased to be in a position to begin exploration at the Gorge Project,\" said chief executive Omar Ahmad. \"The historic grades, widespread surface gold occurrences and recovery of multiple gold nuggets highlight the prospectivity of the licence and support further systematic exploration and future drilling. \"In parallel",

I fortunately now have a free run of 25000 shares there and now 3.5 million here. I think both these companies have great futures but with PLSR definitely being the safer option. If people do well here which I really hope they do or if they are looking for something else to add to their portfolios I would still suggest a few hours looking at PLSR and the potential there.

It look very exciting. 100% hit rate so far with the early drills and loads more in the pipeline this year. They want to flow test shortly and those results will really be important and then production seems to be on the agenda in the not too distant future. Strong results here could be very influential on the SP. The helium 3 possibilities are incredible and you need to read up about why that could be massive if you have not already. Might just save people mining the surface on the moon ! You\u2019ve also got Greenland, increasing their US presence with acquisitions and the market for helium expanding all the time with data centres, space travel and medicine etc.  Is the US going to be a massive consumer of helium - yes. I won\u2019t go on as people here will get annoyed but I think it\u2019s worth some serious consideration. Regards.",

Detailed airborne lidar quotations are being sought and it is expected this survey will be complete during the first quarter of 2026. Lidar is particularly helpful for logistics and planning utilising the detailed imagery and accurate spatial definition. Forward Planning Further work to be undertaken includes access rehabilitation and grid based geochemical sampling. These activities are scheduled for Q1 and Q2 2026 along with Heritage surveys in advance of drilling. Following review of results achieved during Q2 2026 initial drilling is scheduled for Q3 2026 which is likely to be Rotary Air Blast (RAB) or Reverse Circulation (RC).",

          "content": "(Sharecast News) - Geo Exploration said on Wednesday that it has completed the acquisition of the Gorge Project gold exploration licence in Western Australia, and was preparing to start modern exploration work, while continuing discussions over a potential farm-out of its offshore Namibian petroleum licence. The AIM-traded explorer said all final administrative steps relating to the acquisition of Exploration Licence E08/3737 have now been completed, including ministerial consent and payment of the AUD 0.1m (\u00a30.05m) cash consideration. It also issued 48,130,000 consideration shares at 0.4p per share, held in escrow with its registrar until 13 January 2027, in line with the terms announced in October last year. In connection with the transaction, Geo issued a further 18,472,037 ordinary shares to Callum Baxter in settlement of a consultancy fee valued at AUD 50,000, priced at 0.135p per share, being the closing share price on 12 January. The company said Baxter provided material technical and commercial assistance in identifying and progressing the Gorge Project through to completion. It said the Gorge Project covers 81 square kilometres and is located around 110 kilometres west of Paraburdoo within Western Australia's Capricorn Orogen. Geo said historic exploration across the licence area had identified gold mineralisation over approximately five kilometres of strike, including rock chip results of up to 134 grams per tonne of gold and soil samples returning values of up to 233 grams per tonne. Multiple near-surface gold nuggets, ranging from less than two grams to more than 100 grams, had also been recovered, supporting the potential presence of a primary bedrock gold source. With the acquisition complete, the company said it was planning systematic exploration programmes using modern techniques to refine geological understanding and prioritise targets ahead of initial drilling, subject to the completion of heritage and access requirements. Separately, Geo updated the market on its 78% interest in Petroleum Exploration Licence 0094 in the Walvis Basin offshore Namibia, which covers 5,798 square kilometres in water depths of between 450 and 1,550 metres. The firm reiterated that it was pursuing a farm-out partner to fund and lead further exploration, noting that several new parties have accessed the data room since late 2024. Geo said increased regional activity, including by Chevron, had reinvigorated interest in the licence, following a previously reported uplift in gross mean prospective resources to around 4.31 billion barrels. \"With the final administrative steps now completed, we are pleased to be in a position to begin exploration at the Gorge Project,\" said chief executive Omar Ahmad. \"The historic grades, widespread surface gold occurrences and recovery of multiple gold nuggets highlight the prospectivity of the licence and support further systematic exploration and future drilling. \"In parallel",

          "full_content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 9747R\nGeo Exploration Limited\n06 February 2026\n06 February 2026\nGEO Exploration Limited\n(\"GEO \" or the \"Company\")\nDirector Equity Remuneration, Warrant Extension\nand Option Awards Related Party Transactions\nGEO Exploration Limited (AIM: GEO) announces that the Board has approved a number of equity-based remuneration and incentive arrangements in accordance with the Company's existing contractual obligations and long-term incentive framework.\nThe approvals form part of a single, integrated remuneration and incentive package approved by the Board, comprising the settlement of agreed director remuneration in shares, the grant of share options and the extension of certain warrant terms. The Board believes that the use of equity-based remuneration is appropriate for the Company and supports long-term alignment between management and shareholders.\nIssue of Shares - Director Remuneration\nAt the time of the appointments of Omar Ahmad, Hamza Choudhry and Azib Khan as Executive Directors, their remuneration was agreed in the form of cash and shares. As announced on 5 December 2024, Brian Chu receives 20% of his Non-Executive Director fees in shares. However, as the Company had unpublished inside information the award of shares had to be deferred. Accordingly, the Company has now issued new ordinary shares as follows:\n\u00b7\n54,975,000 ordinary shares to Azib Khan, representing unpaid fees from 2024, which Mr Khan has agreed to receive as stock in lieu of cash, with an aggregate value of \u00a376,965, calculated at the market price on 16 January 2026. These fees were accrued within the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2025.\n\u00b7\n46,100,000 ordinary shares each (being 138,300,000 ordinary shares in aggregate) to Hamza Choudhry, Omar Ahmad and Azib Khan, issued to the executive directors and accepted prudently in lieu of cash remuneration, consistent with the directors' long-term alignment with shareholders; and\n\u00b7\n3,062,832 ordinary shares to Brian Chu in satisfaction of contractual remuneration relating to his role as Non-Executive Director. As announced on 5 December 2024, Brian Chu receives 20% of his Non-Executive Director fees in shares. The number of shares is based on the 5-day VWAP at each quarter end as follows:\nQuarter End\n5-Day VWAP\nNumber of Shares\n31 December 2024\n0.298p\n116,308\n31 March 2025\n0.124p\n982,816\n30 June 2025\n0.128p\n931,702\n30 September 2025\n0.358p\n684,679\n31 December 2025\n0.180p\n1,379,331\nThe Board notes that, at the time of appointment, the relevant directors elected to receive equity in lieu of cash remuneration, having regard to the Company's circumstances at that time, including its stage of development, capital priorities and liquidity considerations. The Board considers that this approach appropriately aligned the directors with shareholders from the outset, preserved cash resources for operational and strategic purposes, and was consistent with market practice for AIM-listed companies at a comparable stage.\nAll new ordinary shares will rank pari passu with the Company's existing ordinary shares.\nExtension of Warrants from August 2023 Capital Raise\nThe Board has approved an extension to the expiry date of warrants awarded as part of the Company's placing completed in August 2023. The expiry date of all remaining warrants has been extended by 36 months to 6 September 2029, on otherwise unchanged terms.\nTwo Directors, Omar Ahmad and Hamza Choudhry, hold approximately 79% of the remaining outstanding warrants and are therefore related parties under the AIM Rules. The Directors believe that this will benefit the Company by incentivising the relevant directors to continue to drive the Company's projects forward for the benefit of all shareholders and will, when exercised, provide funds for the Company.\nWarrant holder\nNumber\nExercise Price\nRevised Expiry\nOmar Ahmad\n150,000,000\n0.1p\n6 September 2026\nHamza Choudhry\n40,000,000\n0.1p\n6 September 2026\nMichael Joseph\n50,000,000\n0.1p\n6 September 2026\nTotal\n240,000,000\nAll of the warrant holders have given their consent to this change in accordance with the terms of these instruments.\nShare Option Awards - Summary of Terms\nIn order to continue to retain and incentivise the services of the Directors, and to align their interests with those of the Company and its shareholders, the Board has approved the following awards of options to subscribe for new ordinary shares:\nName\nNumber\nExercise Price\nDate Appointed\nOmar Ahmad\u00a0(CEO)\n150,000,000\n0.1211p\n5 September 2024\nHamza Choudhry (CFO)\n150,000,000\n0.1211p\n5 September 2024\nAzib Khan (CCO)\n150,000,000\n0.1211p\n5 December 2024\nBrian Chu\u00a0(NED)\n40,000,000\n0.1211p\n3 December 2024\nTotal\n490,000,000\nThere are 110,000,000 options already in issue: 50,000,000 held by Azib Khan and the remaining 60,000,000 held by employees and former directors. The existing options and proposed options held by current directors will represent c.10% of the issued share capital.\nAll options are to have an expiry",

The Namibia JV hasn\u2019t landed yet, but interest in the Walvis Basin has clearly increased recently, and the company has said multiple parties are now involved. These deals are complex and timing rarely sits with the junior partner, so delays don\u2019t necessarily mean failure. On the gold side, yes exploration is high risk and takes time, but Juno has at least confirmed a mineralised system rather than a barren target, which is an important early step technically. Bringing in someone like Callum Baxter isn\u2019t just about hype \u2014 his role is to interpret early-stage results and guide follow-up targeting, which is exactly what seems to be happening now. Dilution is frustrating but also fairly typical for a small explorer without revenue; the key question is whether capital is being used to advance assets, and Gorge and Namibia activity suggests they are trying to build multiple shots on goal. Ultimately 2026 probably becomes the proving year \u2014 either we see tangible progress (farm-out, better targeting, meaningful exploration results), or shareholder patience will run thin. For now I see a company repositioning rather than standing still.",

The whole thing was just sketchy- how a couple of mates who did some consultancy for the firm- ended up being CEO and finance director respectively. The change of name.....the pivot into gold...the 3 drill holes that ended up being 2, the pivot into Gorge, the constant posting about other companies from the CEO, the loan that he gave then paid himself back to get your confidence. Thought it would be cool to be a CEO and now he is feeling the heat about being in the hot seat. Now he has blocked anyone from responding on both his personal and business account. Has anyone actually looked up his resume/CV? I dont think he was ever qualified to be CEO- like many AIM companies. I dont think he will recover from this. 1) the 3rd hole was supposed to be drilled in January- no word about this- with the sh*t poor 1st assays, it is wasted money 2) if you start from point A with Gorge again, it will require another significant placing to prove up- which will decimate the SP- this is what GBP/GEO have been doing for years. 3) A deal in Namibia is the *ONLY* way you will see the SP going up significantly...since they started farm-in discussions- we have had a pandemic- we are on our 3rd PM, Trump has come back into power etc etc. Maybe this time he realises it is his only option and the gold is not going anywhere- maybe he will give it the priority.

Tmrw if this breaches 30% I reckon farm out is about to land, I believe some in the know got news today and tmrw everyone in the know maybe getting in if my theory is correct Or today was just buyers getting in cheap",

The Namibia JV hasn\u2019t landed yet, but interest in the Walvis Basin has clearly increased recently, and the company has said multiple parties are now involved. These deals are complex and timing rarely sits with the junior partner, so delays don\u2019t necessarily mean failure. On the gold side, yes exploration is high risk and takes time, but Juno has at least confirmed a mineralised system rather than a barren target, which is an important early step technically. Bringing in someone like Callum Baxter isn\u2019t just about hype \u2014 his role is to interpret early-stage results and guide follow-up targeting, which is exactly what seems to be happening now. Dilution is frustrating but also fairly typical for a small explorer without revenue; the key question is whether capital is being used to advance assets, and Gorge and Namibia activity suggests they are trying to build multiple shots on goal. Ultimately 2026 probably becomes the proving year \u2014 either we see tangible progress (farm-out, better targeting, meaningful exploration results), or shareholder patience will run thin. For now I see a company repositioning rather than standing still.",

The Namibia JV hasn\u2019t landed yet, but interest in the Walvis Basin has clearly increased recently, and the company has said multiple parties are now involved. These deals are complex and timing rarely sits with the junior partner, so delays don\u2019t necessarily mean failure. On the gold side, yes exploration is high risk and takes time, but Juno has at least confirmed a mineralised system rather than a barren target, which is an important early step technically. Bringing in someone like Callum Baxter isn\u2019t just about hype \u2014 his role is to interpret early-stage results and guide follow-up targeting, which is exactly what seems to be happening now. Dilution is frustrating but also fairly typical for a small explorer without revenue; the key question is whether capital is being used to advance assets, and Gorge and Namibia activity suggests they are trying to build multiple shots on goal. Ultimately 2026 probably becomes the proving year \u2014 either we see tangible progress (farm-out, better targeting, meaningful exploration results), or shareholder patience will run thin. For now I see a company repositioning rather than standing still.",

The whole thing was just sketchy- how a couple of mates who did some consultancy for the firm- ended up being CEO and finance director respectively. The change of name.....the pivot into gold...the 3 drill holes that ended up being 2, the pivot into Gorge, the constant posting about other companies from the CEO, the loan that he gave then paid himself back to get your confidence. Thought it would be cool to be a CEO and now he is feeling the heat about being in the hot seat. Now he has blocked anyone from responding on both his personal and business account. Has anyone actually looked up his resume/CV? I dont think he was ever qualified to be CEO- like many AIM companies. I dont think he will recover from this. 1) the 3rd hole was supposed to be drilled in January- no word about this- with the sh*t poor 1st assays, it is wasted money 2) if you start from point A with Gorge again, it will require another significant placing to prove up- which will decimate the SP- this is what GBP/GEO have been doing for years. 3) A deal in Namibia is the *ONLY* way you will see the SP going up significantly...since they started farm-in discussions- we have had a pandemic- we are on our 3rd PM, Trump has come back into power etc etc. Maybe this time he realises it is his only option and the gold is not going anywhere- maybe he will give it the priority.

The Namibia JV hasn\u2019t landed yet, but interest in the Walvis Basin has clearly increased recently, and the company has said multiple parties are now involved. These deals are complex and timing rarely sits with the junior partner, so delays don\u2019t necessarily mean failure. On the gold side, yes exploration is high risk and takes time, but Juno has at least confirmed a mineralised system rather than a barren target, which is an important early step technically. Bringing in someone like Callum Baxter isn\u2019t just about hype \u2014 his role is to interpret early-stage results and guide follow-up targeting, which is exactly what seems to be happening now. Dilution is frustrating but also fairly typical for a small explorer without revenue; the key question is whether capital is being used to advance assets, and Gorge and Namibia activity suggests they are trying to build multiple shots on goal. Ultimately 2026 probably becomes the proving year \u2014 either we see tangible progress (farm-out, better targeting, meaningful exploration results), or shareholder patience will run thin. For now I see a company repositioning rather than standing still.",

The Namibia JV hasn\u2019t landed yet, but interest in the Walvis Basin has clearly increased recently, and the company has said multiple parties are now involved. These deals are complex and timing rarely sits with the junior partner, so delays don\u2019t necessarily mean failure. On the gold side, yes exploration is high risk and takes time, but Juno has at least confirmed a mineralised system rather than a barren target, which is an important early step technically. Bringing in someone like Callum Baxter isn\u2019t just about hype \u2014 his role is to interpret early-stage results and guide follow-up targeting, which is exactly what seems to be happening now. Dilution is frustrating but also fairly typical for a small explorer without revenue; the key question is whether capital is being used to advance assets, and Gorge and Namibia activity suggests they are trying to build multiple shots on goal. Ultimately 2026 probably becomes the proving year \u2014 either we see tangible progress (farm-out, better targeting, meaningful exploration results), or shareholder patience will run thin. For now I see a company repositioning rather than standing still.",

Let's not forget Omar has a Twitter history of constantly pumping/mentioning other companies, not behaviour one would expect of a CEO of a listed company.  This company was pumped when Callum Baxter showed up .... but he is a well paid consultant so he makes off well regardless if the gold drilling is successful or not.

With Gorge moving into execution, Namibia attracting renewed interest, and Juno now better vectorised, the alignment between management and shareholders feels stronger than ever \u2014 and that\u2019s often where the real upside starts to build quietly before the market notices.",

As Namibia\u2019s offshore projects advance toward development, the demand for regional expertise, subsurface knowledge and supporting operators increases, placing companies with strategic positioning in the basin, including GEO, directly in the path of expanding industry activity. Historically, once majors commit at this scale, the wider value chain follows \u2014 and early-stage players leveraged to the basin\u2019s growth can benefit disproportionately as Namibia evolves into one of the world\u2019s newest large-scale hydrocarbon provinces.",

The whole thing was just sketchy- how a couple of mates who did some consultancy for the firm- ended up being CEO and finance director respectively. The change of name.....the pivot into gold...the 3 drill holes that ended up being 2, the pivot into Gorge, the constant posting about other companies from the CEO, the loan that he gave then paid himself back to get your confidence. Thought it would be cool to be a CEO and now he is feeling the heat about being in the hot seat. Now he has blocked anyone from responding on both his personal and business account. Has anyone actually looked up his resume/CV? I dont think he was ever qualified to be CEO- like many AIM companies. I dont think he will recover from this. 1) the 3rd hole was supposed to be drilled in January- no word about this- with the sh*t poor 1st assays, it is wasted money 2) if you start from point A with Gorge again, it will require another significant placing to prove up- which will decimate the SP- this is what GBP/GEO have been doing for years. 3) A deal in Namibia is the *ONLY* way you will see the SP going up significantly...since they started farm-in discussions- we have had a pandemic- we are on our 3rd PM, Trump has come back into power etc etc. Maybe this time he realises it is his only option and the gold is not going anywhere- maybe he will give it the priority.
