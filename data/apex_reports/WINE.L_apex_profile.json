The decline in revenue remained consistent with the prior reporting period and guidance, reflecting the strategy of recalibrating around the profitable core, while average order value and revenue per member were ahead on a constant currency basis.\nPeak Season Trading:\n\u00b7\nRevenue declined by -19% at constant currency vs prior year (-21% vs reported), in line with expectations, including repeat sales which were down -16% at constant currency (-18% vs reported)\n\u00b7\nAverage order value increased by 5% at constant currency (4% vs reported)\n\u00b7\nRevenue per member increased by 1% at constant currency (-1% vs reported)\nCommenting on the peak season trading, Rodrigo Maza, CEO, said:\n\"Peak season trading has been pleasing, reflecting the hard work by all our teams to deliver for customers and the focus on our unique customer proposition. We continue to make good progress against our strategic KPIs and remain committed to delivering shareholder value. Current trading is in line with guidance, and we look forward to providing a more detailed update in our full year trading update at the end of April.\"\nIssued Share Capital:\nFollowing the share buyback in December 2025, and as at the date of this announcement, the Company's total issued ordinary share capital is 71,717,079, with 2,766,665 ordinary shares held in treasury, and the total number of voting rights in the Company is 68,950,414. The figure of 68,950,414 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company, under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.\nFY26 guidance\n1\n:\nKPI\nFY26\nRevenue\n\u00a3200m to \u00a3216m\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\n(excl. inventory liquidation and associated costs)\n\u00a35.5m to \u00a37.5m\nNet cash (excl. lease liabilities)\n3,4\n\u00a333m to \u00a335m\nInventory liquidations and associated costs\n5\nc.$17m of inventory liquidation cost over the Medium Term\n1.
