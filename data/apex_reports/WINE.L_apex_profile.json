Under these arrangements, Panmure Liberum will make trading decisions in relation to the buyback of the Group's ordinary shares of 7.5 pence each independently of the Group within the programme terms and pre-set parameters.\nIn line with the authority given at the 2025 AGM, the maximum price per Ordinary Share (exclusive of expenses) may not exceed the higher of 105 per cent of the average middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Ordinary Share is purchased; an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share; and the highest current independent purchase bid for an ordinary share on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out at the relevant time, including when shares are traded on different venues.\nAll Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Group under the Share Buyback Programme will be held in treasury. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and do not participate in dividends.\nShare purchases under the Share Buyback Programme will continue to take place in open market transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price and trading volumes. The Share Buyback Programme will be effected under the authority granted by shareholders at the Group's September 2025 Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") to purchase a maximum of 7,400,413 Ordinary Shares, under which authority to purchase 4,281,192 Ordinary Shares remains.\nShareholders should be aware that given all Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Group under the Share Buyback Programme will be held in treasury, and given the Share Buyback Programme may on any given trading day represent a significant portion of the daily traded volume in the Group's Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange, and the Group expects daily volumes to exceed 25% of the average daily traded volume on the London Stock Exchange. Accordingly, the Group will not benefit from the exemption contained in Article 5(1) of MAR.\nOutside of the above, the Share Buyback Programme will be conducted in accordance with the other safe harbour parameters as prescribed by MAR insofar as possible. The Group has authorised the Share Buyback Programme to commence from today and will continue until the earlier of: the date on which the Maximum Amount payable by the Company has been reached, or 31st March 2026.\nAny market purchase of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Programme will be announced no later than 7:30am (UK time) on the business day following the day on which the purchase occurred.\nThe Group confirms that it currently has no unpublished price sensitive information.\nOngoing capital distributions policy\nThe Company's aim with regards to ongoing capital distributions is to return up to 50% of adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation costs or the increase in net cash (excluding shareholder distributions), whichever is lower, subject to the Board's assessment of the Group's financial position, liquidity requirements and investment opportunities.\nConsistent with previous communications, the Company also intends to return additional capital through ad hoc share buybacks over and above this as the Board judges to be in the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Share Buyback Programme announced today is an additional ad hoc distribution, separate to the Company's ongoing capital distribution policy that has, and will continue to, be applied.\nThe Board will continue to keep capital allocation under review and will update shareholders as appropriate.\nFor further information, please contact:\nNaked Wines plc\nRodrigo Maza, Chief Executive Officer\nDominic Neary, Chief Financial Officer\nCatherine Miles, Investor Relations\nIR@nakedwines.com\nPanmure Liberum (NOMAD and Broker)\nEd Thomas / John More / Dru Danford\nTel: 0203 100 2222\nVigo Consulting (Financial PR)\nTim McCall / Guy Scarborough / Damian Reece\nTel: 0207 390 0230\nAbout Naked Wines\nNaked Wines\nis not just an online wine retailer; we're trailblazers on a mission to enable enthusiastic wine drinkers to enjoy great wine without the guesswork.\nFounded in 2008, on the pillars of quality, choice and fair pricing, we set out to create the most inclusive wine club in the world - dedicated to transforming the wine-buying experience and empowering people to make their own wine choices, and championing world-class independent winemakers.
