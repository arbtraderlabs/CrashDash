EBITDA\neil&ac 1\nsignificantly ahead of prior year, with performance in line with full year guidance\"\nOverview:\nHY26 delivered significant progress, including improved adjusted EBITDA\neilac\n1\nand Gross Profit Margin, cash generation and delivery against the KPIs set out in the new Strategic Plan articulated in March 2025. The Company also successfully completed its first share buyback programme, which we believe has increased intrinsic value per share for all remaining shareholders.\nThe Board and Leadership team have been strengthened, with Jack Pailing moving to Non-Executive Chair, Jan-Hendrik Mohr joining as Non-Executive Director, and David Atchison providing Board advisory support focused on advancing our marketing strategy and customer growth initiatives. Performance is continuing in line with FY26 guidance, which supports our medium term\n2\ngoals of progressive growth in adj. EBITDA\neil&ac\n, continued cash generation, and recalibrating revenue around our highly profitable core.\nFinancial Highlights:\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\neil&ac\nof \u00a33.6m up 112% on prior year (HY25: \u00a31.7m), comfortably within guidance for the full year\n\u00b7\nNet Cash excluding lease liabilities up \u00a38.2m to \u00a331.1m vs prior year (HY25: \u00a322.9m), reflecting \u00a310m of cash generation less the \u00a32m share buyback completed in September 2025, and up \u00a31m vs March 2025\n\u00b7\nRevenue of \u00a389.5m (HY25: reported \u00a3112.3m, constant currency \u00a3108.9m) reducing in line with communicated FY26 guidance and our strategy of recalibrating around our highly profitable Core Members (-18% constant FX / -20% actual FX); this reflects the impact of the normal decline of exceptional cohorts acquired in FY21 and FY22, the removal of inefficient acquisition investment in late FY25 and FY26, and cautious consumer behaviour across the economy\n\u00b7\nStatutory loss before tax reduced to \u00a33.0m (HY25: loss of \u00a35.6m), after \u00a32.5m of adjusted items (HY25: \u00a31.9m) and \u00a32.6m of the communicated $17m/\u00a312m medium term inventory liquidation and associated costs (HY25: \u00a33.7m)\nDelivering on our Strategic Plan:\nRelease cash tied up on the balance sheet:\n\u00b7\nFree Cash Flow of \u00a34.7m versus \u00a37.4m for prior year, primarily driven by cash generation through payables and Angel funds offset by cash consumption through inventory, as we stock build for peak as planned but at higher levels than prior year\n\u00b7\nFirst share buyback programme under our new Capital Allocation Policy successfully completed, with \u00a32m purchased at prices well below the Board's view of intrinsic value\n\u00b7\nReturn On Equity and Cash of 11% versus 5% in HY25, largely driven by the significant growth in adjusted EBITDA\neil&ac\nRecalibrate around a profitable core:\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\neil&ac\nof \u00a33.6m up 112% on prior year (HY25: \u00a31.7m), in line with guidance for the full year\n\u00b7\nGross Profit Margin improving to 19.5% (HY25: 16.9%): 50%\n3\nof this driven by price increases and cost savings such as reduced acquisition cost; with the balance largely reflecting higher FY25 inventory costs\n\u00b7\nAs communicated in August, we have now determined our replacement metric for 'Payback': Acquisition Break-even months. The target for this is break-even on acquisition investment within 24 months, which equates to a post-tax IRR of 23% and a 5-year forecast payback of 1.7x\n1 adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation and associated costs\n2 Medium Term = 3 - 5 years\n3 the balance of the margin improvement reflected changes in inventory movements\nReturn to sustainable growth:\n\u00b7\nCore Members (customers who have been with us for more than two years) remain both highly profitable and deeply engaged, with key satisfaction and retention metrics continuing to be strong. Customer Net Promoter Score* (NPS) of 76, rated 'excellent', was consistent with the prior year. Member Retention Rate* held strong vs prior year at 76%, representing a 100 bps improvement on the FY25 close (75%)\n\u00b7\nCustomer acquisition investment was reduced to \u00a33.9m (HY25: \u00a39.4m) as a result of removing inefficient spend in line with our redefined marketing strategy, as previously communicated this will lead to a smaller more profitable business\n\u00b7\nDemonstrable progress being made on Acquisition Break-even*, falling from 75 months in HY25 to\n44\nmonths in the 5 months to August 2025**; this reflects improved channel management, reduced Customer Acquisition Cost (\u00a369 from \u00a378), and gross profit margin improvement (19.5% vs 16.9%)\n\u00b7\nInitial revenue coming from new US growth opportunities. The recently acquired Sonoma winery, established to generate manufacturing and storage savings, also provides the opportunity for new sales in custom crush and bulk storage. Going forward we also see opportunities in private label production.\nPost Period End and Current Trading:\n\u00b7\nPerformance continues to be in line with the communicated FY26 guidance, which supports progressive growth in adjusted\nEBITDAeil&ac\n\u00b7\nGross profit margin continuing to improve, benefiting from the annualisation and compounding effect of cost efficiencies and pricing strategy\n\u00b7\nLiquidation of excess inventory continuing as planned, supporting strong cash generation towards the target of \u00a340m over the medium term\n\u00b7\nCommitted to ongoing distributions in line with our new Capital Allocation policy, and currently engaged with finance partners on future share distributions\n\u00b7\nRemain focused on disciplined return to organic revenue growth in the medium term, while also considering inorganic opportunities that drive shareholder value as they arise\nCommenting on the HY26 performance, Rodrigo Maza, CEO, said:\n\"I'm pleased to present first-half results that show tangible progress against the goals we set in March, and adj. EBITDA profitability up 112% on prior year. We're delivering in line with guidance, and I remain confident that our Strategic Plan will create meaningful value for shareholders.\n\"Lower CACs and improved margins have helped reduce Acquisition break-even from 75 to 44 months - significant progress. Combined with our strong performance on cash and improved profitability, this provides robust foundations as we build towards a return to disciplined revenue growth in the medium term.\"\n* Definitions included with KPI definitions\n** This being the cohorts (April - August) that have reached at least a 3 month tenure threshold at which point this metric is more stable\n.\nFinancials\nHY26\nHY25\nchange\nTotal revenue\n\u00a389.5m\n\u00a3112.3m\n-\u00a322.8m\nAdjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation and associated costs1\n\u00a33.6m\n\u00a31.7m\n+\u00a31.9m\nStatutory loss before tax\n\u00a3(3.0)m\n\u00a3(5.6)m\n+\u00a32.6m\nNet cash (excl. lease liabilities)\n\u00a331.1m\n\u00a322.9m\n+\u00a38.2m\nKPIs\nNPS2\n76\n76\n-\nMember Retention Rate %3\n76%\n76%\n-\nCustomer Acquisition Cost4\n\u00a369\n\u00a378\n-\u00a39\nRevenue Per Member5\n\u00a3162\n\u00a3168\n-\u00a36\nGross Profit Margin %6\n19.5%\n16.9%\n+260 bps\n5-Year Payback (old metric)7\n1.2x\n0.9x\n+0.3x\nAcquisition Break-even (months) (new metric)8\n44\n75\n-31\nFree Cash Flow9\n\u00a34.7m\n\u00a37.4m\n-\u00a32.7m\nReturn On Equity and Cash10, 11\n11%\n5%\n+600bps\nKPIs as introduced, and reported, at FY25 year end\n1.

Customer Net Promoter Score: Measures customer loyalty and satisfaction based on the likelihood of customers to recommend Naked to others. (NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors)\n3. Member Retention Rate %: The % of members at the start of the financial year that are retained at the end of the financial year\n4.

This payback KPI will be replaced with the new Acquisition Break-even months metric, reported here for the first time.\n8. Acquisition Break-even = The number of months it takes for the profit generated from a newly acquired customer to cover the cost of acquiring that customer. HY25 performance of 75 months is based on a standardised/averaged contribution curve from 3 years of data - using this model, HY26 ABe would have been 42 months not 44.\n9. FCF = Free Cash Flow: Operating cash flow less capital expenditure\n10. ROEC = Return On Equity and Cash: adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation and associated costs as a percentage of equity including cash and cash equivalents. We have included cash in the denominator because we have committed to distributing as much cash as possible in the coming years. Doing so, will be reflected in this metric.\n11. The HY26 and HY25 ROEC scores have been based on 2 x adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation and associated costs (as an annualised proxy reference point in the calculation) as a percentage of equity including cash and cash equivalents\n5-Year Payback and Acquisition Break-even for HY26 reflect the cohorts acquired for the 5 months to end August 2025. This being the cohorts (Apr - Aug) that have reached at least a 3 month tenure threshold at which point these metrics become more stable. This threshold will be applied to future reporting.\nFor further information, please contact:\nNaked Wines plc\nRodrigo Maza, Chief Executive Officer\nDominic Neary, Chief Financial Officer\nCatherine Miles, Investors Relations\nIR@nakedwines.com\nPanmure Liberum (Nomad & Joint Broker)\nEd Thomas / John More / Dru Danford\nTel: 0203 100 2222\nVigo Consulting (Financial PR)\nGuy Scarborough / Damian Reece / Tim McCall\nTel: 0207 390 0230\nCEO Overview: Building Momentum Through Focus and Discipline\nOver the past six months, Naked has continued to make tangible progress against the three pillars of the strategy we shared in March:\nRelease cash from the balance sheet\n,\nRecalibrate around our profitable core\n, and driving a\nReturn to sustainable growth\n. Dominic will expand on the first two in his review; I'll focus on how we're building the foundations for growth.\nWe have significantly strengthened both our Board and Leadership Team.\nJack Pailing moving to Non-Executive Chair, and\nJan Mohr, a long standing shareholder and new Non-Executive Director, bringing a broad variety of experience to the Board, including a strong track record of value creation through M&A at Chapters Group. Dave Atchison advisory role also meaningfully supplementing the Board's Marketing expertise, notably in US based digital companies.\nOur Global Leadership Team is now complete, following the appointments of Anneleen Straetemans as Chief People & Legal Officer and Alice Thompson as Chief Operating Officer. Together, we continue to embed a\nhigh-performance culture\n, crystallising our values and linking them directly to results and talent management. Naked today is faster, more effective, and more accountable.\nGrowth begins with\ncustomer\nretention\n- and we are seeing encouraging momentum. Metrics across Net Promoter Score and core member retention rates remain strong, reflecting our focus on delivering\ngreat value, a frictionless experience, and no guesswork\nfor our Angels.\nReconnecting our community has also been central to our progress. Recent campaigns have focused on reminding us all of what makes Naked special:\na community that rallies behind the people who make great wine possible\n. These moments restored pride among Angels, Winemakers, and our teams alike.\nArco's Final Vintage:\nWhen much-loved South African winemaker Arco Laarman sadly passed away last year, fellow\u00a0Naked winemaker Johan Kruger helped his family complete Arco's final vintages. The wines were received to many\u00a0touching tributes from our members, and to honour Arco's legacy, we're donating all profits from their sale to a fund for\u00a0his daughter's education, a demonstration that the people behind our wines remain at the heart of everything we do.\nCorbi\u00e8res Rescue Case\n: After wildfires devastated vineyards in Corbi\u00e8res, the Naked community rallied together through a crowdfunded rescue case organised by winemaker Katie Jones. 7,000 members pledged support within days, providing vital funds for those affected. It was a powerful reminder of the compassion and commitment to helping others that\u00a0make our community unique.\nWe've also expanded the\nCredit Back Guarantee\nglobally, giving customers the confidence to explore our range and discover new wines risk-free; a key step toward restoring Naked's sense of adventure and discovery. We continue to explore different benefits that improve our proposition and offering for Angels and will scale those with the highest impact.\nOn the\ncustomer\nacquisition\nfront, our channel mix looks very different from a year ago. We've deliberately exited low-quality, high-churn channels, focusing investment on those that attract the right Angels - customers who value connection, quality, and fair prices. This disciplined approach has materially reduced Customer Acquisition Cost across all markets, improved first-order economics, and is driving a meaningful improvement in payback. While volumes are down as a result, this is a deliberate trade-off. We are scaling only where returns are sustainable.\nAt the same time, we're investing in the\nredesign of our homepage and customer journey\n, making Naked's value proposition clearer and more transparent. This work represents an essential driver of future growth.\nWe continue to make progress in our digital transformation programme, with workstreams across the business improving both efficiency and customer experience, and early results show strong productivity gains.\nIn B2B, what started as an outlet for surplus inventory is becoming a credible, profitable revenue stream. Our new Sonoma facility will allow us to leverage excess capacity to provide services such as custom crush and bulk wine storage, generating incremental profit and further cash generation\nWe're now a business creating steady, reliable cashflows, with a plan to reinvest in ways that strengthen Naked's long-term position. As we continue to deliver, we will assess inorganic\nopportunities that could enhance shareholder value\nand reinforce our community-led model as they arise.\nThe last 18 months have not been easy, but they've been transformative. We've sharpened our culture, strengthened our team, and rebuilt momentum. The strategy is clear, the foundations are solid; it's about execution now, and that execution keeps improving. As the Brits say, I'm feeling\nquite\noptimistic.\nRodrigo Maza\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\nCFO Overview: Cash and profitability and value creation\nHY26 has seen significant progress with the strategy we communicated in March. We remain confident that we will continue to deliver the value to shareholders we identified over the medium term.\nRelease cash tied up on the balance sheet\nWe continue to make significant progress with a notable \u00a38.2m increase in net cash excluding lease liabilities on prior year, and a \u00a31.0m increase on March 2025:\n\u00b7\nThis represents cash generation driven by ongoing adjusted EBITDA improvements\n\u00b7\nInventory has fallen by \u00a326m vs prior year and despite stock build for peak trading, is up only \u00a35m vs March 2025\n\u00b7\nThis, in part, has funded a \u00a32m share buyback which was implemented in September 2025 and\ncompleted at prices well below the Board's view of intrinsic value\n. We continue to anticipate ongoing distributions in line with our previously communicated policy\nRecalibrate around a profitable core\nAdjusted EBITDAeil&ac of \u00a33.6m is up 112% on prior year (HY25: \u00a31.7m) in line with guidance for the full year; this results, in particular, from the application of rigorous Acquisition ROI targets in addition to cost optimisation across the P&L.\n\u00b7\nMarketing acquisition targets: as announced at the FY25 results, we are implementing a more robust acquisition ROI metric 'Acquisition Break-even'. Our target is to reach and exceed break-even on acquisition investment within 24 months.\nThis equates to a post-tax IRR of 23% and a 5-year forecast Payback of 1.7x\n\u00b7\nAcquisition Break-Even has improved from 75 months in HY25 to 44 months in HY26, reflecting:\no\nPrice increases in Australia and the UK coupled with improved margins globally, have driven circa 82% of this improvement, with further pricing anticipated in the US in Q4\no\nThe remaining improvements largely reflect the uplift in retention we have seen in the US and UK markets resulting from the focus on brand/engagement, and revised channel strategy\n\u00b7\nThe ongoing focus on cost will drive significant value in FY26 and beyond:\no\nThe IRR focus has generated in excess of \u00a35m of acquisition investment efficiencies in the first half\no\nGross Profit Margin improving to 19.5% (HY25: 16.9%) following ongoing cost saving actions including a focus on reduced acquisition cost, more than offsetting significant government regulations and tax increases from Duty, Packaging Taxes, and NI\no\nG&A costs (excluding adjusted items): a revised focus on G&A is a key lever to ensure that our investments deliver anticipated IRR targets. We continue to anticipate \u00a33m efficiencies, more than offsetting the estimated \u00a31m inflationary impact in the period\nPost Period End and Current Trading\n\u00b7\nPerformance continues to be in line with the communicated FY26 guidance, which supports progressive growth in adjusted EBITDA and significant cash generation for FY26\n\u00b7\nGross profit margin continues to improve, benefiting from the annualisation and compounding effect of cost efficiencies and pricing strategy.\n\u00b7\nLiquidation of excess inventory continuing as planned, supporting strong cash generation towards the target of \u00a340m over the medium term.\n\u00b7\nCommitted to ongoing distributions in line with the new Shareholder Distributions policy, currently engaged with finance partners on next share distributions.\n\u00b7\nRemain focused on disciplined return to organic revenue growth and executing on our Strategic Plan in the medium term, while also considering inorganic opportunities that drive shareholder value as they arise.\nFY26 guidance\n1\n:\n(reiterated, as communicated within the FY25 results published on 5 August 2025)\nKPI\nFY26\nRevenue\n\u00a3200m to \u00a3216m\nAdjusted EBITDA2 (excl. inventory liquidation and associated costs)\n\u00a35.5m to \u00a37.5m\nNet cash (excl. lease liabilities)3,4\n\u00a335m to \u00a339m\nInventory liquidations and associated costs5\n$17m (c.\u00a312m) of inventory liquidation cost over the Medium Term\n1.

In addition to statutory reporting, Naked Wines reports alternative performance measures (APMs) which are not defined or specified under the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards.

This reflects the impact of the normal decline of exceptional cohorts acquired in FY21 and FY22, the reduction in inefficient acquisition investment in late FY25 and FY26, and cautious consumer behaviour across the economy.\nRepeat Customer contribution dropped broadly in line with Repeat Customer sales. There was a 64% decline in New Customer sales on a constant currency basis, with investment in the acquisition of new customers reducing by 58% in HY26, in line with our redefined marketing strategy of removing inefficient spend.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) costs, excluding adjusted items, of \u00a314.6m were down 6% on prior year (HY25: \u00a315.7m), reflecting the impact of the cost savings implemented in April 2025. Statutory G&A costs of \u00a316.5m (HY25: \u00a315.8m) includes \u00a31.9m of the planned \u00a32m - \u00a33m restructuring costs we guided to at FY25 year end.\nThis resulted in adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation and associated costs of \u00a33.6m (HY25: \u00a31.7m). The adjusted EBITDA including inventory liquidation and associated costs was \u00a31.0m (HY25: loss of \u00a32.0m). The statutory loss before tax of \u00a33.0m (HY25: loss of \u00a35.6m) includes both the \u00a32.6m of inventory liquidation costs (HY25: \u00a33.7m) and \u00a32.5m of adjusted items (HY25: \u00a31.9m).\nAdjusted items\nHY26\n\u00a3m\nHY25\n\u00a3m\nRight-sizing of US inventory\n0.3\n-\nUnder-absorption of current year's winery overheads\n-\n(1.8)\nExtended Producer Responsibility levy for H2 FY26\n(0.8)\n-\nRestructuring costs\n(1.9)\n-\nFair value movement on forward foreign exchange contracts\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\nRefer to note 6 Adjusted items for further details of all these adjusted items. These are adjusted as they are either material one-time charges we do not expect to be repeated or they are non-trading related, or in the case of the Extended Producer Responsibility Levy, do not relate to the trading period under review. We feel that treating them as adjusted items provides clarity of these charges and also a more comparable view of business trading performance. Note that the Extended Producer Responsibility Levy will be reported within trading at the end of the year as the full year levy charge aligns with a full year of trading performance.\nCash flow drivers\nHY26 net cash excluding lease liabilities was \u00a331.1m, up \u00a38.2m on HY25 (HY25: \u00a322.9m) and up \u00a31m on March 2025 (\u00a330.1m). There was \u00a31.8m of net cash generation in HY26 (excluding the impact of FX) and including share distributions of \u00a32m. The adverse movement in inventory reflects some stock build ahead of Peak, which will reverse out in the second half.\nCash flow analysis\nHY26\n\u00a3m\nHY25\n\u00a3m\n(2.4)\n(5.0)\nAdd back: depreciation and amortisation\n1.0\n1.1\nAdd back: other non-cash amounts1\n(0.9)\n0.6\nChange in inventory\n(6.4)\n0.6\nChange in payables\n8.6\n1.0\nChange in Angel funds and other deferred income\n8.5\n7.7\nChange in receivables\n(2.2)\n1.8\nOperating cash flow\n6.2\n7.8\nNet tax received/(paid) and net interest paid\n-\n(2.4)\nCapital expenditure\n(1.5)\n(0.4)\nShare buyback\n(2.0)\n-\nRepayments of principal under lease liabilities\n(1.0)\n(0.8)\nMovement in net cash excluding lease liabilities\n1.8\n4.3\nOpening net cash excluding lease liabilities\n30.1\n19.6\nMovement in net cash excluding lease liabilities\n1.8\n4.3\nFX\n(0.7)\n(1.0)\nClosing net cash excluding lease liabilities\n31.1\n22.9\n1 Other non-cash amounts is made up of share-based payment charge of \u00a30.1m (HY25: \u00a30.8m), movement in inventory provision of credit of \u00a31.0m (HY25: \u00a30.3m) and fair value movement on foreign exchange contracts credit of \u00a30.1m (HY25:charge of \u00a30.1m).Due to rounding principles, numbers presented in \u00a3m may not sum to the totals provided. This can also lead to individual amounts being rounded to zero.\nNet interest charges totalled \u00a30.2m in HY26 (HY25: \u00a30.7m), being the net of interest receivable on cash at bank and funds placed on deposit and finance costs associated with the Group's asset-backed lending facilities.\nThe Group's statutory effective tax rate of (4.2)% (HY25: (16.1)%) is substantially driven by the Group's tax adjusted loss-making position in the UK and the US (in respect of which recognition of deferred tax is restricted) in contrast to the small profitable position in Australia, resulting in taxes to pay in this location.\nLiquidity and going concern\nThe Group has continued to build its net cash excluding lease liabilities position during HY26. Angel funds, which are heavily weighted to our core members who have been with the business for more than 24 months, have remained resilient during the period, reflecting the loyalty of our longer-term and most engaged members.\nThe combination of this improvement and the reduction in covenant limitations afforded by the credit facility, and the expectation of additional cash generation that is typical through the peak trading period, has improved the Group's resilience to weather any downturn. The Board has stress-tested a range of trading scenarios, which incorporate a range of inventory liquidation costs, and have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company will be able to operate within the level of their available liquidity. For this reason, and the reasons given above, the Board considers it appropriate for the Group and the Company to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.\nDominic

interim financial statements\n1. General Information\nNaked Wines plc (the Company) is a public limited company and is limited by shares. It is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and is registered in England and Wales. The Company is the ultimate controlling party of the Naked Group and its ordinary shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).\nThe Company's registered address is Norvic House, 29-33 Chapel Field Road, Norwich, NR2 1RP, UK. The Group's principal activity is the direct-to-consumer retailing of wine. The Company's principal activity is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared applying the accounting policies set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2025.\nThe auditor's report on those accounts was not qualified and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted for use in the UK. These should be read in conjunction with the group' last annual consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2025. They do not include all of the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transaction that are significant to an understanding of changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements.\nThe financial reporting period represents the 26 weeks ended 29 September 2025 and the prior period, 26 weeks ended 30 September 2024. The condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP which is the Group's functional currency and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (\u00a3'000), except when otherwise indicated.\nThe new accounting standards that came into effect in the current accounting period beginning 1 April 2025, noted below, did not have a material impact, nor introduce any new disclosures that are explicitly required in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nEffective date 1 January 2025\n\u00b7\nLack of Exchangeability - Amendments to\nIAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\nAt the reporting date, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective. The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed below will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.\nEffective date 1 January 2026\n\u00b7\nClassification and Measurement of Financial Instruments - Amendments to IFRS 9\nFinancial Instruments\nand IFRS 7\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures\n\u00b7\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards - Amendments to:\n\u00b7\nIFRS 1\nFirst-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards\n;\n\u00b7\nIFRS 7\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures\nand its accompanying\nGuidance on implementing IFRS 7\n;\n\u00b7\nIFRS 9\nFinancial Instruments\n;\n\u00b7\nIFRS 10\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n; and\n\u00b7\nIAS 7\nStatement of Cash flows\n\u00b7\nContracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7\nEffective date 1 January 2027\n\u00b7\nIFRS 18 Pre\nPresentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n\u00b7\nIFRS 19\nSubsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures\n\u00b7\nIFRS for SMES third edition (effective date is for the updated sections only)\nTo be determined\n\u00b7\nSale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28.\n3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nGoing concern\nIn concluding on the going concern basis of the financial statements, the Directors have made a number of judgments as set out in note 4 Going concern. The Directors draw attention to the critical nature of these estimates and judgements in the preparation of these financial statements.\nClassification of adjusted items\nA number of judgements are made in the presentation of costs and income as adjusted items. Refer to note 6 Adjusted items for further details.\nUS overstock inventory provision\nFor both bulk and cased wine inventory in the US, the full range of reasonably possible outcomes in a period of 12 months is inherently difficult to calculate as it is dependent on key assumptions, such as the expected future sales of wine and the use of the inventory in future wine projects. The Directors highlight, therefore, it is possible that outcomes within the next 12 months may differ from their estimates, and that the magnitude of the inventory provision in the Group's US business unit could materially change in the next financial year.\na) Bulk wine (gross inventory \u00a321.1m, overstock provision \u00a36.6m (FY25: gross inventory \u00a325.6m, overstock provision \u00a37.9m)).\nIf management are not able to realise expected proceeds for bulk wine expected to reach commercial expiry in the next 24 months, the inventory provision required for this inventory would increase by \u00a31.0m. However, were management to meet the upper end of its expectations of expected proceeds, the inventory provision required for this inventory would reduce by \u00a30.5m. Additionally, for every 10% of the remaining bulk wine on hand at the balance sheet date planned for bottling and sale in the normal course of business, which management subsequently could not use in future wine projects, but for which it could achieve expected secondary market disposal proceeds, a further \u00a30.7m increase in provision would be required.\nb) Cased wine (gross inventory \u00a352.6m, overstock provision \u00a31.9m, (FY25: gross inventory \u00a352.3m, overstock provision \u00a32.0m)).\nIn the event that cased wine held on the balance sheet reaches the end of its prime commercial life 12 months earlier than anticipated, the provision required for cased wine reaching expiry before sale would increase by \u00a31.5m.\nCapitalised development costs\nIn the first half of FY26, the Group capitalised \u00a31.3m (HY25: \u00a3nil, FY25: \u00a30.6m) of internally developed software as part of the digital transformation programme. Judgement is required in determining whether each individual workstream meets the recognition criteria for capitalisation as an intangible asset. In making this determination, management assess the stage of completion of each project, technical feasibility, the intention and ability to complete the software for use, the expected economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the project and the reliability of cost measurement.\nExpenditure that relates to research activities or does not clearly meet the criteria for capitalisation is expensed as incurred. Give the qualitative nature of these criteria, the capitalisation decision represents a significant judgement.\nOther sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe Group uses estimates of future profits to determine whether goodwill and other non-current assets should be impaired and the amount of deferred tax assets that are recognised at each balance sheet date. These are not considered significant sources of estimation in the current or prior period.\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, the Directors consider there are no further sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n4. Going concern\nIn order to assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, the Directors have prepared a number of cash flow scenarios extending for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements (\"the going concern assessment period\").\nBase case scenario\nIn its base case scenario, the Directors have used projected recent run rates of key performance indicators to forecast the cash flow of the business, taking into consideration current business initiatives and planned business improvement activities, and the funding available from existing cash reserves and the Group's 60-month credit facility with PNC Bank which is contracted to be available throughout and beyond the going concern assessment period. The Directors have also considered in their deliberations the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group as set out in the Group's FY25 annual report and accounts.\nUnder this scenario, the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the trading business and to exceed the springing covenant requirement of its credit facility throughout the going concern assessment period.\nSevere but plausible downside scenario\nThe Directors have then prepared a severe but plausible downside scenario incorporating a 5% and then 10% reduction in mature customer order frequency, resulting in a closing annualised 8% decline in repeat sales. This sensitivity scenario then incorporates available mitigating actions within management's control to both planned business initiatives as well as cost and cash saving opportunities within the operations of the business, including\n\u00b7\nReductions in new customer investment spend;\n\u00b7\nAutomatic and discretionary reductions in general and administrative costs, and\n\u00b7\nReduction in discretional in capital expenditure\nIn this severe but plausible downside scenario, the Group would maintain sufficient headroom in the going concern assessment period versus the springing covenant test requirement of $12m (around \u00a39m) of available liquidity.\nConclusion\nAfter considering the forecast, sensitivity and mitigating actions available and having regard to potential risks and uncertainties in its operating markets, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that Naked Wines has sufficient liquidity to trade and meet the obligations of its credit facility and therefore meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of the approval of these consolidated interim financial statements. For these reasons, the Board considers it appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\n5. Segmental reporting\nIFRS 8 Operating segments requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group's internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Board has determined that the Executive Directors of the Company are the CODM of the business. This is on the basis that they have primary responsibility for the allocation of resources between segments and the assessment of performance of the segments. In line with the information presented to the Executive Directors of the Company, the Group presents its segmental analysis based on the three geographic locations in which the Group operates.\nPerformance of these operating segments is assessed on revenue and adjusted EBIT (being operating profit excluding any adjusted items), as well as analysing the business between new customer, repeat customer and other lines of business.\nThese are the financial performance measures that are reported to the CODM, along with other operational performance measures, and are considered to be useful measures of the underlying trading performance of the segments. Adjusted items are allocated in accordance with how they are reported to the CODM.\nNow that we are operating under the new strategic plan announced in March 2025, the financial performance measures that are reported to the CODM, along with other operational performance measures remain consistent with previous financial periods and therefore no changes are required to the operating segments disclosed.\nThe table below sets out the basis on which the performance of the business is presented to the CODM. The CODM considers that, as a single route to market and solely consumer-facing business in three geographically and economically diverse locations, the business comprises three operating segments. The Group reports revenue from external customers as a single product group, being principally wine and some spirits.\nUnallocated assets include goodwill and other intangible assets held by holding companies and unallocated impairment charges relate to impairments recorded against these assets. For the purposes of the geographical analysis, these assets are allocated to the UK as these assets arose as a result of an acquisition by a UK holding company. For impairment analysis, these assets are allocated to the relevant CGU.\nUnallocated assets also include capitalised software development costs and unallocated amortisation relates to amortisation against these assets. These assets are unallocated for the purpose of the segmental disclosure as these are not included in the assets and liabilities reported to the CODM for each operating segment.\nCosts relating to global Group functions are not allocated to the operating segments for the purposes of assessing segmental performance and consequently global costs are presented separately. This is consistent with the presentation of those functions to the CODM.\nRevenues are attributed to the countries from which they are earned. The Group is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.\nAll revenue is recognised at a single point in time when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Specific to the Group, the performance obligations of the Group are deemed to be fulfilled when the product is delivered to our customer or Angel, typically within one to three days following dispatch, which is when the customer obtains control of their purchase and there is reasonable certainty regarding the recovery of the consideration.\nThe Group is subject to seasonal fluctuations resulting in varying profits over the full year period. The Group experiences increased sales in the third quarter which covers the holiday period, accounting for around 40% of total revenue compared to around 20% in each of the other quarters.\nIncluded within Angel funds and other deferred income is deferred income of \u00a36.3m (FY25: \u00a36.5m).

Adjusted\nEBITDA defined as adjusted EBIT, adding back depreciation and amortisation.\n6 Adjusted items\nThe Directors believe that adjusted EBIT provides additional useful information for shareholders on trends and performance. These measures are used for performance analysis. Adjusted EBIT is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies' adjusted profit measures. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit.\nThe adjustments made to reported loss before tax are:\n26 weeks ended\u00a029 September 2025\n26 weeks ended\u00a030 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n(a) Right-sizing of US inventory\nNet movement in US inventory provision\n522\n-\nLoss on the disposal of US inventory - contribution loss1\n(265)\n-\nRight-sizing of US inventory included in contribution\n257\n-\n(b) Under-absorption of current period's winery overheads\n-\n(1,798)\n(c) Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging\nfor second half of FY26\n(798)\n-\n(d) Restructuring costs\n(1,856)\n-\n(e) Other adjusted items:\nFair value movement on foreign exchange contracts and\nassociated unrealised foreign currency inventory\n(58)\n(108)\n(58)\n(108)\nTotal adjusted items\n(2,455)\n(1,906)\n1.\nContribution loss analysed as sales of \u00a30.1m (HY25: \u00a3nil) less cost of goods sold of \u00a30.4m (HY25: \u00a3nil) resulting in a net contribution loss of \u00a30.3m (HY25: \u00a3nil).\n(a)\nRight-sizing\nof US inventory\nAs a result of management's US inventory right-sizing exercise strategy, during HY26, the Group recorded a net credit of \u00a30.3m (HY25: \u00a3nil), reflecting the release and utilisation of the inventory provision created in prior years and a contribution loss of \u00a30.3m (analysed as sales of \u00a30.1m less cost of goods sold of \u00a30.4m),(HY25: \u00a3nil)) where inventory that was provided against has been sold on the secondary market as part this right-sizing exercise for less than historic cost of goods.\nThese amounts relate to purchases made on the basis of continued expected growth following the COVID pandemic and based on the Group's previous strategy of customer acquisition. As a result of the strategic shift from customer acquisition to short-term profitability and cash generation, this charge forms part of an exercise to better align purchasing and inventory management going forwards, whilst still ensuring the Group holds sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.\nManagement has concluded it is appropriate to include the provision, write off, release and utilisation within adjusted items to provide a more consistent basis with the comparative adjusted EBIT APM.\n(b)\nUnder-absorption of prior period's winery overheads\nAs a result of a reduction in the expected volume of wine to be produced by the Group's US business unit in the prior half year, the Group was unable to allocate all of the associated wine production overhead costs into the wine produced. Per the relevant accounting standard (IAS 2 Inventories), unallocated overheads as a result of low production must be expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The charge reported at \u00a3nil for HY26 and \u00a31.8m for HY25 includes both the under-absorption of incurred production costs to date and a provision for the remainder of an onerous third-party production cost relating to prior period production.\n(c)\nExtended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging for second half of FY26\nEPR is a new levy on UK companies that supply or import packaging. The obligating event for the first year of the levy is meeting the definition of a producer at any time during the assessment year commencing on 1 April 2025, at which point the liability of \u00a31.6m is recognised in full. The charge of \u00a30.8m (HY25: \u00a3nil) relating to the second half of the financial year has been disclosed within adjusted items. The second half liability reported here\u00a0will be reported within adjusted EBIT at the end of FY26 as the full year levy charge aligns with a full year of trading performance.\n(d)\nRestructuring costs\nOne of the key elements in the new strategic plan was to organise the Group as one global team, with the resultant team reorganisation announced at the beginning of FY26. As such, the Group incurred one-off termination payments and associated costs amounting to \u00a31.9m (HY25:\n\u00a3\nnil).\n(e)\nOther adjusted items\nFair value movement on foreign exchange contracts and associated unrealised foreign currency inventory\nThe Group commits in advance to buying foreign currency to purchase wine to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. UK-adopted international accounting standards require us to mark the value of these contracts to market at each balance sheet date. As this may materially fluctuate, we adjust this, and associated foreign currency inventory revaluation, so as to reflect our trading profitability on a more consistent basis.\n7 Tax\nTax for the 26 weeks ended 29 September 2025 is charged at an effective tax rate of (4.2)% (HY25: (16.1)%) representing the best estimate of the Group's expected annual effective tax rate, applied to the profit before tax of the period. The main contributors to this effective tax rate are the Group's tax adjusted loss-making position in the UK and the US (in respect of which recognition of deferred tax is restricted) in contrast to the small profitable position in Australia, resulting in taxes to pay in this location.\n26 weeks ended\u00a029 September 2025\n26 weeks ended\u00a030 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCurrent tax charge\n(111)\n(183)\nDeferred tax\nChange in UK deferred tax asset recognition\n(2)\n(177)\nChange in US deferred tax asset recognition\n(13)\n(551)\nOther deferred tax movements\n-\n4\nDeferred tax charge\n(15)\n(724)\nTotal tax charge for the period recognised in the income statement\n(126)\n(907)\nEffective tax rate\n(4.2)%\n(16.1)%\nUS Bill Act Enactment\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, or the 2025 Tax Act, enacted on 5 July 2025 makes changes to U.S. corporate income taxes including reinstating the option to claim 100% accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property, with retroactive application beginning 20 January 2025 and modifications to the interest expense limitation rules under Section 163(j). Naked Wines does not expect that the enactment of the 2025 Tax Act will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations but will account for it as applicable.\n8 Loss per share\nBasic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue of the Company, excluding 129,547 (HY25: 137,298) shares held by the Naked Wines plc Share Incentive Plan Trust and the Naked Wines Employee Benefit Trust (which have been treated as dilutive share-based payment awards).\nThe dilutive effect of share-based payment awards is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Share options granted over 28,084 (HY25: 830,701) ordinary shares have been excluded from the calculation as they are anti-dilutive. There are no outstanding share awards that are potentially dilutive at the year end.\n26 weeks ended\u00a029 September 2025\n26 weeks ended\u00a030 September 2024\nBasic and diluted loss per share (pence)\n(4.3)p\n(8.8)p\nLoss for the purposes of basic earnings per share calculation (\u00a3'000)\n(3,142)\n(6,525)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating basic earnings per share\n73,456,779\n73,844,059\nDilutive potential ordinary shares:\nEmployee share awards\n2,818,181\n652,709\nWeighted average number of shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share\n76,274,960\n74,496,768\nTotal number of shares in issue\n71,717,079\n74,004,135\nAs noted above, the denominator for the purposes of calculating both basic and diluted loss per share has been adjusted to exclude the shares held by the Naked Wines plc Share Incentive Plan Trust and the Naked Wines Employee Benefit Trust.\nIf all the Company's share option schemes had vested at 100%, the Company would have 75,788,226 issued shares (HY25: 78,727,032).\n9\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill\nFacilities and trademarks\nCustomer lists\nBrands\nSoftware\nInternally generated software\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCost\nAt 1 April 2024\n31,004\n1,607\n14,300\n10,100\n2,480\n-\n59,491\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n579\n579\nForeign currency\n(609)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(609)\nAt 31 March 2025\n30,395\n1,607\n14,300\n10,100\n2,480\n579\n59,461\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,270\n1,270\nForeign currency\n(854)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(854)\nAt 30 September 2025\n29,541\n1,607\n14,300\n10,100\n2,480\n1,849\n59,877\nAccumulated amortisation\nAt 1 April 2024\n(25,145)\n(1,607)\n(14,300)\n(10,100)\n(2,480)\n-\n(53,632)\nForeign currency\n609\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n609\nAt 31 March 2025\n(24,536)\n(1,607)\n(14,300)\n(10,100)\n(2,480)\n-\n(53,023)\nCharge for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(72)\n(72)\nForeign currency\n854\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n854\nAt 30 September 2025\n(23,682)\n(1,607)\n(14,300)\n(10,100)\n(2,480)\n(72)\n(52,241)\nNet book value\nAt 30 September 2025\n5,859\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,777\n7,636\nAt 31 March 2025\n5,859\n-\n-\n-\n-\n579\n6,438\nAt 1 April 2024\n5,859\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5,859\nIn the first half of FY26, the Group invested \u00a31.3m (HY25: \u00a3nil, FY25: \u00a30.6m) as part of the digital transformation programme.
