EBITDA\neil&ac 1\nsignificantly ahead of prior year, with performance in line with full year guidance\"\nOverview:\nHY26 delivered significant progress, including improved adjusted EBITDA\neilac\n1\nand Gross Profit Margin, cash generation and delivery against the KPIs set out in the new Strategic Plan articulated in March 2025. The Company also successfully completed its first share buyback programme, which we believe has increased intrinsic value per share for all remaining shareholders.\nThe Board and Leadership team have been strengthened, with Jack Pailing moving to Non-Executive Chair, Jan-Hendrik Mohr joining as Non-Executive Director, and David Atchison providing Board advisory support focused on advancing our marketing strategy and customer growth initiatives. Performance is continuing in line with FY26 guidance, which supports our medium term\n2\ngoals of progressive growth in adj. EBITDA\neil&ac\n, continued cash generation, and recalibrating revenue around our highly profitable core.\nFinancial Highlights:\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\neil&ac\nof \u00a33.6m up 112% on prior year (HY25: \u00a31.7m), comfortably within guidance for the full year\n\u00b7\nNet Cash excluding lease liabilities up \u00a38.2m to \u00a331.1m vs prior year (HY25: \u00a322.9m), reflecting \u00a310m of cash generation less the \u00a32m share buyback completed in September 2025, and up \u00a31m vs March 2025\n\u00b7\nRevenue of \u00a389.5m (HY25: reported \u00a3112.3m, constant currency \u00a3108.9m) reducing in line with communicated FY26 guidance and our strategy of recalibrating around our highly profitable Core Members (-18% constant FX / -20% actual FX); this reflects the impact of the normal decline of exceptional cohorts acquired in FY21 and FY22, the removal of inefficient acquisition investment in late FY25 and FY26, and cautious consumer behaviour across the economy\n\u00b7\nStatutory loss before tax reduced to \u00a33.0m (HY25: loss of \u00a35.6m), after \u00a32.5m of adjusted items (HY25: \u00a31.9m) and \u00a32.6m of the communicated $17m/\u00a312m medium term inventory liquidation and associated costs (HY25: \u00a33.7m)\nDelivering on our Strategic Plan:\nRelease cash tied up on the balance sheet:\n\u00b7\nFree Cash Flow of \u00a34.7m versus \u00a37.4m for prior year, primarily driven by cash generation through payables and Angel funds offset by cash consumption through inventory, as we stock build for peak as planned but at higher levels than prior year\n\u00b7\nFirst share buyback programme under our new Capital Allocation Policy successfully completed, with \u00a32m purchased at prices well below the Board's view of intrinsic value\n\u00b7\nReturn On Equity and Cash of 11% versus 5% in HY25, largely driven by the significant growth in adjusted EBITDA\neil&ac\nRecalibrate around a profitable core:\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\neil&ac\nof \u00a33.6m up 112% on prior year (HY25: \u00a31.7m), in line with guidance for the full year\n\u00b7\nGross Profit Margin improving to 19.5% (HY25: 16.9%): 50%\n3\nof this driven by price increases and cost savings such as reduced acquisition cost; with the balance largely reflecting higher FY25 inventory costs\n\u00b7\nAs communicated in August, we have now determined our replacement metric for 'Payback': Acquisition Break-even months. The target for this is break-even on acquisition investment within 24 months, which equates to a post-tax IRR of 23% and a 5-year forecast payback of 1.7x\n1 adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation and associated costs\n2 Medium Term = 3 - 5 years\n3 the balance of the margin improvement reflected changes in inventory movements\nReturn to sustainable growth:\n\u00b7\nCore Members (customers who have been with us for more than two years) remain both highly profitable and deeply engaged, with key satisfaction and retention metrics continuing to be strong. Customer Net Promoter Score* (NPS) of 76, rated 'excellent', was consistent with the prior year. Member Retention Rate* held strong vs prior year at 76%, representing a 100 bps improvement on the FY25 close (75%)\n\u00b7\nCustomer acquisition investment was reduced to \u00a33.9m (HY25: \u00a39.4m) as a result of removing inefficient spend in line with our redefined marketing strategy, as previously communicated this will lead to a smaller more profitable business\n\u00b7\nDemonstrable progress being made on Acquisition Break-even*, falling from 75 months in HY25 to\n44\nmonths in the 5 months to August 2025**; this reflects improved channel management, reduced Customer Acquisition Cost (\u00a369 from \u00a378), and gross profit margin improvement (19.5% vs 16.9%)\n\u00b7\nInitial revenue coming from new US growth opportunities. The recently acquired Sonoma winery, established to generate manufacturing and storage savings, also provides the opportunity for new sales in custom crush and bulk storage. Going forward we also see opportunities in private label production.\nPost Period End and Current Trading:\n\u00b7\nPerformance con",

Under these arrangements, Panmure Liberum will make trading decisions in relation to the buyback of the Group's ordinary shares of 7.5 pence each independently of the Group within the programme terms and pre-set parameters.\nIn line with the authority given at the 2024 AGM, the maximum price per Ordinary Share (exclusive of exepnses) may not exceed the higher of 105 per cent of the average middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Ordinary Share is purchased; an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share; and the highest current independent purchase bid for an ordinary share on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out at the relevant time, including when shares are traded on different venues.\nAll ordinary shares repurchased by the Group under the Share Buyback Programme will be cancelled.\nShares purchased under the Share Buyback Programme will continue to take place in open market transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price and trading volumes. The Share Buyback Programme will be effected under the authority granted by shareholders at the Group's September 2024 Annual General Meeting (\"\nAGM\"\n) to purchase a maximum of 7,400,413 Ordinary Shares. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company in September 2025, however the Board intend to seek renewal of this power at its 2025 AGM.\nThe Share Buyback Programme will be conducted within the parameters of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU as it forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended and the delegated regulations made pursuant to it, save that there may be circumstances where the Company conducts share repurchases such that they exceed 25 per cent (but not more than 50 per cent) of the average daily volume in Ordinary Shares for the 20 trading days prior to the share repurchase (the \"\nVolume Limit\n\").\nAccordingly, the Group may not benefit from the exemption contained in Article 5(1) of MAR in these circumstances. The Volume Limit may be exceeded should Panmure Liberum consider, at its discretion, that an opportunity has arisen to acquire a significant number of shares in one trade. In such circumstances, an announcement of the purchase will be made as soon as possible following such trade taking place.\nThe Group has authorised the Share Buyback Programme to commence from today and will continue until the earlier of: the date on which the Maximum Amount payable by the Company has been reached, or 4 November 2025, conditional on the share buyback authority being renewed at the Company's 2025 AGM.\nAny market purchase of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Programme will be announced no later than 7:30am (UK time) on the business day following the day on which the purchase occurred.\nThe Group confirms that it currently has no unpublished price sensitive information.\nFor further information, please contact:\nNaked Wines plc\nRodrigo Maza, Chief Executive Officer\nDominic Neary, Chief Financial Officer\nCatherine Miles / Libby Bundock\nIR@nakedwines.com\nInvestec (Nomad & Joint Broker)\nDavid Flin\nTel: 0207 597 5970\nPanmure Liberum (Joint Broker)\nEd Thomas / John More / Dru Danford\nTel: 0203 100 2222\nVigo Consulting (Financial PR)\nTim McCall / Guy Scarborough / Damian Reece\nTel: 0207 390 0230\nAbout Naked Wines\nNaked Wines\nis not just an online wine retailer; we're trailblazers on a mission to enable enthusiastic wine drinkers to enjoy great wine without the guesswork.Founded in 2008, on the pillars of quality, choice and fair pricing, we set out to create the most inclusive wine club in the world - dedicated to transforming the wine-buying experience and empowering people to make their own wine choices, and championing world-class independent winemakers.

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price. Hence, we increase TP to 150p from 50p. BUY",

Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

They have set themselves a task so there'll be a lot more attention now to the delivery but the price is still less than their projected 1-yr cash target so plenty of upside still to come. I wish I were bold enough to add to my modest holding here but for now we have very little data on trading ranges which I want to see before I start to adding. Now that I am confident they are operating on a sound footing, I don't mind holding the occasional overweight position to earn a little extra dividend. For now, I will probably consider upgrading my status to Angel given that the shares have paid for over a year's supply of good wine and are more likely than not to continue doing so.",

And what do you think happens to wine prices in the EU & the UK when the EU can't sell wine to the US? They will plummet because the EU will have to dump wine into the UK and other markets instead, lowering the price. The CEO even commented recently how tarrifs are not good for them.

Brown noted that it is now free cashflow positive and the company has a plan to achieve three things: significantly build cash on the balance sheet to more than \u00a3100m over the next five years; return the business to 5-10% revenue growth while underpinning earnings at \u00a310m in the near-term; and commit to distributing this cash to shareholders. \u2018All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth,\u2019 said Brown. \u2018With cash much greater than the current market cap of \u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price.\u2019 The shares were trading up 28% at 80.5p on Thursday afternoon, and have risen 40% over one year.",

Given their huge inventory issues & the trump tarrifs threat, this will make EU wine worth signficantly less as the market prices that in, you can expect more impariments to happen. - Panmure has a conflict of interest as it's hired by the company, so their price target is just meaningless. If tarrifs don't happen, then Wine will be great, if they do happen soon, then Wine looks to be in serious trouble imo, EU producers will dump their wine into other markets like the UK & Australia, Wine's US share of revenue will go down immediately until they can source more wine from non-EU countries maybe.",

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price.

Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

They have set themselves a task so there'll be a lot more attention now to the delivery but the price is still less than their projected 1-yr cash target so plenty of upside still to come. I wish I were bold enough to add to my modest holding here but for now we have very little data on trading ranges which I want to see before I start to adding. Now that I am confident they are operating on a sound footing, I don't mind holding the occasional overweight position to earn a little extra dividend. For now, I will probably consider upgrading my status to Angel given that the shares have paid for over a year's supply of good wine and are more likely than not to continue doing so.",

And what do you think happens to wine prices in the EU & the UK when the EU can't sell wine to the US? They will plummet because the EU will have to dump wine into the UK and other markets instead, lowering the price. The CEO even commented recently how tarrifs are not good for them. I fail to see why this has risen given this massive risk & oversupply of Wine worldwide, probably will drop when freedom day tarrifs come in.",

Brown noted that it is now free cashflow positive and the company has a plan to achieve three things: significantly build cash on the balance sheet to more than \u00a3100m over the next five years; return the business to 5-10% revenue growth while underpinning earnings at \u00a310m in the near-term; and commit to distributing this cash to shareholders. \u2018All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth,\u2019 said Brown. \u2018With cash much greater than the current market cap of \u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price.\u2019 The shares were trading up 28% at 80.5p on Thursday afternoon, and have risen 40% over one year.",

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price. Hence, we increase TP to 150p from 50p. BUY",

For my part, I squirrelled away a few of these in my 2025/26 ISA though recouped around 60% of the costs through selling the ones I bought around two weeks ago in my GIA. Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

The decline in revenue remained consistent with the prior reporting period and guidance, reflecting the strategy of recalibrating around the profitable core, while average order value and revenue per member were ahead on a constant currency basis.\nPeak Season Trading:\n\u00b7\nRevenue declined by -19% at constant currency vs prior year (-21% vs reported), in line with expectations, including repeat sales which were down -16% at constant currency (-18% vs reported)\n\u00b7\nAverage order value increased by 5% at constant currency (4% vs reported)\n\u00b7\nRevenue per member increased by 1% at constant currency (-1% vs reported)\nCommenting on the peak season trading, Rodrigo Maza, CEO, said:\n\"Peak season trading has been pleasing, reflecting the hard work by all our teams to deliver for customers and the focus on our unique customer proposition. We continue to make good progress against our strategic KPIs and remain committed to delivering shareholder value. Current trading is in line with guidance, and we look forward to providing a more detailed update in our full year trading update at the end of April.\"\nIssued Share Capital:\nFollowing the share buyback in December 2025, and as at the date of this announcement, the Company's total issued ordinary share capital is 71,717,079, with 2,766,665 ordinary shares held in treasury, and the total number of voting rights in the Company is 68,950,414. The figure of 68,950,414 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company, under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.\nFY26 guidance\n1\n:\nKPI\nFY26\nRevenue\n\u00a3200m to \u00a3216m\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\n(excl. inventory liquidation and associated costs)\n\u00a35.5m to \u00a37.5m\nNet cash (excl. lease liabilities)\n3,4\n\u00a333m to \u00a335m\nInventory liquidations and associated costs\n5\nc.$17m of inventory liquidation cost over the Medium Term\n1. This guidance has been provided based on constant FX rates of 1 GBP = 1.35 USD and 2.00 AUD\n2. As highlighted in March 2025, implementing the \u00a315m of FY26 savings results in a likely \u00a32-\u00a33m exceptional cost throughout FY26\n3. Net cash (excl. lease liabilities); the amount of cash we are holding less borrowings at year end excluding lease liabilities\n4.

For my part, I squirrelled away a few of these in my 2025/26 ISA though recouped around 60% of the costs through selling the ones I bought around two weeks ago in my GIA. Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

I found some room in this year's ISA for around 4000 shares and they look good to hold for the medium term. I sold some of the shares in the GIA today, largely to manage exposures, so missed out on a little bonus from the late afternoon price rise. I'm not entirely convinced that the broader market is pricing correctly the Trump tariffs so wanted to top up the coffers for round 2 of proceedings.   Round 1 was perfectly timed for ISA investors.",

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price.

Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

Under these arrangements, Panmure Liberum will make trading decisions in relation to the buyback of the Group's ordinary shares of 7.5 pence each independently of the Group within the programme terms and pre-set parameters.\nIn line with the authority given at the 2025 AGM, the maximum price per Ordinary Share (exclusive of expenses) may not exceed the higher of 105 per cent of the average middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Ordinary Share is purchased; an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share; and the highest current independent purchase bid for an ordinary share on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out at the relevant time, including when shares are traded on different venues.\nAll Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Group under the Share Buyback Programme will be held in treasury. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and do not participate in dividends.\nShare purchases under the Share Buyback Programme will continue to take place in open market transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price and trading volumes. The Share Buyback Programme will be effected under the authority granted by shareholders at the Group's September 2025 Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") to purchase a maximum of 7,400,413 Ordinary Shares, under which authority to purchase 4,281,192 Ordinary Shares remains.\nShareholders should be aware that given all Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Group under the Share Buyback Programme will be held in treasury, and given the Share Buyback Programme may on any given trading day represent a significant portion of the daily traded volume in the Group's Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange, and the Group expects daily volumes to exceed 25% of the average daily traded volume on the London Stock Exchange. Accordingly, the Group will not benefit from the exemption contained in Article 5(1) of MAR.\nOutside of the above, the Share Buyback Programme will be conducted in accordance with the other safe harbour parameters as prescribed by MAR insofar as possible. The Group has authorised the Share Buyback Programme to commence from today and will continue until the earlier of: the date on which the Maximum Amount payable by the Company has been reached, or 31st March 2026.\nAny market purchase of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Programme will be announced no later than 7:30am (UK time) on the business day following the day on which the purchase occurred.\nThe Group confirms that it currently has no unpublished price sensitive information.\nOngoing capital distributions policy\nThe Company's aim with regards to ongoing capital distributions is to return up to 50% of adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory liquidation costs or the increase in net cash (excluding shareholder distributions), whichever is lower, subject to the Board's assessment of the Group's financial position, liquidity requirements and investment opportunities.\nConsistent with previous communications, the Company also intends to return additional capital through ad hoc share buybacks over and above this as the Board judges to be in the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Share Buyback Programme announced today is an additional ad hoc distribution, separate to the Company's ongoing capital distribution policy that has, and will continue to, be applied.\nThe Board will continue to keep capital allocation under review and will update shareholders as appropriate.\nFor further information, please contact:\nNaked Wines plc\nRodrigo Maza, Chief Executive Officer\nDominic Neary, Chief Financial Officer\nCatherine Miles, Investor Relations\nIR@nakedwines.com\nPanmure Liberum (NOMAD and Broker)\nEd Thomas / John More / Dru Danford\nTel: 0203 100 2222\nVigo Consulting (Financial PR)\nTim McCall / Guy Scarborough / Damian Reece\nTel: 0207 390 0230\nAbout Naked Wines\nNaked Wines\nis not just an online wine retailer; we're trailblazers on a mission to enable enthusiastic wine drinkers to enjoy great wine without the guesswork.\nFounded in 2008, on the pillars of quality, choice and fair pricing, we set ou",

For my part, I squirrelled away a few of these in my 2025/26 ISA though recouped around 60% of the costs through selling the ones I bought around two weeks ago in my GIA. Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price.

For my part, I squirrelled away a few of these in my 2025/26 ISA though recouped around 60% of the costs through selling the ones I bought around two weeks ago in my GIA. Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

For my part, I squirrelled away a few of these in my 2025/26 ISA though recouped around 60% of the costs through selling the ones I bought around two weeks ago in my GIA. Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price. Hence, we increase TP to 150p from 50p. BUY",

For my part, I squirrelled away a few of these in my 2025/26 ISA though recouped around 60% of the costs through selling the ones I bought around two weeks ago in my GIA. Took a bit of time to get the right prices and I was overweight for around 24 hours but target thresholds are only rules of thumb and I have the long term confidence in the company that I don't have any problem being stuck with a few extra shares if Trump were to come out with another brainfart. I would perhaps consider the target audience of Naked Wines. These are quality wines that WINE will be selling to the comfortably-affluent American rather than the bud-drinking core Trump base. For a comparison, maybe look at MKS and how their shares reacted this week, and you'll perhaps see why WINE will have some level of protection from the trade winds unleashed these last few weeks. The biggest threat may even be from a potential oversupply of better wines if the US finds it has too much but those tend to operate in a very different market and I suspect the high-quality wines from California et.al. would react here by holding back supply rather than flooding the market.",

All this is being achieved while improving returns, and deploying a new marketing plan that offers the opportunity to deliver sustainable growth. With cash (c.\u00a333m on the B/S now + selling excess inventory of \u00a340m) much greater than the current market cap of c.\u00a345m we see huge upside to the share price.
