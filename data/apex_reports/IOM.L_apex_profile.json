Which means we can bring the latest technologies in hybrid cloud, data protection, and cyber resiliency to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nFor further information about the Group, please visit\nwww.iomart.com\nHalf Year Statement\nIntroduction\nThis half year has been one of significant transition and strategic realignment for the Group, as we refreshed our leadership structure and sharpened our focus on the distinct strengths of our core business units. These changes have been implemented with a clear objective: to ensure accountability, foster specialist expertise and to better serve the diverse needs of our customers across the portfolio.\nOur financial performance for the first half of the year, while a reduction from the prior year, is in line with the Board's expectations and consistent with the pre-close trading update issued on 30 October 2025. We have made tangible progress in strengthening our operational foundations, simplifying our business model and positioning Iomart for sustainable growth.\nWe have made important strides in operational efficiency, delivering the initial phase of our cost optimisation programme and achieving annualised savings to date of \u00a34m, that will benefit the Group's financial results in the second half and beyond. Our investment in technology, people and process improvements is yielding results, as evidenced by strong order bookings, improved customer retention and the expansion of our capabilities in high-growth areas such as managed security.\nOur Business Model\nOur vision remains clear and consistent; to establish Iomart as the UK's leading provider of secure cloud services for the SME and enterprise mid-market.\nOver recent months, we have strengthened our focus on three core business units, each now led by dedicated leadership teams. This structure is supported by a group-wide sales and marketing function serving both new and existing customers, alongside centralised support functions in finance, procurement, compliance and HR, to ensure strong governance and efficiency. In addition, our captive offshore operations in India now provide scalable expertise across all three business units and central functions, delivering ability to scale the business but also as a means of delivering substantial improvement in business efficiency and thereby driving down our costs.\nDuring the past six months, we have implemented several changes within our Business Units, as outlined below:\n\u00b7\nDomain & Mass Hosting (Easyspace)\nThe Sonassi brand, specialising in eCommerce hosting, has been integrated with Easyspace and Hosting UK to form a unified domain and hosting business. This consolidation creates a comprehensive portfolio of end-to-end web hosting solutions for UK consumers and SMEs. The three brands, Easyspace, Hosting UK and Sonassi, remain distinct, to reflect differing customer needs and technical requirements. Some additional customer cohorts from legacy Iomart self-managed infrastructure brands have also migrated to Hosting UK.\n\u00b7\nIomart Cloud Services\nOur largest business unit continues to provide private cloud, backup and data protection solutions, and data centre services to a diverse customer base across multiple sectors. These services are underpinned by strong technology partnerships, including Broadcom Pinnacle Partner for VMware Cloud and Elite MSP partner for Commvault. Integration efforts have consolidated previous acquisitions and brands under Iomart, Oriium (data protection centre of excellence and channel partner) and Rapidswitch (dedicated servers). Earlier this year, we transitioned Extrinsica operations to Atech, consolidating Microsoft solution delivery. The remaining approximately \u00a37m (annualised) of Microsoft-related revenue within Iomart Cloud Services will start to migrate to Atech in the coming months.\n\u00b7\nAtech\nAtech is now firmly established as our Microsoft (Azure, Modern Work and AI) and Security practice, operating under a single management structure and centre of excellence. It is one of the UK's most accredited Microsoft managed service partners, enhancing our ability to win new business and serve the entire Group customer base. Approximately 30% of Group revenue now comes from Microsoft-connected activities (H1 FY25: 9%).\nThese changes have delivered greater clarity, focus, and alignment with the unique characteristics, maturity cycle and technical requirements of each business unit. The impact of the above revenue reclassification on prior period segmental reporting is covered in note 12.\nStrategy and operational highlights\nFirst half highlights\nBeyond the success of creating greater clarity, focus, and alignment across our business units, notable highlights in the first half of the year include:\n\u00b7\nStrong Order Bookings and Sales Transformation\nWe secured an additional \u00a310m in annual recurring revenue (ARR) bookings in the first six months, supported by a growing pipeline (H1 FY25: \u00a39.6m). Our revised sales strategy and operating model are designed to drive consultancy-led engagements into targeted verticals, and we are now seeing larger ARR opportunities emerging. To enable this, we have upskilled our sales team, improving certifications and accreditations across our three strategic vendor technologies. We have also deployed a new Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) system, simplifying quoting and billing processes.\n\u00b7\nExpansion of Microsoft & Security Capabilities through Atech\nSince acquisition, Atech has secured a further four advanced specialisations, including in Copilot, making us one of the first UK partners to achieve this. We have also been awarded two new Solution Partner designations in Private Cloud and Hybrid Cloud, cementing Atech's position as one of the most accredited Microsoft partners in the UK.\n\u00b7\nCustomer Alignment and Operational Simplification\nWe have improved alignment of legacy brand customer bases to our simplified business model, ensuring all Iomart Cloud Services customers with managed services are now centralised into a single Iomart ERP system and service teams. This integration provides clarity and efficiency, while Rapidswitch retains a clear focus on the dedicated servers market.\n\u00b7\nTechnology Advancement\nWe completed the deployment of the new Broadcom vCloud Director platform, delivering best-in-class private cloud functionality and strengthening our technology offering.\n\u00b7\nCost Optimisation Programme\nWe delivered the initial phase of our cost optimisation programme, achieving \u00a34m in annualised savings through headcount reductions, infrastructure decommissioning, procurement efficiencies, and expansion of our captive offshore operations in India (headcount now at 73 employees), which will\nbenefit H2 and onwards.\nSecond half priorities\nOur priorities for the second half of the year are centred on accelerating profitable revenue growth, improving operational efficiency and strengthening our financial position. The key areas of focus are:\n\u00b7\nRevenue Growth Initiatives\nWe aim to position the Group strongly for an improved starting point, in terms of monthly recurring revenue, as we enter FY27. Key actions include:\no\nOnboarding managed security customers: Accelerate the acquisition and integration of managed security clients, leveraging Atech's Microsoft and security expertise to capture high-margin recurring revenue streams.\no\nProductisation of AI Services: Formalise and launch our AI-driven service offerings, creating packaged solutions that address customer needs for automation, optimisation and intelligent security.\no\nMaximising Indirect Channel sales via Oriium: Optimising potential of our channel partner network through the Oriium brand and partnerships with the IT channel.\no\nLeveraging Broadcom Pinnacle Partner status: Differentiate our private cloud hosting capabilities by capitalising on our Elite Partner status, positioning Iomart as a trusted provider for VMware Cloud solutions.\no\nIncremental customer growth in data centre services: Target new customers for colocation and dedicated hosting services, particularly within Rapidswitch, to enhance utilisation and margin contribution\n.\n\u00b7\nCost Optimisation and Operational Efficiency\nWe will continue our rolling programme of cost optimisation, with a focus on:\no\nReducing structural data centre costs: over the medium-term address fixed cost structures through consolidation of facilities and improved energy efficiency factors and utilisation rates.\no\nDriving efficiency across operations: Implement process & system improvements (including AI and automation), alongside investing in our Indian team to allow the business to scale efficiently, while maintaining service quality.\n\u00b7\nFinancial Position\nOur focus is to manage effectively our financial position through:\no\nPositive cash generation and the delivery of strong cash flow in H2.\no\nContinued cost optimisation and disciplined working capital management.\no\nMaintaining financial flexibility to ensure the Group is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives while reducing net debt leverage levels.\nTogether, these actions will enable Iomart to enter FY27 with a stronger revenue base and a more robust financial position, setting the foundation for sustainable growth.\nMarket Update\nThe UK cloud computing market has continued to demonstrate growth over the past six months, underpinned by accelerating digital transformation, heightened security requirements and the integration of AI-driven capabilities. Public cloud adoption remains dominant, with Microsoft Azure maintaining a leading position in the UK enterprise segment. However, hybrid and multi-cloud strategies remain a prevailing model, as organisations seek flexibility, resilience and compliance with data sovereignty regulations.\nKey market dynamics and how we are responding:\n\u00b7\nHybrid cloud adoption: UK businesses increasingly operate across both public and private cloud environments, driven by regulatory compliance, cost optimisation and the need for operational resilience. Persistent cost challenges, including energy and infrastructure expenses, are accelerating migration away from on-premise systems toward cloud-native and hybrid solutions. This is our heritage. We have proven capabilities in managing this complex landscape for a range of UK businesses.\n\u00b7\nAI and Automation: Demand for AI-enabled services is reshaping cloud strategies, with enterprises prioritising platforms that deliver automation, predictive analytics and enhanced security. Through our recent innovation in this space, we are launching a range of offerings in H2 to make our products in this space more easily accessible.\n\u00b7\nSecurity and Compliance: Rising cyber threats and sector-specific regulations are reinforcing the need for cyber consultancy, incident response managed cyber security services and zero-trust architectures. We have further expanded our 24/7 Security Operations Centre (SOC) and cyber advisory offerings, strengthening our capabilities in cyber security.\nWe have seen customers adopt a more conservative approach to technology investment, prioritising essential services such as security, compliance and cost optimisation over discretionary projects. Outsourcing to managed service providers delivers capability to reduce capital expenditure and improve cost control.\nIomart is offsetting margin pressure in commoditising areas such as licence consumption by accelerating our drive to ensure differentiation through high-value offerings such as security and managed services, optimising customer costs and compliance.\nWe are now able to offer hybrid solutions, combining Microsoft public cloud services (Azure infrastructure, Modern Work, and Security) expertise, along with our strong heritage in private cloud infrastructure, making us well positioned in the market.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n20241\n20251\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nIomart Cloud Services\n44,504\n49,445\n97,059\nAtech\n25,565\n4,350\n30,188\nDomain and Mass Hosting (Easyspace)\n7,676\n8,155\n16,213\nTotal revenue\n77,745\n61,950\n143,460\n1\nsee note 12 for reclassification of historic periods.\nOverall revenue from our operations was \u00a377.7m (H1 2025: \u00a362.0m) with a high level of recurring revenue at 86% (H1 2025: 91%). We remain focused on retaining our recurring revenue business model with the combination of multi-year contracts and payments in advance providing us with good revenue visibility. The Atech acquisition reduced the percentage of recurring revenue due to a higher proportion of consultancy activity as we support customers in their digital migrations and security positioning.\nGroup revenue includes a full six months of revenue from Atech, being \u00a321.7m, growth of 16% on the comparable period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the remaining pre-existing Group experienced a revenue decline of around \u00a36.0m, reflecting the accelerated churn of customers from legacy self-managed infrastructure, plus some private managed cloud customers, in the prior year which impacted the monthly run rate entering into this current financial year. A key success in the current period has been the consistent delivery of positive net order bookings driven by a combination of a good level of new orders bookings of \u00a310m annual recurring revenue (H1 2025: \u00a310m) and an improvement in customer renewal rates allowing achievement of net order bookings7 of \u00a34.5m ARR (H1 2025: \u00a30.3m).\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the year ended 31 March\nFor the six months ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n1\n2025\n1\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nIomart Cloud Services\n9,091\n15,054\n27,460\nAtech\n2,581\n(173)\n3,067\nDomain and Mass Hosting (Easyspace)\n3,886\n4,513\n8,562\nGroup overheads\n(2,648)\n(2,442)\n(4,777)\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n12,910\n16,952\n34,312\n1\nsee note 12 for reclassification of historic periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA(2) was \u00a312.9m, compared to \u00a317.0m in the first half of the previous year, reflecting lower recurring revenues within the traditional private cloud and data centre services which also heavily impacts utilisation of our fixed cost infrastructure, alongside a shift in the Group's mix towards higher-growth, but lower-margin, Microsoft services. Cost efficiency improvements of \u00a34m on an annualised basis have been achieved, which will benefit the second half and beyond.\nTrading review by segment\nIomart Cloud Services\nRevenue for Iomart Cloud Services in the first half of the year was \u00a344.5m, compared to \u00a349.4m in the same period last year (as reclassified), representing a decrease of \u00a34.9m. This reduction reflects lower contributions from both managed services, which declined by 8%, and self-managed infrastructure, which fell by 24%. The largest element of this decline stems from the lower recurring revenue run-rate at the start of the year, following the higher customer churn experienced in the prior period. Non-recurring revenue remained stable at \u00a35.2m (H1 FY25: \u00a35.3m)\nSegmental EBITDA (before share-based payments, acquisition costs and central overheads) of \u00a39.1m represents a drop of \u00a36.0m from the first half of FY25 or \u00a33.3m from the second half of FY25. The trend in margin performance over the last several years has had many moving parts, including changes in revenue mix, timing of inflationary price adjustments and the well documented energy crisis. Revenue mix remains a feature in the period, with lower margin revenue associated with complex managed cloud services (including greater use of Azure public cloud) increasing, while higher margin self-managed infrastructure revenue decreases alongside lower utilisation of our fixed cost infrastructure. This mix shift towards public cloud creates proportionately lower capex requirements. The cost efficiencies already undertaken and our rolling efficiency programme is focussed on this area of the business.\nThe following is the disaggregation of Iomart Cloud Services revenues of \u00a344.5m (H1 2025 reclassified: \u00a349.5m). Iomart Cloud Services shares the data centre estate and fibre network infrastructure and associated support teams as an important part of the delivery of our recurring revenue services.\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n20241\n20251\nRevenue by operating segment\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCloud managed services\n33,043\n35,901\n71,869\nSelf-managed infrastructure\n6,230\n8,232\n15,241\nNon-recurring\n5,231\n5,312\n9,949\nTotal revenue\n44,504\n49,445\n97,059\n1\nsee note 12 for reclassification of historic periods.\nCloud managed services (recurring revenue)\nCloud managed services includes the provision of fully managed, complex, bespoke and resilient solutions involving private, public and hybrid cloud infrastructure.\nRevenues in this area reduced by 8% to \u00a333.0m (H1 2025 reclassified: \u00a335.9m). The underlying reduction from the prior period is a feature of a lower starting monthly recurring value as we started the financial year and also some delayed billing timing on the orders secured. Within this area, we have seen encouraging growth in Microsoft solutions, including Azure and Modern Work, which generated approximately \u00a33.8m revenue in the H1 period. These activities are expected to transition to Atech during H2, depending on specific customer arrangements.\nSelf-managed infrastructure (recurring revenue)\nSelf-managed infrastructure serves customers who prefer to source compute power and connectivity through dedicated servers, managing these directly. This segment represents a lower-growth area of the market and is most exposed to migration towards public cloud, given its transactional nature and reliance on customers' own technical capabilities. Revenue in the first half declined to \u00a36.2m, a reduction of \u00a32.0m compared to the prior year period, but only \u00a30.8m lower than H2 FY25, indicating a slowing rate of decline. Retention rates have improved within the long tail of the customer base, and the Rapidswitch brand continues to demonstrate resilience and stability, supported by our Maidenhead data centre. We have also realigned smaller legacy brands, including Sonassi, into our Domain and Mass Hosting segment to enhance customer experience and retention.\nNon-recurring revenue\nNon-recurring revenue has been stable at \u00a35.2m (H1 2025: \u00a35.3m) which relates primarily to hardware and software reselling plus professional services. These activities often serve as an entry point for new customers, creating opportunities to expand into higher-value recurring services.\nAtech\nAtech delivered revenue of \u00a325.6m for the six months ended 30 September 2025. As previously noted, we completed the transition of Extrinsica operations into Atech during the period, consolidating our Microsoft-focused solutions under a single business unit. Extrinsica contributed \u00a34.3m of revenue in the prior period and has maintained a stable profile since, supported by strong renewal levels as contracts are novated between legal entities.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming Atech had been part of the Group from 1 April 2024, revenue for the comparable six-month period last year would have been \u00a323.0m. The moderation in growth reflects a weaker contribution from non-recurring revenue and the timing of some larger order bookings, with initial billing expected to commence in the second half.\nAtech's EBITDA (before share-based payments, acquisition costs and central overheads) was \u00a32.6m, representing 10% of revenue, compared to \u00a33.2m (13%) in the second half of FY25 (as reclassified). The inclusion of Extrinsica, which was close to break-even on its \u00a34.3m revenue, has diluted margins but provides a strong platform for improvement as part of the enlarged Microsoft Centre of Excellence. During the period, we navigated a more challenging market pricing environment for M365 licensing. While we retained and grew revenue in this area, margins were lower overall. Nevertheless, our participation in this market is important, as it establishes customer relationships that enable us to upsell more value-added services. We have also invested in maturing Atech's product function to support scalable growth and expanded our Security Operations Centre (SOC), strengthening our capabilities in cyber security.\nThe table below shows Atech's revenue split between recurring and non-recurring activities:\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n20241\n20251\nRevenue by operating segment\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRecurring\n20,221\n4,081\n23,739\nNon-recurring\n5,344\n269\n6,449\nTotal revenue\n25,565\n4,350\n30,188\n1\nsee note 12 for reclassification of historic periods.\nAtech (recurring revenue)\nRecurring revenue within Atech continues to grow, reaching \u00a320.2m for the six-month period. While growth has been slower in recent months, this is primarily due to the timing of larger order bookings and associated billing schedules, which will benefit the second half.\nAtech (non-recurring revenue)\nAtech non-recurring revenue was \u00a35.3m, representing 21% of total Atech revenue. The largest component remains consultancy projects in cyber security, including a significant engagement with a long-standing financial services client, which contributed \u00a33.0m revenue during the period. This customer has provided repeat business over several years, and we expect the current scope of work to renew in the coming months. Hardware and software reselling activity from existing customers was subdued between May and July, contributing to the overall decline in non-recurring revenue compared to the prior period.\nDomain and Mass Hosting (Easyspace)\nThe Domain and Mass Hosting segment, which now incorporates the Sonassi brand alongside Easyspace and Hosting UK, recorded revenue of \u00a37.7m for the six months ended 30 September 2025, compared to \u00a38.2m in the prior period (as reclassified), representing a modest decline of 6%. This reduction was primarily driven by higher churn within the Sonassi brand, while the Easyspace and Hosting UK brands maintained more stable performance.\nSegment EBITDA (before share-based payments, acquisition costs and central overheads) was \u00a33.9m, equating to 51% of revenue, compared to \u00a34.5m (55% of revenue) in the prior period. The transfer of Sonassi and certain other customer cohorts into this segment introduces higher-margin activities.\nThe global domain name and mass-market hosting sector continues to expand, underpinned by the growing importance of online presence and e-commerce across all areas of the economy, including the small and micro-business community served by this division. While the market is dominated by a small number of large global operators, we remain committed to reinvigorating this segment. Our ambition is to reverse the historic trend of small, consistent revenue declines and return to modest growth, supported by strong renewal rates across all three brands. We recognise that Sonassi requires targeted investment to improve retention and enhance customer experience, and this work is already underway.\nGroup overheads\nGroup overheads, which are not allocated to segments, include the cost of the Board, certain professional fees, all the running costs of the headquarters in Glasgow, and Group led functions such as human resources, marketing, finance and design. Group overheads saw an increase of \u00a30.2m to \u00a32.6m (H1 2025: \u00a32.4m) with no material individual variances on the prior period.\nAdjusted EBIT\nFor the year ended 31 March\nFor the six months ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAdjusted EBITDA\n12,910\n16,952\n34,312\nDepreciation\n(7,109)\n(7,432)\n(14,730)\nAmortisation (non M&A)\n(3,657)\n(2,968)\n(6,757)\nAdjusted EBIT\n2,144\n6,552\n12,825\nThe Group depreciation charge of \u00a37.1m (H1 2025: \u00a37.4m) fell by \u00a30.3m in the period which as a percentage of recurring revenue is 10.5% (H1 2025: 13.1%). This is the fourth year in a row in which we have seen this percentage value drop and was accelerated in the current period given the very limited CAPEX needs of the Atech business.\nThe Group charge for amortisation of intangibles, excluding amortisation of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (\"amortisation of acquired intangible assets\"), of \u00a33.7m (H1 2025: \u00a33.0m) includes \u00a31.8m in relation to the Broadcom VMware software license arrangements which increased in the period following an extension of the licence pool.\nThe Group's adjusted EBIT decreased by \u00a34.4m to \u00a32.1m (H1 2025: \u00a36.6m) which in adjusted EBIT margin terms translates to 2.7% (H1 2025: 10.6%). We are focused on delivering an improvement in margin in H2 via our rolling cost efficiency programmes and growing higher margin value added services such as managed cyber security.\nAdjusted (loss)/ profit before tax\nFor the year ended 31 March\nFor the six months ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAdjusted EBIT\n2,144\n6,552\n12,825\nNet bank & other interest\n(3,734)\n(1,821)\n(5,442)\nAccelerated write off of arrangement fees on bank facility\n(319)\n-\n-\nFinance lease interest\n(594)\n(466)\n(928)\nAdjusted (loss)/profit before tax\n(2,503)\n4,265\n6,455\nFinance costs have increased by \u00a32.3m to \u00a34.3m (H1 2025: \u00a32.3m) reflecting the funding of the Atech acquisition on 1 October 2024. After deducting the charges for depreciation, amortisation (excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets) and finance costs from the adjusted EBITDA, the adjusted profit before tax for the period reduced by \u00a36.8m to \u00a32.5m loss (H1 2025: \u00a34.3m profit).\nStatutory IFRS (loss)/profit before tax\nThe measure of adjusted profit before tax is a non-statutory measure, which is commonly used to analyse the performance of companies where M&A activity forms a significant part of their activities.\nA reconciliation of adjusted profit before tax to Statutory IFRS profit after is shown below:\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n2024\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTotal adjusted (loss)/ profit before tax\n(2,503)\n4,265\n6,455\nAmortisation of acquired intangible assets\n(2,330)\n(1,613)\n(4,902)\nAcquisition costs\n-\n(1,151)\n(1,674)\nShare based payments\n(77)\n(514)\n(198)\nAdministrative expenses - exceptional non-recurring costs\n(1,561)\n-\n-\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n-\n(52,900)\nStatutory IFRS (loss)/profit before tax\n(6,471)\n987\n(53,219)\nThe larger adjusting items in the current period are:\n\u00b7\nnon-cash charges for the amortisation of acquired intangible assets of \u00a32.3m (H1 2025: \u00a31.6m), increasing by \u00a30.7m due to intangible assets established for customer relationships and brand on the acquisition of Atech on 1 October 2024; and\n\u00b7\nduring the period the Group incurred \u00a30.6m of exceptional administrative expenses relating to the change of Chief Executive Officer. Remaining exceptional costs related to the cost efficiency, integration and corporate programmes.\nAfter deducting the charges for share based payments, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition costs and exceptional non-recurring costs, the reported loss before tax is \u00a36.5m (H1 2025: \u00a31.0m profit).\nTaxation and profit for the period\nThere is a tax credit in the period of \u00a31.4m (H1 2025: \u00a30.6m charge), represented by a combination of a movement for deferred taxation in the period of \u00a30.8m (H1 2025: credit of \u00a30.1m) and a corporation tax credit on the loss in the period. There is no current tax charge in the period (H1 2024: \u00a30.7m). The adjusted effective tax rate, after adjusting for share based payments and acquisition costs, is 22% (H1 2025: 28%).\u00a0After deducting the tax credit/(charge) from the loss before tax, the Group has recorded a loss for the period from total operations of \u00a35.1m (H1 2025: \u00a30.4m profit).\nEarnings per share\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, which is based on (loss)/profit for the period attributed to ordinary shareholders before share based payment charges, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and acquisition costs. Non-recurring exceptional administrative expenses and the tax effect of these items, was 1.9p loss per share (H1 2025: 2.6p profit per share).\nThe measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share as described above is a non-statutory measure that is commonly used to analyse the performance of companies where M&A activity forms a significant part of their activities. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 4.5p loss per share (H1 2025: 0.3p profit per share). The calculation of both adjusted diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share is included at note 5.\nCash flow\nThe Group generated cash from operations (before exceptional costs) in the period of \u00a39.7m (H1 2025: \u00a311.6m) with an adjusted EBITDA conversion to cash ratio\n7\nin the period of 75% (H1 2025: 68%). The first half year typically has a lower conversion ratio. Cash payments for corporation tax in the period were \u00a30.3m (H1 2025: \u00a31.0m) and cash payments associated with exceptional items were \u00a31.4m (H1 2025: \u00a30.5m), resulting in positive net cash flow from operating activities in the period of \u00a38.0m (H1 2025: \u00a310.0m).\nExpenditure on investing activities of \u00a35.1m (H1 2025: \u00a38.5m) was incurred in the period. \u00a33.6m (H1 2025: \u00a34.0m) was incurred on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, principally to provide specific services to our customers, \u00a31.5m (H1 2025: \u00a31.2m) incurred in respect of development costs.\nDuring the first half of the year, net cash used in financing activities was \u00a310.9m (H1 2024: \u00a37.1m (excluding any Atech timing funding only related items)). All shares issued in the current period under share options were issued at nominal value. In the current period we repaid \u00a32.0m of lease liabilities (H1 2025: \u00a32.2m) and paid \u00a33.4m (H1 2025: \u00a31.5m) of finance charges. A total of \u00a35.2m (H1 2025: \u00a32.6m) was paid in relation to software license arrangements, principally annual instalments on the Broadcom VMware partnership commitments during the period. In the current period, M&A related payments were limited to \u00a30.4m final contingent consideration payments on the Accesspoint acquisitions (H1 2025: \u00a30.7m between the Extrinsica and Accesspoint acquisitions). No dividend payment was made in the period (H1 2025: \u00a33.4m). A \u00a30.5m drawdown was made in the period from the revolving credit facility of which \u00a30.4m was used to fund fees associated with the June 25 bank refinancing. As a result, cash and cash equivalent balances at the end of the period was \u00a35.1m (30 September 2024: \u00a310.2m (excluding any Atech timing funding only related items)).\nNet Debt\nThe analysis of the net debt is shown below:\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n2024\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nBank revolver loan\n97,500\n97,000\n97,000\nLess: cash and cash equivalents\n(5,088)\n(67,212)\n(13,088)\nBank revolver loan less cash and cash equivalents\n92,412\n29,788\n83,912\nLease liabilities\n17,233\n18,282\n18,006\nNet Debt\n109,645\n48,070\n101,918\nAt 30 September 2024 we had the unusual situation of holding \u00a367.2m of cash and cash equivalents which included the \u00a357m of drawn funds for the Atech acquisition which completed on the following day. Excluding this transaction, cash and cash equivalents were \u00a310.2m, reflecting normal operating liquidity parameters.\nIn June 2025, we secured a new \u00a3115m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) from a syndicate comprising The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, HSBC UK Bank plc, and Clydesdale Bank plc (trading as Virgin Money). This facility, which extends to 30 June 2027, provides long-term funding certainty and includes covenants limited to debt cover and interest cover, aligned with the Group's current leverage position and strategic objectives. At current leverage levels, the bank margin under the new RCF is 3.0% above SONIA, with a margin ratchet mechanism that reduces interest costs as the Group deleverages.\nFollowing the Atech acquisition, the net debt position represents 3.65x our adjusted last 12 months EBITDA, or 3.1x excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities of \u00a317.2m. While this is a higher leverage level than historically, it reflects a deliberate investment in strategic growth and fundamentally repositioning the Group. Importantly, we have a clear and actionable plan to reduce leverage:\n\u00b7\nPositive H2 cash generation expected, supported by improved trading, absence of annual Broadcom payments which are paid in the first month of each financial year, and lower exceptional items.\n\u00b7\nCost optimisation programme, already delivering annualised savings of \u00a34m.\n\u00b7\nContinued focus on operational efficiency and exploring opportunities to generate surplus cash as we refine strategic plans and business models.\nThe Board and management team remain fully committed to deleveraging the business and maintaining a robust financial position.

Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2025 comprise the consolidated financial statements of impart Group plc ('the Company') and its subsidiaries (collectively 'the Group').\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the Group's annual consolidated financial statements and do not constitute statutory financial statements as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. These accounts included an independent auditor's report, which was unqualified and did not contain any statement under section 493 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe accounting policies and estimation techniques applied in the condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025. The provisions of IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' have not been applied in full.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in thousands of pounds sterling, which is the Group's presentation currency.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have assessed the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on its ability to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of these condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAt the period end, the Group had access to a \u00a3115 million revolving credit facility maturing on 30 June 2027, providing funding certainty and liquidity headroom, with all covenants met comfortably. Net debt at the period end was \u00a3109.6 million (H1 2025: \u00a348.1 million). Whilst leverage is temporarily elevated, the Board has a clear plan to reduce through cost efficiencies and cash generation.\nThe Group's financial performance since year-end has remained broadly in line with the Board-approved FY26 budget and the base case used for the bank refinancing which was successfully concluded on 27 June 2025. Stress testing performed at year-end demonstrated adequate covenant headroom, and actual trading since then has not altered this conclusion.\n2. Operating segments\nThe Group's operating segments are defined and presented in accordance with IFRS 8: Operating Segments, based on the internal management reporting structure and financial information reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The Group's primary reporting format is by business unit.\nDuring the period, the Group revised its operating segments to align with the updated business unit structure. Comparative information has been restated accordingly. The prior period reclassifications are detailed in note 12.\nThe Group's revised operating segments are:\nIomart Cloud Services\nProvider of managed cloud hosting, colocation, and connectivity services through owned UK data centres. Delivers private and hybrid cloud solutions, backup and disaster recovery, and managed IT services primarily to the larger SME and corporate market.\nAtech\nLeading and rapidly growing Microsoft Solution Partner, delivering complex, public cloud deployments, modern workplace solutions, digital transformation and specialised managed services to mid-sized enterprises.\nDomain and Mass Hosting (Easyspace)\nOur domain and mass hosting division delivering domain name registration and mass hosting services primarily to small and micro businesses.\nRevenue by operating segment\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n2024*\n2025*\nRevenue by operating segment\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nIomart Cloud Services\n44,504\n49,445\n97,059\nAtech\n25,565\n4,350\n30,188\nDomain and Mass Hosting (Easyspace)\n7,676\n8,155\n16,213\nTotal revenue\n77,745\n61,950\n143,460\n1Reclassification of historic periods is detailed in note 12.\nIomart revenue can be further disaggregated as follows:\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n20241\n20251\nIomart disaggregated revenue\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCloud managed services\n33,043\n35,901\n71,869\nSelf-managed infrastructure\n6,230\n8,232\n15,241\nNon-recurring\n5,231\n5,312\n9,949\nTotal revenue\n44,504\n49,445\n97,059\n1Reclassification of historic periods is detailed in note 12.\nRecurring and Non-Recurring Revenue\nThe amount of recurring and non-recurring revenue recognised during the year can be summarised as follows:\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n2024*\n2025*\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRecurring\n67,189\n56,638\n126,272\nNon-recurring\n10,556\n5,312\n17,188\nTotal revenue\n77,745\n61,950\n143,460\n1see note 12 for reclassification of historic periods.\nGeographical Information\nIn presenting the consolidated information on a geographical basis, revenue is based on the geographical location of customers. The United Kingdom is the place of domicile of the parent company, iomart Group plc. No individual country other than the United Kingdom contributes a material amount of revenue; therefore revenue from outside the United Kingdom has been shown as from Rest of the World.\nFor the six months ended 30 September\nFor the year ended 31 March\n2025\n2024\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nUnited Kingdom\n71,662\n54,765\n126,272\nRest of world\n6,083\n7,185\n17,188\n77,745\n61,950\n143,460\nProfit by operating segment\nFor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n\u00a3'000\nIomart\nAtech\nEasyspace\nCorporate centre\nTotal\nAdjusted EBITDA\n9,091\n2,581\n3,886\n(2,648)\n12,910\nDepreciation\n(6,901)\n(146)\n(62)\n-\n(7,109)\nAmortisation other intangibles\n(3,182)\n(146)\n(172)\n(157)\n(3,657)\nTotal adjusted EBIT\n(992)\n2,289\n3,652\n(2,805)\n2,144\nFinance costs\n(4,647)\n(4,647)\nShare based payments\n(77)\n(77)\nExceptionals\n(1,561)\n(1,561)\nAmortisation acquired intangibles\n(2,330)\n(2,330)\nStatutory IFRS profit/(loss) before tax\n(6,471)\nFor the six months ended 30 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\nIomart\nAtech\nEasyspace\nCorporate centre\nTotal\nAdjusted EBITDA\n15,054\n(173)\n4,514\n(2,442)\n16,952\nDepreciation\n(7,385)\n(9)\n(39)\n-\n(7,432)\nAmortisation other intangibles\n(2,561)\n(138)\n(175)\n(95)\n(2,968)\nTotal adjusted EBIT\n5,108\n(320)\n4,300\n(2,537)\n6,552\nFinance costs\n(2,287)\n(2,287)\nShare based payments\n(514)\n(514)\nAcquisition costs\n(1,151)\n(1,151)\nAmortisation Acquired intangibles\n(1,613)\n(1,613)\nStatutory IFRS profit/(loss) before tax\n987\nFor the year ended 31 March 2025\n\u00a3'000\nIomart\nAtech\nEasyspace\nCorporate centre\nTotal\nAdjusted EBITDA\n27,460\n3,067\n8,562\n(4,777)\n34,312\nDepreciation\n(14,522)\n(132)\n(76)\n(14,730)\nAmortisation other intangibles\n(5,945)\n(288)\n(350)\n(174)\n(6,757)\nTotal adjusted EBIT\n6,993\n2,647\n8,136\n(4,951)\n12,825\nFinance costs\n(6,370)\n(6,370)\nShare based payments\n(198)\n(198)\nAcquisition costs\n(1,674)\n(1,674)\nExceptionals\n(52,900)\n(52,900)\nAmortisation acquired intangibles\n(4,902)\n(4,902)\nIFRS profit/(loss) before tax\n(53,219)\n3.

Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, after deducting shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the total of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after adjusting for the dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to share options.
