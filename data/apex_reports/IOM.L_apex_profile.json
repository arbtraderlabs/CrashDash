For the first half of the year we have experienced flat revenue performance of \u00a362.0m (H1 2024: \u00a362.0m), of which 91% was recurring revenue (H1 2024: 94%). Adjusted EBITDA\n2\nand adjusted profit before tax\n4\ndecreased to \u00a317.0m (H1 2024: \u00a318.6m) and \u00a34.3m (H1 FY24: \u00a37.6m), respectively. The acquisition of Atech, being after the period end, has no impact on the financial reporting in the first half of the year.\nAs previously announced, while the financial performance this year was always expected to be H2 weighted, these results are behind our original plans, due to lower renewal rates and the timing of order billings.\nWe are actively addressing these areas and implementing targeted initiatives to support stronger retention. The acquisition of Atech will strengthen our ability to retain customers and accelerate customer acquisitions to close in on this gap.\nThe programme of work to streamline our operating model, drive best practice and improve the differentiation of our product and service offerings is progressing well. We continue to build further\nmomentum in order bookings and pipeline generation, with order bookings in the first half at record levels.\nWe have\nmobilised a cost optimisation programme, targeting over \u00a31m of annualised gross cost benefits by end of FY25. Further synergies and efficiencies continue to be identified.\nWe are confident these actions and progress achieved, alongside the transformational acquisition of Atech post period end, set us firmly on the path to growth.\nAcquisition of Atech\nThe completion of the \u00a357m acquisition of Kookaburra Topco Limited (\"Kookaburra\"), the holding company of Atech Support Limited (\"Atech\" or the \"Acquisition\") is a significant milestone for iomart in our 'Bigger, Better, Bolder' strategy. This accelerates and plays directly into our vision to be the UK's leading secure public, private and hybrid cloud services provider.\nAtech is one of the UK's most highly accredited Microsoft Solutions Partners and the combination of the two businesses creates a powerful extended set of offerings for mid-market customers, cementing the Group's position as a leading 'Microsoft First' solutions provider in the UK. This means our revenue portfolio is now more heavily weighted to the highest growth areas of the cloud computing market: modern workplace, public cloud Azure infrastructure and security managed services.\nAtech has one of the strongest sets of Microsoft credentials in the UK market, including Azure Expert MSP, five Solution Partner Designations (Azure Infrastructure, Security, Data & AI, Modern Work and Digital and Application Innovation), plus eleven Specialisations, membership of Microsoft's exclusive Intelligent Security Association ('MISA') and participation in Microsoft's Copilot jump-start programme. Earlier this year, Atech was recognised as a finalist at Microsoft's Security Trailblazer's Awards.\nAt the time of announcing the acquisition, we reported last 12 months unaudited trading results to 30 June 2024 for Atech of revenues of \u00a332.2m and Proforma Adjusted EBITDA\n8\nof \u00a33.3m. We are pleased to report that in the 3 months prior to acquisition, Atech continued to grow, resulting in an LTM to 30 September 2024 of \u00a334.4m (unaudited), of which 73% is recurring in nature, and Proforma Adjusted EBITDA\n8\nof \u00a34.1m (unaudited), demonstrating continued and consistent demand for their services and reinforcing our confidence in the value of the business.\nMobilising This Powerful Combination\nCloud managed services within iomart has been our focus for development and M&A activity over the last four years, and prior to the Atech acquisition, accounted for 68% of Group revenue, combined recurring and non-recurring. Following the Atech acquisition, on a proforma basis, the equivalent weighting is increased to 75%. Importantly the enlarged offering is now more appropriately balanced, increasing from approximately 17% to 30% of activities of that segment now within the Microsoft product suite, the highest growth area of the market. Non-recurring revenue on a proforma basis has increased to 14% of total revenue, reflecting the higher level of professional services undertaken by Atech, especially within the growth area of security.\nWe have mobilised a 100 day plan to combine our businesses, to leverage the 'best of both' in terms of capabilities and processes. As previously announced, the absence of an earn-out mechanism means there are no hinderances to the immediate integration of the organisations, ensuring we start to secure the full benefits of the combination from an early stage.\nOur initial priorities have been to combine our brand and market positioning and bring our technical and sales teams together. The launch branding has been positioned as \"Atech x iomart, a powerful combination\" with a focus on articulating our significantly enhanced capabilities across the full spectrum of cloud services to both existing and potential customers. We are consolidating the Atech, iomart and Extrinsica technical teams into a single centre of excellence with deep Microsoft Azure expertise, combining the strengths of all our highly accredited people with numerous certifications and specialisations including the coveted Microsoft Azure Expert MSP accreditation acquired in September 2024. And finally, we are combining our sales teams, sales specialists, pre-sales and technical architect resources to widen and deepen customer coverage and sector expertise.\nDelivering on Bigger, Better, Bolder\nThe Atech acquisition is a key step in delivering our Bigger, Better, Bolder strategy and moves us considerably closer to our goal of becoming the UK's leading secure cloud services provider.\nThe Bigger, Better, Bolder mantra has also landed positively with our teams internally. The wider iomart team has embraced the ambitious agenda we have set and we have made excellent progress so far in FY25 in driving best practices across the business and strengthening capabilities to establish the best possible ingredients for success in every part of the business.\nNotable H1 highlights have been:\nImproving Sales Effectiveness\nOur sales organisation is well established and good progress has continued in the first half in optimising and strengthening resources, account coverage, sales specialists and channel/partner coverage, resulting in continued order booking growth which is now at record levels. During the period all functions and activity from historic acquisitions of Cristie Data, Pavilion IT and Oriium has been fully embedded into the group operating model, as one combined team, with systems and tools integration progressing well.\nMarket Leading Partnerships\nWe have now established, and are developing, three significant strategic partnerships for the Group: Microsoft (public cloud/modern workplace/security), Broadcom VMware (private cloud) and Commvault (data protection). These Partners are recognised as global technology leaders in clearly defined areas of our product and service offerings. We now have exceptional pedigree, engineering skills and credentials across their associated technologies and capabilities with\njoint go-to-market and innovation/R&D programmes being developed.\nITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) Aligned Delivery Excellence\nWith the over-riding objectives of streamlining our operating model, significant progress has been made in implementing\nITIL-aligned, best practice customer success methodologies and an enhanced resource and training strategy, including iomart's first ever apprenticeship programme for 1st Line Service. This approach has delivered a step change improvement in our service delivery and customer management, consolidated teams from 14 different locations, delivered efficiency\nsavings that we have reinvested into a larger service management team, and led to us adding dedicated Technical Account Management for some key accounts.\nH2 focus\nLooking ahead, our key areas of focus underpinning the 'Bigger, Better, Bolder' strategy will be:\n\u00b7\nBrand and market positioning of Atech x iomart and sales enablement to capitalise fully on the revenue growth opportunities of the combination, including cross selling opportunities to our significant existing customer bases\n\u00b7\nContinued push to a streamlined operating model to drive efficiencies and best practise\n\u00b7\nIdentify and progress cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities resulting from the acquisition of Atech to drive the most competitive cost base for the business and establish compelling customer propositions into high growth market segments such as security/cyber\nWe operate in a structurally growing market\nWith the insatiable growth in data requirements and processing power across all industries, the demand for the three core cloud building blocks of compute power, storage and connectivity continue to expand. The concept of Cloud computing is now globally recognised with the complexity of available options continuing to grow. For any digital transforming organisation, and with the ever-increasing cyber security threat landscape, the need for full-stack integrated services across cloud management, data protection and cyber security is paramount. With resource and skills scarcity, SMEs are increasingly having to outsource these requirements to experts, who can help them navigate a constantly evolving and complex technical landscape, providing high levels of reliability, customer support, flexibility, and technical knowledge - areas in which we excel.\nWe do not expect any of the above structural growth drivers to diminish over the long-term and indeed AI is anticipated to fuel another wave of growth, both in public and private cloud. While public cloud adoption continues to accelerate this is balanced with a growing trend of repatriation of critical workloads back to private cloud, driven by increased regulatory focus on business resilience and data sovereignty governance. iomart is well positioned to meet these hybrid cloud needs.\nBoard Changes\nRichard Last joined the Company on 12 June 2024 as independent non-executive Chair. Richard is a seasoned board director with extensive experience across quoted and private companies in the technology services sector. He brings a wealth of experience in various roles in\u00a0successful communications and technology companies and is a great asset as we drive forward the execution of our growth strategy.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nWith robust order bookings, enhanced customer service, a significantly improved product portfolio, and the first stages of cost efficiency measures activated, we are well positioned for a stronger second half but it remains a challenging environment for customer retention in our core business.\nAtech integration is progressing to plan, and growth has continued, reinforcing our confidence in the value of the business and its value to the enlarged Group\n.\nThe underlying drivers for cloud computing are strong. T\nhe increasing complexity of the technical landscape means the demand from customers looking for a trusted and experienced service partner will continue to expand, especially within our SME target market. Through the combined power of Atech and iomart, we now have the accreditations, credentials and capabilities to convert a greater proportion of these opportunities in our sales pipeline and improve customer retention levels.\nThe growing demand for cloud computing and cyber security solutions, increasing complexity of the technical landscape, and need for a trusted and highly accredited partner with a strong delivery track record, give the Board confidence in the outlook for the medium-term prospects for the Group.\nLucy Dimes\nChief Executive Officer\n27 November 2024\nChief Financial Officer's Review\nAs anticipated and previously flagged, H1 figures were impacted by the new Broadcom license arrangement which resulted in a short-term negative impact of \u00a30.7m on Adjusted EBIT (being \u00a31.4m new intangible amortisation charge, net of the \u00a30.7m previous opex cost), and reduced levels of recurring revenue, reflecting H2 prior year trading. Trading results were further impacted by the timing of some order billings and the continuation of lower customer renewals which has negated the positive contribution from recent acquisitions and an uplift in orders. Given iomart's relatively fixed cost base in some areas, including depreciation, amortisation, and interest expense, this has had a notable impact on H1 profitability.\nAction has been taken to address some of the profitability trends, including cost efficiency and integration programmes which will benefit H2 and onwards.\nThese programmes will now be assessed within the context of the enlarged Group following the transformational Atech acquisition, with the strengthened product portfolio enhancing customer acquisition and retention, enabling economies of scale and access to an established captive offshore operation in India.\nFinancial impact of Atech acquisition\nThe acquisition of Atech has four clear financial benefits to the Group. Firstly, the proportion of Group revenues derived from the growth areas of cloud managed services has considerably increased. Secondly, it is anticipated that renewal levels within our existing customer base will stabilise, as there is now a clear pathway to remain with iomart while adopting elements of the public cloud. Thirdly, we have gained access to a high quality offshore operation, and finally, capex requirements as a proportion of revenue has decreased, providing greater scalability within the Group.\nIn her CEO Statement, Lucy has described the increased strategic strength of the combined business, bringing the potential to stabilise our existing business, and for both organisations to grow faster, together.\nWith continued high levels of recurring revenues, strong cash generation, healthy profit margins and a suite of in demand cloud offerings, the future for iomart Group now looks considerably improved.\nOperational Review by Segment\nCloud Services\nCloud Services revenues increased marginally to\n\u00a356.0m (H1 2024: \u00a355.8m\n). This included \u00a33.7m of additional revenue from the positive impact of our M&A activities in the prior year; split \u00a32.8m recurring revenue and \u00a30.9m non-recurring revenue. Cloud Services EBITDA (before share-based payments, acquisition costs, exceptional non-recurring costs and central group overheads) was \u00a316.3m being 29.2% of cloud services revenue (H1 2024: \u00a318.2m, 32.6% of cloud services revenue).\nThe trend in margin performance over the last three years has had many moving parts, including changes in revenue mix, timing of inflationary price adjustments and during FY22 and FY23 the well documented energy crisis. In the current period, revenue mix remains a feature, with lower margin revenue associated with complex managed cloud services increasing while higher margin self-managed infrastructure revenue decreases. This mix shift towards cloud does come with proportionately lower capex requirements.\nThe following is the disaggregation of Cloud Services revenues of \u00a356.0m (H1 2024: \u00a355.8m). Cloud Services shares the data centre estate and fibre network\ninfrastructure and associated support teams as an important part of the delivery of our recurring revenue services.\nDisaggregation of Cloud Services revenue\n6 months to 30 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30 September 2023\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31\nMarch\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCloud managed services\n38,253\n37,022\n75,212\nSelf-managed infrastructure\n12,394\n14,730\n28,429\nNon-recurring revenue\n5,312\n4,026\n10,937\n55,959\n55,778\n114,578\nCloud managed services (recurring revenue)\nCloud managed services includes the provision of fully managed, complex, bespoke and resilient solutions involving private, public and hybrid cloud infrastructure. We anticipate this will be the highest growth area for iomart due to the market drivers described above and while this increasing proportion of revenue from cloud managed services will reduce the overall group margin it brings us higher growth and gives us a much bigger total addressable market to serve.\nCloud managed services revenue increased by 3% to \u00a338.3m (H1 2024: \u00a337.0m). This was a combination of 4% underlying organic reduction and approximately \u00a32.8m contribution from the two FY24 acquisitions. The underlying reduction from the prior year is a feature of\nsome specific timing of order billings, with the balance from a lower starting monthly recurring value, reflecting H2 prior year trading plus a lower renewal level in the current period.\nSelf-managed infrastructure (recurring revenue)\nWe have a large customer base, who wish to source compute power and connectivity mainly through the provision of dedicated servers and self-manage these directly. This area of the cloud market is lower growth and the most susceptible to a move to public cloud infrastructure as the customers have retained their own technical IT skills and an infrastructure only service is more transactional.\nIn the first half of this financial year, the self-managed infrastructure revenue of \u00a312.4m represented a reduction of \u00a32.3m in comparison to the first half of last year or a \u00a31.3m reduction on H2. We continue to secure new orders in this area but revenue reduction from the long tail of the customer base, has continued without any improvement from the prior period. The largest impact of this is within the customer base of the smaller historic acquisitions in this area, with the larger Rapidswitch customer base proving to be more resilient. During this year we are seeking to migrate the remaining customers from the smaller brands to more core group platforms. This will provide customers with a more resilient and enhanced customer service experience, at the same time as improving our own operational efficiency.\nNon-recurring revenue\nNon-recurring revenue of \u00a35.3m (H1 2024: \u00a34.0m) relates primarily to hardware and software reselling plus professional services. Often these non-recurring activities provide a useful initial introduction to the wider iomart Group and evolve customers into a higher level of recurring services. The revenue increase in the period is a combination of around \u00a30.9m from acquisition, with the balance being 10% organic growth.\nDuring the period we have completed the final steps of the full integration of two historic acquisitions which had undertaken a higher proportion of non-recurring activities being Cristie Data and Pavilion IT. The brands have been retired and customers and delivery operations transferred to the core iomart operating model.\nEasyspace\nThe Easyspace segment has performed well during the period, delivering reasonably stable revenues and EBITDA (before share based payments, acquisition costs and central Group overheads) of \u00a36.0m (H1 2024: \u00a36.3m) and \u00a33.0m (H1 2024: \u00a33.2m), respectively. This stability and predictability have been a feature of this business unit over the last few years.\nThe global domain name and mass market hosting sector continues to grow, supported by the increasing importance of an internet presence and ecommerce for all areas of the economy, including the small and micro business community represented within our Easyspace division. A smaller number of large global operators increasingly dominates this sector, and we recognised a long time ago that the marketing expenditure required to compete for new business in this specific area was not the best use of iomart's resources. However, we do ensure our customer base are well-served with a good range of products and importantly a high level of customer service. This level of attention is ensuring strong renewal rates by customers.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue\nOverall revenue from our operations remained flat at \u00a362.0m (H1 2024: \u00a362.0m) with a high level of recurring revenue at 91% (H1 2024: 94%).\nWe remain focused on retaining our recurring revenue business model with the combination of multi-year contracts and payments in advance providing us with good revenue visibility. While the Atech acquisition will reduce the percentage somewhat going forward due to a higher proportion of consultancy activity as they support customers in their digital migrations and security positioning, the enlarged group's recurring revenue is anticipated to remain at over 85% of Group revenue. In the last 12 months to 30 September 2024, Atech reported 73% of revenues as recurring in nature.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit in the period reduced to \u00a333.4m (H1 2024: \u00a334.5m) with the gross profit as a percentage of revenue of 53.9%, as expected being a reduction from prior period (H1 2024: 55.6% of revenue). Our key vendor relationships have remained stable in the period with any cost increases following more general inflationary trends. Our energy hedging strategy, which we entered into around the end of the calendar year 2022, means have seen stability in the period although at levels above current spot market rates. New hedging arrangements will commence from April 2025 onwards. The specific revenue mix is dilutive on gross margin, with specifically H1 this year being impacted by the full period impact of the 5 June 2023 Extrinsica acquisition, overall higher content of Microsoft licence consumption in our customer solutions and also higher non-recurring reselling activity. As outlined below, offsetting some of these factors is the change in classification on software expenses following the new commercial arrangements with Broadcom VMware which is favourable to gross margin.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Group's adjusted EBITDA reduced by 9% to \u00a317.0m (H1 2024: \u00a318.6m) which in EBITDA margin terms translates to 27.4% (H1 2024: 30%). The lower margin percentage is a function of the gross margin profile, the high fixed cost base nature of our private cloud business activity and the administration expenses (before depreciation, amortisation, share based payment charges, acquisition costs and exceptional non-recurring costs) of \u00a316.5m being \u00a30.6m higher than the previous period due to the inclusion of staff plus overhead costs from the Extrinsica and Accesspoint acquisitions, partially mitigated by some reductions in the core overhead base. Outside of the acquisitions, we have seen a period of relatively stable overall headcount numbers and other overhead costs.\nA further unique feature to the current period is the change in income statement classification on software expenses following the new commercial arrangements with Broadcom VMware plus the overall higher cost imposed. Due to the long-term commitments made, these software costs are capitalised and reported as intangible asset amortisation, replacing the previous license consumption cost of sales classification. In the first half of the year the amortisation charge for this matter has increased by \u00a31.4m, replacing a consumption based cost of sales value of around \u00a30.7m.\nCloud Services saw a 10% decrease in its adjusted EBITDA to \u00a316.3m (H1 2024: \u00a318.2m), giving a margin of 29.2% (H1 2024: 32.6%). Adjusted EBITDA for Easyspace was consistent at \u00a33.1m (H1 2024: \u00a33.2m) and EBITDA margin at 51.0% (H1 2024: 50.6%).\nGroup overheads, which are not allocated to segments, include the cost of the Board, all the running costs of the headquarters in Glasgow, and Group led functions such as human resources, marketing, finance and design. Group overheads saw a reduction of \u00a30.3m to \u00a32.4m (H1 2024: \u00a32.7m) with no material individual variances on prior period.\nAdjusted EBIT\nThe Group depreciation charge of \u00a37.4m (H1 2024: \u00a37.7m) fell by \u00a30.3m in the period which as a percentage of recurring revenue is 13.1% (H1 2024: 13.3%). This is the third year in a row in which we have seen this percentage value drop. The Group charge for amortisation of intangibles, excluding amortisation of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (\"amortisation of acquired intangible assets\"), of \u00a33.0m (H1 2024: \u00a31.3m) is higher primarily due to Broadcom VMware software license arrangements. The Group's adjusted EBIT decreased by \u00a33.0m to \u00a36.6m (H1 2024: \u00a39.6m) which in adjusted EBIT margin terms translates to 10.6% (H1 2024: 15.5%). The actions taken to address some of the profitability trends experienced, including cost efficiency and integration programmes are very much focussed on seeing recovery of this metric in H2.\nAdjusted profit before tax\nNet finance costs have increased to \u00a32.3m (H1 2024: \u00a32.0m) reflecting the increase in our borrowing cost from the rise in bank rates. After deducting the charges for depreciation, amortisation, excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, and finance costs from the adjusted EBITDA, the adjusted profit before tax for the period decreased by \u00a33.3m to \u00a34.3m (H1 2024: \u00a37.6m) representing an adjusted profit before tax margin of 6.9% (H1 2024: 12.2%).\nProfit before tax\nThe measure of adjusted profit before tax is a non-statutory measure, which is commonly used to analyse the performance of companies where M&A activity forms a significant part of their activities.\nA reconciliation of adjusted profit before tax to reported profit before tax is shown below:\nReconciliation of adjusted profit before tax to profit before tax\n6 months to 30 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30 September 2023\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31\nMarch\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nAdjusted profit before tax\n4,265\n7,581\n14,956\nLess: Share based payments\n(514)\n(206)\n(517)\nLess: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets\n(1,613)\n(1,982)\n(4,226)\nLess: Acquisition costs\n(1,151)\n(538)\n(1,010)\nLess: Administrative costs - exceptional non-recurring costs\n-\n(462)\n(462)\nProfit before tax\n987\n4,393\n8,741\nThe larger adjusting items in the current period are:\n\u00b7\nnon-cash charges for the amortisation of acquired intangible assets of \u00a31.6m (H1 2024: \u00a32.0m), decreasing by \u00a30.4m due to the timing of the historic acquisitions and profile of the amortisation of intangible assets established for customer relationships; and\n\u00b7\nacquisition costs of \u00a31.2m (H1 2024: \u00a30.5m) including accruals for professional fees on the Atech acquisition of \u00a30.6m paid following completion on the 1 October 2024.\nAfter deducting the charges for share based payments, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition costs and exceptional non-recurring costs, the reported profit before tax is \u00a31.0m (H1 2024: \u00a34.4m).\nTaxation and profit for the period\nThere is a tax charge in the period of \u00a30.6m (H1 2024: \u00a31.0m), which comprises a current taxation charge of \u00a30.7m (H1 2024: \u00a31.1m), and a deferred taxation credit of \u00a30.1m (H1 2024: credit of \u00a30.1m). The adjusted effective tax rate, after adjusting for share based payments and acquisition costs, is 28% (H1 2024: 23%).\u00a0After deducting the tax charge from the profit before tax, the Group has recorded a profit for the period from total operations of \u00a30.4m (H1 2024: \u00a33.4m).\nEarnings per share\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, which is based on profit for the period attributed to ordinary shareholders before share based payment charges, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition costs and the tax effect of these items, was 2.6p (H1 2024: 5.2p).\nThe measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share as described above is a non-statutory measure that is commonly used to analyse the performance of companies where M&A activity forms a significant part of their activities. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.3p (H1 2024: 3.1p). The calculation of both adjusted diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share is included at note 3.\nCash flow\nThe Group generated cash from operations (before cash flow on exceptional acquisition costs) in the period of \u00a311.6m (H1 2024: \u00a316.8m) with an adjusted EBITDA conversion to cash ratio\n7\nin the period of 68% (H1 2024: 90%). The first half year typically has a lower conversion ratio. In the current period this has been exaggerated due the exact timing of payments to six larger vendors which overlapped the opening and closing period ends with an impact of around \u00a32.5m being 15% of H1 EBITDA. To emphasise some of this timing aspect, the equivalent EBITDA conversion ratio on a last 12 month basis was 87%. Cash payments for corporation tax in the period were \u00a31.0m (H1 2024: \u00a30.8m), resulting in net cash flow from operating activities in the period of \u00a310.0m (H1 2024: \u00a316.0m).\nExpenditure on investing activities of \u00a38.5m (H1 2024: \u00a312.8m) was incurred in the period. \u00a34.0m (H1 2024: \u00a35.3m) was incurred on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, principally to provide specific services to our customers (prior period included \u00a31.4m to upgrade fibre network equipment), \u00a31.2m (H1 2024: \u00a30.9m) incurred in respect of development costs and \u00a32.6m (H1 2024: \u00a31.4m) paid in relation to software license arrangements during the period. The increase in software licenses paid being the first year instalment on the Broadcom VMware five year partnership commitments. In the current period, M&A related payments were limited to \u00a30.7m being the smaller contingent consideration payments on the Extrinsica and Accesspoint acquisitions. The only remaining contingent consideration at 30 September 2024 was a \u00a31.4m of earn-out payment due on the Accesspoint acquisition which was paid in full, subsequent to the period end.\nDuring the first half of the year, excluding any Atech timing funding only related items, net cash used in financing activities was \u00a37.1m (H1 2024: \u00a36.4m). All shares issued in the current period under share options were issued at nominal value. In the current period we repaid \u00a32.2m of lease liabilities (H1 2024: \u00a32.8m), paid \u00a31.5m (H1 2024: \u00a31.4m) of finance charges and made a dividend payment of \u00a33.4m (H1 2024: \u00a33.9m). In the prior period we made a \u00a35.5m drawdown on the revolving credit facility solely to support the acquisition related payments in that period and we repaid \u00a33.7m of bank debt acquired from Extrinsica on completion. As a result, cash and cash equivalent balances at the end of the period, excluding any Atech timing funding only related items, were at a similar level to prior period at \u00a310.2m (30 September 2023: \u00a310.7m).\nOn the day prior to completion of the Atech acquisition (30 September 2024) we drew down \u00a357m from the revolving credit facility, with the cash being held by our lawyer for the closure of the Atech acquisition on the 1 October 2024. This one transaction was recorded within the 30 September 2024 balance sheet with all other Atech acquisition matters, including completion, being a subsequent event. This situation resulted in our cash balance on 30 September 2024 being \u00a367.2m in the reported balance sheet.\nSubsequent Event - Acquisition of Atech on 1 October 2024\nThe purchase price for the acquisition of Atech was \u00a357m, on a cash free, normalised working capital and debt free basis under a locked box completion mechanism. The purchase price included \u00a319.6m of debt repayments and working capital adjustments at completion, with the balance paid to the previous shareholders. The full purchase price was financed through a combination of existing bank facilities and cash on the Company's balance sheet. There is no deferred or contingent consideration.\nNet Debt\nThe analysis of the net debt is shown below:\n30 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\n30 September 2023\n\u00a3'000\n31 March\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nBank revolver loan\n97,000\n39,900\n40,000\nLease liabilities\n18,282\n18,756\n18,091\nLess: cash and cash equivalents\n(67,212)\n(10,673)\n(15,755)\nNet Debt\n48,070\n47,983\n42,336\nAs noted earlier on 30 September 2024 we had the unusual situation of holding \u00a367.2m of cash and cash equivalents which included the \u00a357m of drawn funds for the Atech acquisition. Excluding this transaction, cash and cash equivalents were \u00a310.2m and bank revolver loan would have been \u00a340m, being the same value as at 31 March 2024. This transaction does not change the closing net debt position of \u00a348.1m, which represented a 1.3 times multiple of the last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA to net debt.\nFollowing the 1 October 2024 acquisition of Atech, the Group's net debt position increased to \u00a3105.1m. This is around 2.6 times annualised enlarged Group proforma Adjusted EBITDA, well within our bank facility terms and a comfortable level, given the Group's recurring revenue business model and strong cash generation.\nExcluding leases under IFRS 16, net debt following the Atech acquisition would be \u00a386.8m.\nAt the end of September 2024 we increased our Revolving Credit Bank Facility, provided by a four-bank group consisting of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Ireland and Clydesdale Bank, from \u00a3100m to \u00a3125m to provide additional undrawn sums for the Group. This facility expires on 30 June 2026 and now has a borrowing cost at the Group's current leverage levels of 250 basis points over SONIA.\nDividend\nWe have a dividend policy where the maximum pay-out is 50% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. Given the high recurring revenue nature of the Group, good visibility on cash flow requirements and comfortable level of indebtedness within the Group, we have applied the maximum pay-out ratio in our assessment of the appropriate level of interim dividend to be made. Therefore, the Board has approved an interim dividend of 1.3p per share (H1 2024: 1.94p) payable on 31 January 2025 to shareholders on the register on 10 January 2025, with an ex-dividend date of 9 January 2025.\nScott Cunningham\nChief Financial Officer\n27 November 2024\nConsolidated Interim Statement of Comprehensive Income\nSix months ended 30 September 2024\nUnaudited\n6 months to 30 September 2024\n\u00a3'000\nUnaudited\n6 months to 30 September 2023\n\u00a3'000\nAudited\nYear to 31\nMarch 2024\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n61,950\n62,037\n127,049\nCost of sales\n(28,553)\n(27,550)\n(57,469)\nGross profit\n33,397\n34,487\n69,580\nAdministrative expenses\n(30,123)\n(28,068)\n(56,552)\nOperating profit\n3,274\n6,419\n13,028\nAnalysed as:\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, acquisition costs, exceptional non-recurring costs and share based payments\n16,952\n18,598\n37,728\nShare based payments\n(514)\n(206)\n(517)\nAcquisition costs\n4\n(1,151)\n(538)\n(1,010)\nAdministrative expenses -

Basis of preparation\nThe half yearly financial information does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and included an independent auditor's report, which was unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 493 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe half yearly financial information has been prepared using the same accounting policies and estimation techniques as will be adopted in the Group financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2025. The Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. These half yearly financial statements have been prepared on a consistent basis and format with the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024. The provisions of IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' have not been applied in full.\nGoing concern\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executive's Statement.\nAt the period end, the Group has access to a \u00a3125m multi option revolving credit facility that matures on 30 June 2026, which also benefits from a \u00a325m Accordion Facility. The directors are of the opinion that the Group can operate within the current facility and comply with its banking covenants.\nAt the end of the half year, the Group had net debt of \u00a348.1m (H1 2024: \u00a348.0m). The Board is comfortable with the net debt position given the strong cash generation and considerable financial resources of the Group, together with long\n\u2010\nterm contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks.\nAfter making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to meet its financial obligations and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n2.

The RCF and the Accordion Facility of \u00a325m (if exercised) provide the Group with additional liquidity which will be used for general business purposes and to fund investments, in accordance with the Group's five-year strategic plan. Each draw down made under this facility can be for either 3 or 6 months and can either be repaid or continued at the end of the period. During the year, the Group made a drawdown of \u00a357m (H1 2024: \u00a35.5m).\nDetails of the Group's lease liabilities are included in note 11.\n11.

Post balance sheet events\nAs announced on 1 October 2024, we acquired the entire issued share capital of Kookaburra Topco Limited (\"Kookaburra\"),\u00a0the holding company of Atech Support Limited (together \"Atech\"). Atech is one the UK's most highly accredited Microsoft Solutions Partners and the combination of the two businesses creates a powerful extended set of offerings for mid-market customers, cementing the Group's position as a leading 'Microsoft First' solutions provider in the UK.\nThe initial consideration for the acquisition is \u00a357.0m and was paid in cash on completion on a cash free, normalised working capital and debt free basis under a locked box completion mechanism. The purchase price includes \u00a319.6m of debt repayments and working capital adjustments at completion, with the balance paid to the Kookaburra shareholders. The full purchase price will be financed through a combination of existing bank facilities and cash on the Company's statement of financial position (note 9).\nDue to the proximity of the acquisition date to the financial statements being authorised for issue, IFRS 3 disclosures are not audited or presented.\n13. Availability of half yearly reports\nThe Company's Interim Report for the six months ended 30 September 2024 will shortly be available to view on the Company's website (www.iomart.com).\nINDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO IOMART GROUP PLC\nConclusion\nWe have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 September 2024 which comprises the Consolidated Interim Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Interim Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Interim Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Interim Statement of Changes in Equity and related notes 1 to 13.\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 September 2024 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies the Group intends to use in preparing its next annual financial statements and the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange.\nBasis for Conclusion\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (ISRE (UK) 2410). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nAs disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies the Group intends to use in preparing its next annual financial statements.\nConclusion Relating to Going Concern\nBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for Conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed.\nThis Conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410; however future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\nResponsibilities of the Directors\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange.\nIn preparing the half-yearly financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditors' Responsibilities for the review of the financial information\nIn reviewing the half-yearly financial report, we are responsible for expressing to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report. Our Conclusion, including our Conclusion Relating to Going Concern, are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for Conclusion paragraph of this report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to it in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.\nDeloitte LLP\nStatutory Auditor\n27 November 2024\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
