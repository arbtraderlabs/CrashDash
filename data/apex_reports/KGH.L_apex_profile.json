The business generated revenue of \u00a30.2m and a loss before tax of \u00a30.4m in the period.\n2\nUnderlying PBT excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, revenue, non-underlying finance costs and a gain on disposal of a customer list from an acquired business. Non-underlying revenue and operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses in relation to acquisitions, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations.\nContingent acquisition payments are treated as a non-underlying expense as this represents payments for acquisitions which are dependent on the continued employment of certain individuals in the business for an agreed contractual period after an acquisition of one to three years to preserve the acquired goodwill and customer relationships. Accounting standards require such arrangements to be treated as remuneration in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. However, the individuals also receive market rate salaries, therefore, if not separately identified, these payments would significantly distort the reported results.\n3\nUnderlying EPS is underlying PAT divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.\n4\nLock up is calculated as the combined debtor and WIP days as at a point in time. Debtor days are calculated on a count back basis using the gross debtors at the period end and compared with total fees raised over prior months. WIP days are calculated based on the gross work in progress (excluding that relating to clinical negligence claims, insolvency, and ground rents, as these matters operate mainly on a conditional fee arrangement and a different profile to the rest of the business) and calculating how many days billing this relates to, based on average fees (again excluding clinical negligence claims, insolvency, and ground rents fees) per month for the last 3 months.\nLock up days excludes the impact of acquisitions in the last quarter of the reporting period.\n5\nCash conversion is calculated as the total of cash from operations, less tax paid and underlying IFRS 16 net lease payments, divided by underlying profit after tax.\n6\nNet debt includes cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and acquired debt but excludes lease liabilities.\n7\nChurn is calculated based on the number of qualified fee earners who had been employed by the Group for more than one year. Churn is calculated taking the number of leavers in the above group over the financial year as a percentage of the average number of colleagues for the year. Churn excludes expected churn from acquisitions in the year of acquisition and the first full year post acquisition, redundancies and retirements. Retention is 100% less the churn rate.\nThese footnotes apply throughout the RNS\nA presentation of the results will be made to analysts and investors at 9.00am this morning.

Knights was one of the first law firms in the UK to move from the traditional partnership model to a corporate structure in 2012 and has since grown rapidly. Knights has specialists in all key areas of Corporate and Commercial law and Private Wealth services. It is focussed on key UK markets outside London and currently operates from 32 offices located in Ascot, Basildon, Beaconsfield, Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Cheltenham, Chester, Colchester, Exeter, Kings Hill, Leeds, Leicester, Lincoln, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield, Solihull, Stoke, Teesside, Uxbridge, Weybridge, Wilmslow, Worcester and York.\nChief Executive's Review\nThe first half of the financial year has been one of significant progress for Knights, having returned to organic revenue growth and successfully integrated acquisitions, as we build on the platform we have developed over many years. Our focus remains on sustainable, profitable growth, delivered through disciplined operational and financial management, thoughtful investment, and a commitment to strengthening the quality of our team and diversified service offering.\nA strong first half\nWe delivered a st\nrong performance in the six months to 31 October 2025, with revenue from underlying operati\nons1 rising 30% to \u00a3103.2m (H1 FY25: \u00a379.4m) including organic growth of c.3%. This achievement is particularly pleasing given the broader market backdrop, demonstrating the strength of our diversified service lines, our ability to attract and retain high calibre talent, and the value we are creating through our acquisition strategy.\nUnderlying PBT2 from continuing operations increased to \u00a316.4m, a rise of 12.5% on the comparative period\n(H1 FY25: \u00a314.6m)\n.\nThis represented an underlying PBT margin of 16% (H1 FY25: 18%), which was in line with our expectations as we absorbed higher payroll taxation and the impact of interest rate movements and continued to invest in technology, including AI, where we see opportunities to enhance service delivery, operational efficiency, long-term scalability and strengthen our competitive advantage in the regions.\nReported profit before tax reduced to \u00a32.4m in H1 FY26 (H1 FY25: \u00a39.0m) as a result of higher non- underlying costs relating to the acquisitions in the period and prior years.\nReturned to organic growth\nOur ability to attract ambitious, high-calibre professionals is a key element in driving our organic growth. During the first half, 46 senior fee earners either joined the business or are scheduled to start shortly (H1 FY25: 43), reinforcing our position as a compelling home for top talent who value our corporate structure, culture of collaboration, and opportunity for development\nin a firm of national scale with a growing network of offices.\nThe other key driver of organic growth is staff churn7 which, at an annualised 9% (H1 FY25 annualised: 20%), has remained low in line with the step down achieved in the second half of FY25 (10%), reflecting the positive impact of the engagement and leadership initiatives introduced across the business over the past year.\nThese initiatives include increased mentoring from our Client Services Directors, more face to face time in the offices, and regular forums for colleagues to come together in our Stoke office. They are enabling a stronger team culture and better understanding of the breadth of our services and our business strategy which is supporting greater cross-collaboration, with an increasing number of teams being formed across multiple offices to deliver the best solutions to clients.\nOur enhanced reputation, strong client base and breadth of services position us well to be the leader in local markets, sustain our strong pricing discipline, and be an employer of choice for ambitious professionals who are attracted to the combination of working locally with being able to offer diverse expertise from across our network to their clients. Having grown our number of locations to 32, up from 6 at IPO in June 2018, we also now have access to substantially wider pools of talent.\nStrategically scaling our platform\nIn line with our strategy, the business has continued to successfully scale up, in a disciplined way. This was achieved through acquisitions made in the first half of this year, the effective integration of those made in the prior year, and organic expansion, which substantially extended our presence across the UK - in the West Midlands, the Thames Valley, the South East, and Cardiff.\nCemented our leading position in the Midlands\nWe cemented our leading position in the Midlands by welcoming substantial teams across the West Midlands\nthrough the acquisition of Thursfields Legal Limited which completed in September 2024. The acquisition brought a national client base for its premium services, including a strong private wealth offering, spanning private client, family and residential property, alongside corporate, real estate and dispute resolution services. H\naving integrated the business quickly, it is performing well generating\nrevenues and contributing to profit as expected.\nBuilt scale in the attractive South East market with three acquisiti\nons\nWe have made three acquisitions over the last year, accelerating our growth in the South East region which is an attractive market due to its proximity to areas of inward investment, major corporate clusters and affluent communities. By significantly extending our presence in the region, complementing our existing offices in Kings Hill, Weybridge and Portsmouth, we have created greater opportunities in the region across a diverse suite of premium legal services and are attracting high quality work and talent.\nOur largest acquisition to date, IBB Law LLP, completed in April 2025 bringing offices across the Thames Valley, while extending Knights' existing services across corporate, real estate and private wealth.\nIn June 2025 we completed the acquisition of Birkett Long LLP and Birkett Long IFA LLP with the acquisition of Rix & Kay LLP completing in August 2025. Birkett Long expanded Knights' presence into Essex, extended our existing private client, real estate and corporate service lines further and provided an entry point into financial advisory, which Knights has long considered a complementary service line and growth opportunity. Rix & Kay, a smaller acquisition, strengthened our presence in Kent and Sussex, adding to our existing teams in Brighton and Kings Hill with experts across corporate, commercial property, disputes and private client.\nOverall, we have significantly grown the number of fee earners in the key South East region with all businesses migrated onto our central operational infrastructure, performing well and working closely with our existing teams, a testament to our proven approach to integrating acquisitions effectively.\nEstablished a presence in Cardiff organically, complemented by acquisition\nHaving established a presence in Cardiff through a number of senior fee earner appointments, we acquired Le Gros Solicitors Limited in August 2025, adding a team of six commercial and residential property fee earners.\nThe Cardiff office is not only Knights' first outside England,\nbut was also a predominantly organic opening, built initially around a team of high-quality recruits, aided by the city's proximity to our offices in Bristol and Cheltenham.\nAs part of Knights, all these acquisitions benefit from our well-developed infrastructure and access to\nits wider team of specialists across the country,\nenabling a broader service offering to clients from day one.\nTogether, these additions have not only broadened our geographic footprint but also strengthened our range of capabilities in key areas of demand. With all acquired teams transitioning smoothly into the Group, and performing well, they are now\nproviding strong platforms for ongoing recruitment in new locations, expanding the Group's opportunities for organic growth.\nAcquisitions remain an important part of our growth strategy, and the first half provided further evidence of the strength of our disciplined approach to identifying and integrating businesses with a strong fit. We remain highly selective in our approach and continue to see a solid pipeline of opportunities that would complement our existing platform in the future.\nA continued focus on financial discipline\nWe have maintained a strong focus on financial discipline. Debtor days improved to 32 (H1 FY25: 33) and lock up4 days were reduced to 95 (H1 FY25: 98) as at 31 October 2025, reflecting ongoing focus on working capital management.\nNet debt6 is \u00a375.2m, after c.\u00a315m of acquisition-related cash expenditure during the period and capex of around \u00a33.7m. Cash performance remained strong, and we were pleased to extend our existing \u00a3100m revolving credit facility, for a further year to November 2028 on the same terms. This provides long-term funding to support our growth strategy, including making selective, value-accretive acquisitions.\nInvesting in technology for the future\nAs a legal and professional services business of scale, we are committed to harnessing technology to enhance efficiency and client service.\nDuring the first half, we appointed a Chief Technology Officer who has significant experience in global operations. This is a new role within the Group and will help to enhance our focus on exploring, piloting and developing AI enabled tools and platforms. Our single core platform and one team culture allows us to deploy these new technologies rapidly and consistently, whilst being mindful of security issues.\nIn the first half we have enhanced our document management. We continue to work on other clearly defined initiatives, in particular to improve productivity and service, which will result in a more resilient, agile and scalable business platform.\nWell positioned to leverage our strengthened platform\nHaving worked on the business to put in place effective infrastructure to support growth, including by expanding our operational management team - our Client Services Directors alongside the creation of the new CTO role, and invested in our office network, we feel well placed to support significant growth from our existing platform in the coming periods.\nDividend\nThe Group's progressive dividend policy seeks to maintain a balance between retaining profits to execute our strategy and delivering value for shareholders as our strategy yields positive performances.\nThe Board is, therefore, proposing an interim dividend of 1.94p per share (H1 FY25: 1.76p), an increase of 10%. The dividend will be payable on 13 March 2026 to shareholders on the register at 13 February 2026.\nOutlook\nThe second half has started well, building on the momentum achieved in the first half. We are well positioned to continue to drive organic growth momentum, reflecting the fuller benefit of recent hires combined with strong retention of our existing talent. This, together with a full period contribution from recent acquisitions underpins our confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.\nThe combination of our strengthened platform and operational management structure, ongoing disciplined financial management and approach to harnessing technology, and the growing awareness of our national brand positions Knights well to continue driving sustainable, profitable growth beyond the current financial year.\nWe remain committed to building a stronger, more efficient, scalable and more resilient business that continues to create long-term value for our people, our clients and our shareholders.\nCFO Review\nI am pleased to report another period of profitable, cash generative growth with strong underlying revenue1 growth of 30% to \u00a3103.2m compared to \u00a379.4m in the prior year and underlying EBITDA increased by 19% from the prior year to \u00a325.5m (H1 FY25: \u00a321.4m).\nUnderlying profit before tax increased by 12.5% to \u00a316.4m compared to \u00a314.6m in the prior year. Reported profit before tax (PBT) fell to \u00a32.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a39.0m) due to increased non-underlying costs driven primarily by the increased number of acquisitions completed in the six months, resulting in higher one-off costs from the acquisitions and subsequent restructuring and cost consolidation processes.\nOur continued disciplined approach to financial management has generated excellent cash conversion5 of 122% for the half year enabling us to fund our continuing growth strategy from our existing bank facilities.\nFinancial results\n6 months ended31 October 2025(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n6 months ended31 October 2024(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n% change\nRevenue - underlying\n103,220\n79,414\n30%\nOther operating income\n5,686\n4,857\n17%\nStaff costs\n(62,644)\n(47,697)\n31%\nImpairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n(542)\n(622)\n(13%)\nOther operating charges\n(20,219)\n(14,535)\n39%\nUnderlying EBITDA\n25,501\n21,417\n19%\nUnderlying EBITDA %\n24.7%\n27.0%\nDepreciation charges under IFRS 16\n(2,948)\n(2,499)\n18%\nFinance charges under IFRS 16\n(1,496)\n(1,000)\n50%\nUnderlying EBITDA post IFRS 16 charges\n21,057\n17,918\n18%\nDepreciation and amortisation charges (excluding amortisation on acquired intangibles)\n(2,355)\n(1,571)\n50%\nShare of results of joint ventures\n561\n-\n-\nUnderlying finance costs\n(2,844)\n(1,856)\n53%\nUnderlying finance income\n30\n126\n(76%)\nUnderlying profit before tax\n16,449\n14,617\n13%\nUnderlying profit before tax %\n15.9%\n18.4%\nUnderlying tax charge\n(4,410)\n(3,691)\n19%\nUnderlying profit after tax\n12,039\n10,926\n10%\nBasic underlying EPS (pence)\n14.09\n12.71\n11%\nRevenue\nTotal underlying revenue1 for the half year is \u00a3103.2m compared to \u00a379.4m for the same period last year, an increase of 30%. Of this increase, \u00a321.8m is increased income from FY25 and FY26 acquisitions, with the balance of \u00a32m being growth in organic income.\nOrganic revenues\nWe are pleased to report a return to organic growth of 2.6% in the period reflecting the benefit of continuing strong levels of recruitment of senior fee earners and a substantial reduction in fee earner churn7 over the last twelve months alongside pricing increases and higher revenues in property-related areas which are positively impacted by decreasing mortgage interest rates. Our leading indicators of future organic growth, being recruitment of experienced fee earners with strong client following and reduced levels of churn7, are continuing to improve, supporting expectations of further organic growth in the future.\nRevenue from acquisitions\nDuring FY25 we acquired Thursfields Legal Limited and IBB Law LLP. Both acquisitions completed during FY25 and were fully integrated onto our systems by the end of the financial year. Both acquisitions have performed well during the first half of FY26, accounting for \u00a312.7m of the increase in revenues from H1 FY25.\nIn the six months to 31 October 2025 we acquired Birkett Long LLP, Birkett Long IFA LLP, Rix and Kay Solicitors LLP and Le Gros Solicitors Limited. All acquisitions are fully integrated onto our systems and are performing well, contributing total revenue of \u00a39.1m in the period.\nEmployee costs\nTotal staff costs as a percentage of revenue were 60.7% for the half year (H1 FY25: 60.1%) reflecting the impact of increased payroll taxes of c.\u00a31m in the period, offset by some leverage of support staff costs as the ratio of fee earners to support staff has increased to 3.9:1 as at 31 October 25 compared to 3.7:1 at 31 October 24.\nOther operating income\nAlthough the total value of other operating income has increased by \u00a30.8m, as a percentage of revenue it has decreased from 6.1% in H1 FY25 to 5.5% in H1 FY26 as a result of lower interest rates. The absolute increase in total other operating income is primarily due to increased interest received on client monies (net of monies paid out to clients) due to increased volumes of client monies held (as a result of acquisitions made).\nOther operating charges\nOther operating charges have increased as a percentage of revenue to 19.6% compared to 18.3% in the same period last year. Expenses increased to support the increase in revenue and in the half year we have seen an increase in costs of c.\u00a30.6m relating to further investment in AI and technology.\nUnderlying EBITDA\nDuring the period, underlying EBITDA increased by \u00a34.1m to \u00a325.5m (H1 FY25: \u00a321.4m). Underlying EBITDA margin has decreased to 24.7% (H1 FY25: 27.0%). The 2.3% reduction in EBITDA margin is explained as follows: increased cost due to additional payroll taxes (higher national insurance contributions) accounts for 1.0% (\u00a31m); the reduction of client interest income was 0.7% (\u00a30.7m), and investment in enhanced AI and other technology spend of 0.6% (\u00a30.6m) in the period.\nUnderlying EBITDA excludes non-underlying income and operating costs. Non-underlying operating costs include transaction and onerous lease expenses mainly in relation to acquisitions, contingent consideration and one-off restructuring and professional costs incurred mainly as a result of streamlining the support services in relation to acquisitions. The Board considers this to be a key metric to measure underlying business performance.\nContingent acquisition payments are treated as a non-underlying expense as these represent payments for acquisitions which are dependent on the continued employment of certain individuals in the business for an agreed period of one to three years after an acquisition to preserve the acquired goodwill and customer relationships. Accounting standards require these arrangements to be treated as remuneration in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. However, the individuals also receive market rate salaries and therefore, if not separately identified, these payments would significantly distort the reported results.\nIFRS 16 depreciation and finance charges\nThe IFRS 16 depreciation and finance charges reflect the accounting charges in respect of all leases with a term of over one year. The costs in the period have reduced marginally to 4.3% of revenue (H1 FY25: 4.4%) as we continue to manage our property portfolio to leverage our property costs.\nDepreciation and amortisation charges\nThe charge for the half-year has increased to 2.3% of revenue (H1 FY25: 2.0%) following recent investment in property refurbishments and IT infrastructure.\nShare of results of joint ventures\nThe share of results of joint ventures of \u00a30.6m in the period represents the share of net assets receivable from the Group's joint venture with Convex Corporate Finance Limited.\nFinance charges\nFinance charges, excluding lease interest, increased by \u00a31m in the period to \u00a32.8m (H1 FY25: \u00a31.8m) as a result of the higher net debt6 balance due to cash paid in respect of acquisitions in the current and prior years.\nUnderlying finance income\nThis income related primarily to income recognised from sub-leases of excess space within our property portfolio.\nUnderlying Profit before Tax (PBT)\nUnderlying profit before tax does not include amortisation of acquired intangible assets, transaction expenses and onerous leases (mostly related to acquisitions), contingent payments for acquisitions, disposals of acquired assets, or one-time restructuring and professional fees largely incurred during the streamlining of support functions connected to acquisitions.\nUnderlying profit before tax also excludes profit on sale and related transactions recognised in the period on the sale of non-core areas of business acquired as part of recent acquisitions.\nIn July, we disposed of the legal aid crime business acquired as part of the IBB acquisition. Our exit from this area of the business had been identified as part of the acquisition process. The business was disclosed as held for sale in the year end accounts. During H1 FY26, before it was sold, the business generated income of \u00a30.2m and a loss of \u00a30.4m. This income and related costs are classified as non-underlying in the accounts. A \u00a30.02m profit on disposal is also included within non-underlying transactions for the period.\nAs part of refocussing the financial services business acquired with the Birkett Long acquisition towards higher value work, we have sold a book of clients to a third party enabling us to focus on providing a premium service to higher net worth individuals. Final proceeds are dependent on future income generated by the acquirer of the transferred clients. The accounts for the half year to October 2025 include a gain on disposal of the customer list of \u00a31.1m within non-underlying transactions.\nUnderlying profit before tax (PBT) is calculated to give a clearer picture of business performance and to make it easier to compare profitability from year to year.\n6 months ended31 October 2025(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n6 months ended31 October 2024(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\nProfit before tax\n2,403\n8,974\nNon-underlying revenue\n(247)\n-\nAmortisation on acquired intangibles\n2,693\n1,869\nContingent acquisition payments treated as remuneration\n4,871\n1,447\nOther non-underlying costs\n6,729\n2,327\nUnderlying profit before tax\n16,449\n14,617\nThe Group's underlying PBT2 has increased by 12.5% to \u00a316.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a314.6m).\nThe underling profit before tax margin has decreased to 15.9% compared to 18.4% in the prior period as a result of the reduction in underlying EBITDA margin of 2.3% (explained above), together with the increase in depreciation and finance costs of \u00a32.8m (0.7% reduction), offset by the recognition of the share of results of joint ventures of \u00a30.6m in the period (0.5% contribution).\nReported profit before tax\nThe reported profit before tax in the period has decreased to \u00a32.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a39.0m) due to the increase in non-underlying costs, contingent consideration and amortisation of acquired intangibles.\nTaxation\nThe effective rate of tax on the underlying profit of the business was 27% (H1 FY25: 25%) reflecting the impact of higher disallowable depreciation in the period.\nThe tax charge for the period was \u00a32.7m (H1 FY25: \u00a32.8m). The effective tax rate increased to 111% (H1 FY25: 32%) predominantly due to higher contingent consideration charges which are disallowable for tax purposes.\nEarnings per Share (EPS)\nThe basic underlying EPS3 has increased by 11% to 14.09p per share (H1 FY25: 12.71p). The underlying EPS3 is reflective of the Group underlying performance and provides a meaningful comparison to the prior year.\nThe basic EPS for the period decreased 104% to (0.30p) from 7.14p in the prior year. Taking account of the dilutive impact of potential share options, the basic diluted EPS also reduced to (0.30p) per share (H1 FY25: 6.87p). This reflected the increased effective tax rate explained above.\nThe weighted average number of shares used to calculate the undiluted EPS for the half year was 85,427,787 (H1 FY25: 85,934,299).\nDividend\nIn line with the group's progressive dividend policy, reflecting the improved underlying performance of the Group, balanced with the Board's strategy to continue to reinvest profits to fund future growth plans, the Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.94p per share (H1 FY25: 1.76p per share).\nThis will be a cash only dividend, payable on 13 March 2026 to all shareholders on the register on 13 February 2026.\nBalance Sheet\n31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n31 October 2024\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n30 April 2025 (Audited)\u00a3'000\nGoodwill and Intangible assets\n114,697\n90,877\n105,873\nRight of use assets\n45,034\n37,287\n46,635\nInvestments\n644\n50\n111\nLoan to joint venture\n-\n2,500\n2,000\nProperty, plant and equipment\n25,431\n19,895\n23,685\nAssets & Liabilities held for sale\n1,178\n171\n394\nWorking capital\n68,278\n63,709\n64,640\nOther provisions and deferred tax\n(22,603)\n(15,476)\n(20,272)\nLease liabilities net of lease receivables\n(53,255)\n(42,103)\n(52,529)\n179,404\n156,910\n170,537\nCash and cash equivalents\n8,496\n4,075\n5,853\nBorrowings\n(83,648)\n(54,139)\n(70,682)\nNet debt\n(75,152)\n(50,064)\n(64,829)\nDeferred consideration\n(2,444)\n(2,399)\n(1,175)\nNet assets\n101,808\n104,447\n104,533\nThe Group's net assets at 31 October 2025 are \u00a3101.8m compared to \u00a3104.5m as at 30 April 2025.\nThe decrease of \u00a32.7m was primarily due to the accrued dividends in the period of \u00a32.6m, together with the reported loss of \u00a30.3m generated in the half year.\nWorking capital\nWorking capital is calculated as follows:\n31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n31 October 2024\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n30 April 2025 (Audited)\u00a3'000\nContract assets\n56,965\n48,857\n50,998\nTrade and other receivables\n42,987\n33,009\n39,552\nCorporation tax receivable\n703\n915\n882\nTotal current assets\n100,655\n82,781\n91,432\nTrade and other payables\n(32,197)\n(18,901)\n(26,662)\nContractual liabilities\n(180)\n(171)\n(130)\nTotal current liabilities\n(32,377)\n(19,072)\n(26,792)\nNet working capital\n68,278\n63,709\n64,640\nNet working capital has increased by \u00a33.7m from \u00a364.6m as at 30 April 2025 to \u00a368.3m as at 31 October 2025. Of this increase \u00a32.0m related to working capital acquired as part of acquisitions during the period. The remaining increase relates mainly to an increase in contract assets (work in progress), net of acquisitions, during the year of \u00a33.7m. Although an increase from the position as at 30 April 2025, this increase at half year is as expected following the normal work in progress cycle with work in progress days at 31 October 2025 having reduced by 2 days from the same time last year. The increase in contract assets is offset by an increase in trade payables of \u00a32.1m due to the timing of creditor payments.\nThe management of working capital continues to be a key focus for the Group with strong systems and controls in place to manage the levels of trade receivables and work in progress. The time taken to convert a unit of time incurred into cash is reported as the lock up4 days for the Group and is an important KPI monitored by the Board, Client Services Directors and the wider management team. As at 31 October 2025 lock up4 was 95 days (31 October 2024: 98 days), made up of debtor days of 32 (31 October 2024: 33) and work in progress days of 63 (31 October 2024: 65) demonstrating continued excellence in financial management.\nDue to the disproportionate amount of time that it takes to conclude certain types of work such as CL medilaw, real estate investment and insolvency matters these work types are excluded from our work in progress days calculation as an exception, so as not to distract the majority of the Group from focussing on achieving its excellent lock up4 days. If work in progress days were calculated including all valued work in progress of the Group this would give work in progress days of 98 (31 October 2024: 111) and hence total lock up, with no exclusions, of 130 days as at 31 October 2025 (31 October 2024: 144 days).\nCash flow\n6 months ended\n31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n6 months ended\n31 October 2024 (Unaudited)\u00a3'000\nUnderlying EBITDA\n25,501\n21,417\nChange in working capital\n(5,360)\n(8,388)\nCash outflow for IFRS 16 leases\n(3,466)\n(2,957)\nMovement in underlying share-based payment charge\n735\n445\nCash generated from underlying operations (pre-tax)\n17,410\n10,517\nTax paid\n(2,712)\n(3,617)\nNet cash generated from underlying operating activities\n14,698\n6,900\nUnderlying profit after tax\n12,039\n10,926\nUnderlying cash conversion\n122%\n63%\nCash generation remains a key focus for the Board and management team.

Terms and interest margins remain the same with applicable margins of between 1.65% and 2.55% over SONIA dependant on leverage.\nThe extension of these facilities demonstrates the continued support of our banking partners and ensures the Group has facilities available to enable us to continue to execute our growth strategy into the medium term.\nKnights Group Holdings plc\nConsolidated Statement of

Interim Financial Statements\nFor the 6 month period ended 31 October 2025\n1. General Information\nKnights Group Holdings plc (\"the Company\") is a public company limited by shares and is registered, domiciled and incorporated in England (registration no. 11290101).\nThe Group consists of Knights Group Holdings plc and all of its subsidiaries.\nThe principal activity and nature of operations of the Group is the provision of legal and professional services. The address of its registered office is:\nThe BramptonNewcastle-under-LymeStaffordshireST5 0QW\n2. Accounting policies\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the interim financial information for the six months ended 31 October 2025 are in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK-Adopted International Accounting Standards and are consistent with those which will be adopted in the annual statutory financial statements for the year ending 30 April 2026.\nThe Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2025, prepared under UK-Adopted International Accounting Standards, have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. This interim financial information was approved by the board on 9 January 2026.\nThe financial statements contained in this interim report do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim report has not been audited or reviewed in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.\nMonetary amounts are presented in sterling, being the functional currency of the Group, rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.\n2.2 Going concern\nThe interim financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has a strong trading performance, generates strong operating cashflows and has banking facilities of \u00a3100,000,000, available until November 2028. The Group's forecasts show sufficient cash generation and headroom in banking facilities and covenants by comparison to anticipated future requirements to support the Directors' conclusions that the assumption of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim financial information is appropriate.\nThe Group continues to trade profitably before non-underlying charges and cash generation at an operating cashflow level has remained strong and in line with expectation. In order to satisfy the validity of the going concern assumption, a number of different trading scenarios have been modelled and reviewed. Some of these scenarios forecast a significantly more negative trading performance than is expected. In all of these scenarios the Group remained profitable and with significant headroom in its cash resources for the 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information.\n2.3 Accounting developments\nThere have been no new standards or interpretations relevant to the Group's operations applied in the interim financial information for the first time.\n3.

This includes redundancy costs to streamline the support function of the Group following acquisitions or strategic reorganisations, transaction costs relating primarily to the costs of surrendering acquired contracts and onerous costs in respect of acquisitions, this includes contracts acquired which Knights cannot exit and properties which have become vacant as employees have been moved into right-sized offices in the same region. Also disposals of acquired assets and share-based payment charges relating to one off share schemes offered to employees as part of the IPO and on acquisitions.

The payments extend over periods of one to three years and are designed to preserve the value of goodwill and customer relationships acquired in the business combinations. IFRS requires such arrangements to be treated as remuneration and charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

This strong performance is expected to result in a 12% increase in underlying PBT1 from continuing operations4 to \u00a316.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a314.6m). Group underlying PBT margin, at 16% (H1 FY25: 18%)\nis broadly in line with our internal forecasts as we absorbed higher payroll taxes as anticipated and continued to invest in AI and technology.\nReduced debtor days2\u00a0of 32 as at 31 October 2025 (H1 FY25: 33 days) demonstrated the Group's continued working capital discipline and success in reducing typically higher lock up in acquired businesses. Net debt3\u00a0is expected to be \u00a375.2m, (at 30 April 2025: \u00a364.8m) after c.\u00a315m cash paid in relation to acquisitions and capex of c.\u00a33.5m, reflecting strong underlying cash conversion.\nThe Group has\nsigned\nan extension with HSBC UK, AIB (GB) and NatWest to extend its current revolving credit facility of \u00a3100m for an additional year (on the same terms) until November 2028.\nThe business has continued to scale up, having added substantial teams in the West Midlands, the Thames Valley, the South East, and a smaller team in Cardiff, through acquisitions all of which are performing in line with expectations and integrating well.\nKnights' reputation, collaborative culture, corporate model and growing network of offices continued to attract high calibre talent with 46 senior fee earners joining in the first half or due to start shortly (H1 FY25: 43). Importantly, annualised churn has remained low, in line with the step down in the second half of FY25\ndriven by engagement initiatives across the business.\nDavid Beech, CEO of Knights, commented:\n\"The Group has delivered a strong first half performance, with 30% revenue growth including a return to organic growth. We have continued to scale up the business and have successfully integrated recent acquisitions whilst retaining our strong financial discipline across the business reflected in our strong cash generation.\n\"We expect the second half to benefit from recent hires and a full period contribution from the recent acquisitions, underpinning our confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.\n\"Having put in place an extended operational management structure, we are confident we have the right team to drive the business forward and leverage our strengthened platform as we continue to drive growth beyond the current financial year.\"\nKnights will provide further detail as part of its half year results announcement on 12 January 2026.\nEnds\nFootnotes\n1\nUnderlying PBT excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, and non-underlying finance costs. Non-underlying operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations\n2\nDebtor days are calculated on a count back basis using the gross debtors at the period end and compared with total fees raised over prior months. Debtor days excludes the impact of acquisitions in the last quarter of the reporting period.\n3\nNet debt includes cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and acquired debt but excludes lease liabilities.\n4\nContinuing underlying performance excludes the Crime business which was acquired with IBB Law (completed on 4 April 2025). This business was non-core, as stated at the time of the acquisition, and we completed its sale on 18 July 2025. The business generated revenue of \u00a30.2m and a loss before tax of \u00a30.4m in the period.\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nVia MHP Group\nDeuts\nc\nhe Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP Group (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt, Eleni Menikou\n07884 494112knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue.

The expected profit of \u00a328m is after deduction of share based payment charges of c.\u00a30.5m relating to a new one-off executive share scheme introduced in November 2024.\nThe Group continues to show excellent working capital discipline, with debtor days2\u00a0as at 30 April 2025 of 31 (FY24: 28 days) supporting the Group's strong balance sheet position at the year end. Net debt3 is expected to be c.\u00a365m, (FY24: \u00a335.2m) after c.\u00a330m cash paid in relation to acquisitions.\nThe number of senior fee earners joining the business increased significantly on the prior year (52 new senior fee earners compared to 40 in the prior year), reflecting strong momentum in recruitment. Knights' national scale, strong reputation and uniquely collaborative culture are increasingly attractive to high calibre professionals across the UK regions. In addition, recognition of its corporate model, which is gaining popularity among professional services businesses, is building and offers a compelling alternative to the partnership model, particularly in the current economic environment.\nDuring the year, the Group continued to execute its acquisition strategy. The acquisition of Thursfields, which completed in September, bolstered the Group's position as a leading legal and professional services business in the Midlands. The completion of its largest acquisition to date in April, IBB Law, saw Knights significantly strengthening its presence in the South East of England. These acquisitions are integrating well and performing as expected.\nPost period end, the Group announced a further acquisition in the South East, which not only extended its legal services offering, but provided entry into wealth advisory, an area long considered attractive by the Group. The Group continues to consider selective acquisitions from its healthy pipeline of opportunities, in line with its value accretive acquisition strategy.\nDavid Beech, CEO of Knights, said:\n\"During the year, Knights has made significant progress. It is now recognised as the UK's only legal services firm with true national scale, that retains a strong regional focus. I am particularly pleased with the uptick in fee earners joining the business during the year. As well as our scale, the reputation we have built for quality of service and a unique culture, allows us to recruit the highest quality talent to the business, which in turn, has driven this strong performance.\n\"With the Group experiencing a return to lower levels of churn in the second half of the financial year and positive momentum in the business continuing into the current year, we remain confident in delivering further growth in FY26.\"\nDue to the timing of acquisitions around the year end and the additional financial reporting implications, Knights will announce its full year results in September 2025.\nNotes\n1\nUnderlying PBT is before amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, and non-underlying finance costs.

It brings a team of 91 fee earning professionals delivering premium legal services, with an equal split between service lines for business and private clients. Birkett Long IFA LLP, a separate legal entity (\"the IFA\") which has been established for 30 years, brings a team of 15. Together, they provide the relatively rare ability to offer both legal and wealth advisory services under one roof, and an entry point into financial advisory, which Knights has long considered a complementary service line and growth opportunity.\nIn the year ended 31 May 2024, Birkett Long generated revenues of \u00a314.7m, and corporatised PBT of \u00a31m. Following the acquisition, post integration and full realisation of synergies, Knights expects the business to operate at a low double digit PBT margin. The acquisition is expected to be immediately earnings enhancing and will take Knights' annualised revenue to over \u00a3200m.\nBirkett Long's three locations in Colchester, Chelmsford and Basildon will allow Knights to add further scale in the South East, and expand its presence in a relatively affluent area of the country, offering existing clients a wider range of services supported by the strength and resources of Knights' well-invested central infrastructure.\nThe business is a strong fit culturally and operationally, given its similar private client, real estate and business service lines, giving confidence in a smooth integration.\nTerms of the acquisition\nUnder the terms of the acquisition, Knights will acquire the business from the equity partners for a total consideration of \u00a316.6m, subject to working capital adjustments and on a cash and debt free basis. This comprises an initial cash consideration of \u00a310m, and deferred cash consideration of \u00a36.6m, to be paid in equal instalments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries, subject to certain conditions being met.\nThe consideration will be satisfied from Knights' existing banking facilities. Completion is expected to take place on the 13th of June for Birkett Long LLP. The acquisition of Birkett Long IFA LLP is expected to complete at a later date, as it is subject to FCA consent.\nCommenting on the acquisition, David Beech, CEO of Knights, said:\n\"We are delighted to welcome the Birkett Long team to Knights. This deal significantly expands Knights' presence in the South East, adding scale in areas immediately surrounding London, and provides an entry into wealth advisory, a complementary service which has been of interest to Knights for some time.\n\"We are confident that without the constraints of independent ownership and building on its growth in recent years, the acquisition will deliver further organic growth in the region.\"\nMartin Hopkins, Managing Partner of Birkett Long, commented:\n\"We are excited to be joining Knights following a period of growth and modernisation of our business in recent years. Being part of a business of scale will allow us to build on our track record by continuing to grow revenues across both the law firm and the IFA business, allowing us to provide a broader range of services to our regional clients along with even more career opportunities for our professionals.\n\"We look forward to working closely with the team to offer a broader range of specialisms to our clients and to unlock the significant opportunities in our market.\"\n- ENDS -\n\u200b\nEnquiries\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nKate Lewis, CFO\nVia MHP\nDeutsche Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt,\u00a0Eleni Menikou\n+44 (0)7701308818knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue.

Prudently assuming 20% revenue churn post-acquisition and excluding the non-core Crime business, and following full integration and realisation of synergies, the Board expects it to contribute a PBT margin of circa 26%.\nThe acquisition is expected to be immediately earnings enhancing.\nIBB's four locations in Uxbridge, Beaconsfield, Reading and Ascot provide proximity to areas of inward investment, major corporate clusters, affluent communities and existing Knights offices in Oxford, Weybridge and Newbury, further enhancing our scale in this market.\nIBB has a very good fit with Knights' existing services, given its strengths in corporate, real estate and private wealth, whilst bringing additional specialisms which Knights can build on across the Group, such as in franchising. An exception to this is that the business currently includes a legal aid funded crime business (accounting for c 10% of revenues). Strategic options for this business, which is considered non-core to Knights, will be reviewed following completion.\nThe core IBB business has grown strongly in recent years and is high-performing, with many cultural and operational similarities to Knights - a crucial aspect of Knights' acquisition model, giving confidence that it will integrate well.\nAs part of Knights, IBB will be able to accelerate growth through the team being able to offer clients a wider range of services and utilising the strength and resources of Knights' well-invested central infrastructure, without the increasingly onerous regulatory and technology burden faced by independent firms.\nThe acquisition is, therefore, well-aligned with Knights' strategy to bolster its future organic growth through selective, value enhancing acquisitions.\nTerms of the acquisition\nUnder the terms of the acquisition, Knights will acquire\u00a0IBB from its twenty-nine equity partners for a total consideration of \u00a330m, subject to working capital adjustments and on a cash and debt free basis. This comprises an initial cash consideration of \u00a321m and deferred cash consideration of \u00a39m to be paid in three equal instalments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries following completion, subject to certain conditions being met. The consideration will be satisfied from Knights' existing banking facilities. Completion is expected to take place on 4 April 2025.\nCommenting on the acquisition, David Beech, CEO of Knights, said:\n\"We are delighted to welcome the high quality IBB team to Knights, significantly increasing our scale in the attractive South East region. IBB's premium service offerings in corporate, real estate and private wealth are an excellent fit, and their culture and operational model are very aligned to Knights. We are confident that the acquisition will provide a strong platform for organic growth in the region.\"\nJoanna DeBiase, Managing Partner of IBB, commented:\n\"We are excited about joining Knights at a time of structural change in our industry, where being part of a business of scale with a premium, national reputation is ever more important for all of our stakeholders - allowing us to provide broader services to our clients, strong career opportunities for our people, and to capitalise on our momentum, with the benefit of strong central support.\n\"We look forward to working closely with the team to unlock the significant market opportunities in the South East as part of the larger group.\"\n- ENDS -\nEnquiries\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nKate Lewis, CFO\nVia MHP\nDeutsche Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt,\u00a0Eleni Menikou\n+44 (0)7701308818knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue. Knights was one of the first law firms in the UK to move from the traditional partnership model to a corporate structure in 2012 and has since grown rapidly. Knights has specialists in all key areas of Corporate and Commercial law and Private Wealth services. It is focussed on key UK markets outside London and currently operates from ",

This reflects a 3.0% pts increase in PBT margin to 18.4% (H1 24: 15.4%) and continued strong progression from 12.6% in H1 23. This strong first half performance underscores the Group's confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.\nIn September 2024, the Group acquired Thursfields Legal Limited, a full legal services business with a national client base, significantly strengthening Knights' presence in the West Midlands. The business is integrating well, and is performing in line with expectations.\nMomentum in recruitment continues, with 23 senior professionals joining Knights in the first half (H1 24: 20) and a good pipeline of further hires for the second half, driven by increased brand awareness and a growing reputation across the UK legal services market.\nBalance sheet and Extended Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Group's continued strong focus on working capital discipline is reflected in debtor days2 at 31 October 2024 of 33 (H1 24: 31 days)\n. Net debt3 was \u00a350.1m at 31 October 2024, (at 30 April 2024 : \u00a335.2m) after paying \u00a38.9m initial and deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions.\nThe Group has agreed with HSBC UK, AIB (GB) and NatWest to extend its revolving credit facility to provide total committed funding of \u00a3100m (an increase from the existing \u00a370m) until November 2027 (extended by a year). The extended facility provides the Group with significant headroom to execute its\nvalue-accretive acquisition strategy as suitable opportunities arise.\nUK national insurance\nThe changes announced in the UK Government's Autumn Budget on 30 October, and primarily the changes to national insurance contributions, are expected to have an annualised cost impact of \u00a32m in FY 26, with just one month of the changes impacting FY 25. The Group is well-positioned in relation to these changes through its ongoing focus on growth, efficiency and pricing.\nDavid Beech, CEO of Knights, commented:\n\"It has been a strong first half and I am particularly pleased with our focus on profitable revenue growth. The continued improvement in margin reflects the increasing quality of our revenue, team and our continued focus on the cost base.\n\"We are encouraged by our strong momentum in recruitment which continues to build as Knights' national scale and strong reputation are increasingly recognised. These factors, together with our ongoing focus on operational excellence, and early signs of a recovery in corporate and residential housing work, position us well for a strong performance in the second half in line with market expectations.\"\nKnights will provide a further update on trading with its half year results announcement on 14 January 2025.\nEnds\nNotes\n1\nUnderlying PBT is before amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, and non-underlying finance costs. Non-underlying operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses in relation to acquisitions, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring staff and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations.\n2\nDebtor days are calculated on a count back basis using the gross debtors at the period end and compared with total fees raised over prior months.\n3\nNet debt includes cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and acquired debt but excludes lease liabilities.\nEnquiries\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nKate Lewis\nVia MHP\nDeutsche Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt,\u00a0Eleni Menikou,\u00a0Rob Collett-Creedy\n020 3128 8100+44 (0)7884 494112knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue.

This performance reflected the strength of our diversified service offering, and continued execution against our strategy, and built on our strong track record of profitable growth.\"\n\"Our unique culture continues to be a differentiator for us in the UK legal market and a key driver of our momentum in attracting new talent, through both recruitment and acquisition. This underpins the Board's confidence in the current year.\"\nFurther details can be found on Knights' website:\nhttps://www.knightsplc.com/investors\nFootnotes\n1\nUnderlying PBT is before amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, and non-underlying finance costs. Non-underlying operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses in relation to acquisitions, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring staff and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations.\nContingent acquisition payments are treated as a non-underlying expense as this represents payments for acquisitions which are dependent on the continued employment of certain individuals in the business for an agreed contractual period after an acquisition of one to three years to preserve the acquired goodwill and customer relationships. Accounting standards require such arrangements to be treated as remuneration in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. However, the individuals also receive market rate salaries, therefore, if not separately identified, these payments would significantly distort the reported results.\nEnds\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nVia MHP Group\nDeutshe Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP Group (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt, Eleni Menikou, Rob Collett-Creedy\n020 3128 8100 / 07884 494112knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue.

Since inception, Thursfields has transformed from a traditional law firm into a corporatised, premium provider of legal services to a national client base.\nThe firm has a strong Private Wealth offering, spanning Private Client, Family and Residential Property, alongside Corporate, Real Estate and Dispute Resolution services. The acquisition sees 101 fee earning professionals join Knights and significantly strengthens the Group's presence in the West Midlands.\nThe acquisition is well-aligned with Knights' strategy to bolster its future organic growth through selective, considered acquisitions. It further extends Knights' existing capabilities in Private Wealth, while bringing a high-quality team and national client base, which will benefit from Knights' wider range of services and its established platform.\nIn its unaudited accounts for the year ended 30 April 2024, Thursfields reported revenue of \u00a311.2m and a PBT margin of circa\u00a025%. Following full integration and realisation of synergies, the Board expects it to contribute a PBT margin of circa 30%\n.\nAccounting for a typical level of revenue attrition post-acquisition, the acquisition is expected to be immediately earnings enhancing.\nTerms of the acquisition\nUnder the terms of the acquisition, Knights will acquire\nThursfields Legal Limited from its ten shareholders on a debt free, cash free basis, for a total consideration of c.\u00a312.5m. This comprises initial cash consideration of c.\u00a37.5m and deferred cash consideration of \u00a35.0m to be paid in three equal instalments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries following completion. The cash consideration will be satisfied from Knights' existing banking facilities. Completion is expected to take place on 14 September 2024.\nCommenting on the acquisition, David Beech, CEO of Knights, said:\n\"We are delighted to acquire Thursfields, a premium, full-service law firm which shares many cultural and operational similarities to Knights, and significantly strengthens our position as a leading legal and professional services business in the Midlands.\n\"With particular strength in Private Wealth, it further enhances our expertise in an important and growing part of our business, which will support our future growth plans.\nMichelle O'Hara, Managing Partner at Thursfields commented:\n\"Knights is a business with a similar ethos to Thursfields, with a strong culture which cultivates collaboration across its offices, to the benefit of client service.\n\"We look forward to working closely with the team and leveraging Knights' scale, reputation and extensive capabilities, to unlock our future growth potential.\"\n- ENDS -\nEnquiries\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nKate Lewis, CFO\nVia MHP\nDeutsche Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt,\u00a0Eleni Menikou,\u00a0Rob Collett-Creedy\n+44 (0)7701308818knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing, legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue.

Non-underlying operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses in relation to acquisitions, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring staff and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations.\nContingent acquisition payments are treated as a non-underlying expense as this represents payments for acquisitions which are dependent on the continued employment of certain individuals in the business for an agreed contractual period after an acquisition of one to three years to preserve the acquired goodwill and customer relationships. Accounting standards require such arrangements to be treated as remuneration in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. However, the individuals also receive market rate salaries, therefore, if not separately identified, these payments would significantly distort the reported results.\n2\nUnderlying EPS is underlying PAT divided by the weight",

My average in is below 100p and I've trimmed already; was thinking about increasing my holding again but the lack of detail on the above makes me a little nervous. Also I suspect mgmt / analysts have kept consensus flat (\u00a329m adj PBT) despite the Thrusfield acquisition which should add \u00a31-2m to profits this year (\u00a32-3m annual PBT). Having said that I still think its cheap - probably around 5x EV/EBIT (\u00a3115m mcap, maybe \u00a355m net debt, \u00a3170m EV vs I guess c.\u00a333m EBIT this year). Note I've adjusted the net debt figure for the high capex this year (\u00a311m) and acquisition payments and contingent consideration payments due in subsequent years...",

And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least. I no expert on the technical side of things but to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty good at the moment also?",

Like you I see significant upside as this stock hit 480 in 2021 and was substantially less profitable than today. The CEO David Beech is the founder and still the largest shareholder with 17M shares. Beech sold 15.7M shares when Knights floated at 390 per share and pocketed 61.8M Professional Services is a hot sector for Private Equity who have been very active in the Accounting arena. I think the only way Beech can cash in for another big number is either a Sale to PE or a Merger with one of the USA players. I'm thinking 500 !!",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term. CEO still owns north of 20% of the company so is pretty well aligned with shareholders here I think, even if he has sold a bunch and made a lot of money already.",

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

And then after that there were a number of bigger trades that went through and over the last 40 mins of trading that drove the price down. But not massive trades, it looks like less than 100k shares in total, which isn't much in the context of a \u00a3160m mcap business. But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19). And they've been paying a divi over that period also. Hey ho, different views are what makes a market I guess...",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move! But it does feel like this share has been testing this 190-200p level for a while and seems to have FINALLY broken out, and to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty bullish.

This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT.

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

Now they have reloaded, they are at it again for another drop. I still have my holding, but the 15 minute trade was quite funny. Goes to show that selling it was the right idea. I have another quality company in my pf, AFM where the same is happening. Its down 20% in 2 days. I have done the same there, but not sold yet, as no bounce, but crazy valuation for what it is. May well sell some rubbish today and increase here.",

Anyway it was there for a couple of weeks and appeared to never fill and disappeared. Robbie got his target of course before this recent fall but this piqued my interest and I bought today at 78. Whether that buy order ever got filled I don't know but it would explain the recent rise if it did. Not sure why it fell recently but it started falling after SPT fell from grace, no relation it seems but you never know in the market",

I was planning this earlier in the week, and it would have been Aviva instead of L&G, but TO news has spiked the price today. The new pf sits alongside my extreme high risk crazy 'bottom picker', which is where I first found KGH, and where I took the 15 minute trade. Bottom picker currently down >40% (it turned out NOT to be the bottom on a few!), but I'm very excited about its prospects again over 2 years. I thought we might see a spike down around 2pm (normally do with shorts), but I could wait as have work this afternoon. AFM is a bargain if anybody cares..",

After seeing the recovery I'm quite sure that traders (not investors) got spooked last week. Now I know NT is involved and his people are, it explains it all now.

I bought another small cap, which is in the position that Knights was around a year ago. Well under half of its fair value, still recovering from a few recent issues. I think that is what attracted me to Knights, being able to buy as low as the 70's. with a 50% upside. I note there was a lot more discussion on this board back at that time, have most sold out as well? I was prompted to post here today as I found this rating from Shore capital, which has a target price of 115p - and yes it was published after the latest results. TBH, I would like to buy these back, but Im not interested in paying above 115 for them after ExD. The Investors Chronical also rates these as a hold and has them on a PE of 11, which disagrees somewhat with Shore's PE of 5 even taking in to account the rise in SP. The shore article is a little contradictory expecting the shares to re rate, but the price is already above their fair value target.  I can see the 115 target on the research portal of IC, so its not a typo. The median target here is 160. I have shares that have dropped on weak earnings with higher % targets than this after they have been down graded - AFM today for example, \"Analyst Calum Battersby retained his \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 420p on the consultancy group\" that is a 25% upside target after a downgrade. All makes me thinks Knights is around fair value, and not much of an income play. (AFM is not my new small cap, im stuck in there over a year). Shore Capital makes a strong case for resilient Knights Group Legal services company Knights Group (KGH) is trading on an \u2018undemanding\u2019 valuation and has scope to rerate, says Shore Capital. Analyst Jamie Murray retained his \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and \u2018fair value\u2019 target price of 115p on the stock, which was trading at 121p on Friday. It reported \u2018resilient\u2019 first half 2024 results, which \u2018highlighted that management is executing its renewed strategy to focus on organic growth\u2019, Murray said. \u2018The outlook is positive with non-cyclical legal activity showing resilience and recruitment initiatives increasing fee earner headcount,\u2019 he explained. Although Knights is a \u2018well-regarded law firm with as strong presence outside of London which enables it to win market share\u2019, Murray said the shares trade on an \u2018undemanding price/earnings target of 5x\u2019. \u2018We expect this to increase following these resilient results,\u2019 he said. \u2018If management continue to execute its new strategy focused on organic growth, we think it can rerate to a multiple more in-line with the sector.\u2019",

Also I suspect mgmt / analysts have kept consensus flat (\u00a329m adj PBT) despite the Thrusfield acquisition which should add \u00a31-2m to profits this year (\u00a32-3m annual PBT). Having said that I still think its cheap - probably around 5x EV/EBIT (\u00a3115m mcap, maybe \u00a355m net debt, \u00a3170m EV vs I guess c.\u00a333m EBIT this year).

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least. I no expert on the technical side of things but to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty good at the moment also?",

Beech sold 15.7M shares when Knights floated at 390 per share and pocketed 61.8M Professional Services is a hot sector for Private Equity who have been very active in the Accounting arena. I think the only way Beech can cash in for another big number is either a Sale to PE or a Merger with one of the USA players. I'm thinking 500 !!",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term. CEO still owns north of 20% of the company so is pretty well aligned with shareholders here I think, even if he has sold a bunch and made a lot of money already.",

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

The three leg movement is defined as an initial fall, followed by a brief rally, then a second fall. If the sp, does drop to the described range, then the retracement could be considered completed, with the equity to resume the upward trend.

And then after that there were a number of bigger trades that went through and over the last 40 mins of trading that drove the price down. But not massive trades, it looks like less than 100k shares in total, which isn't much in the context of a \u00a3160m mcap business. But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19). And they've been paying a divi over that period also. Hey ho, different views are what makes a market I guess...",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move! But it does feel like this share has been testing this 190-200p level for a while and seems to have FINALLY broken out, and to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty bullish.

This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now.

I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT.

Only thing I can think is weak sentiment to UK focused stocks after the fumbled budget. Or just a bit of technical pressure with Octopus reducing their stake. Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021. Will probably continue to drift until their half year results on 12th Jan as doubt there will be any news flow over the xmas period. Probably a good time to top up if I can get through the next couple of weeks results etc unscathed!",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.  We expect this inertia to unwind in H2\". SO this implies another 3% organic growth which should be deferred to H2.

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move! But it does feel like this share has been testing this 190-200p level for a while and seems to have FINALLY broken out, and to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty bullish.

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors.

This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT.

          "content": "Solid results, no real surprises to the upside or down. Looks like they might be marginally ahead of expectations for FY on rev / profit, and maybe will beat on cash / debt. Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

Just to make sure they have no exposure as there was one paragraph in the results that was slightly ambiguous (to my untrained eye anyway) as to whether they engaged in litigation funding. This was the email: \u2018I just have a quick question regarding yesterday's supreme court ruling. I notice the following paragraph in your recent year end results.... Certain contingent fee arrangements are undertaken on a partially funded basis. In such arrangements, the funded portion of fees is not contingent on the successful outcome of the litigation and in these instances the revenue is recognised up to the amount of fees that the Group is entitled to bill for services performed to date based on contracted rates. The remaining consideration is variable and conditional on the successful resolution of the litigation. The variable consideration is recognised over the duration of the matter and included in revenue based on the expected amount recoverable only to the extent that it is highly probable that the amount recognised will not be subject to significant reversal when the uncertainty is resolved at that point in time. Do you expect that these arrangements will be effected by yesterday's ruling?\u2019 This Morning I received the following reply from the CFO which I found very helpful. So thought I\u2019d share for the benefit of others: \u2018Good morning Further to your email below, the ruling by the Supreme Court will not have any impact on our business. We do not have any funding agreements within the business that fall into the category covered by the ruling. Many thanks Kate\u2019",

I held it for 15 minutes and sold it back at 85p around 4:20. That rise after such a drop is typical of a short, taking back the stock it has dumped. Now they have reloaded, they are at it again for another drop. I still have my holding, but the 15 minute trade was quite funny. Goes to show that selling it was the right idea. I have another quality company in my pf, AFM where the same is happening. Its down 20% in 2 days. I have done the same there, but not sold yet, as no bounce, but crazy valuation for what it is. May well sell some rubbish today and increase here.",

Anyway it was there for a couple of weeks and appeared to never fill and disappeared. Robbie got his target of course before this recent fall but this piqued my interest and I bought today at 78. Whether that buy order ever got filled I don't know but it would explain the recent rise if it did. Not sure why it fell recently but it started falling after SPT fell from grace, no relation it seems but you never know in the market",

I was planning this earlier in the week, and it would have been Aviva instead of L&G, but TO news has spiked the price today. The new pf sits alongside my extreme high risk crazy 'bottom picker', which is where I first found KGH, and where I took the 15 minute trade. Bottom picker currently down >40% (it turned out NOT to be the bottom on a few!), but I'm very excited about its prospects again over 2 years. I thought we might see a spike down around 2pm (normally do with shorts), but I could wait as have work this afternoon. AFM is a bargain if anybody cares..",

After seeing the recovery I'm quite sure that traders (not investors) got spooked last week. Now I know NT is involved and his people are, it explains it all now. Strip out an unexpected 35% of earnings in any company you follow and still see if it is still cheap. Those drops Rag surely have to be the RB effect.",

I bought another small cap, which is in the position that Knights was around a year ago. Well under half of its fair value, still recovering from a few recent issues. I think that is what attracted me to Knights, being able to buy as low as the 70's. with a 50% upside. I note there was a lot more discussion on this board back at that time, have most sold out as well? I was prompted to post here today as I found this rating from Shore capital, which has a target price of 115p - and yes it was published after the latest results. TBH, I would like to buy these back, but Im not interested in paying above 115 for them after ExD. The Investors Chronical also rates these as a hold and has them on a PE of 11, which disagrees somewhat with Shore's PE of 5 even taking in to account the rise in SP. The shore article is a little contradictory expecting the shares to re rate, but the price is already above their fair value target.  I can see the 115 target on the research portal of IC, so its not a typo. The median target here is 160. I have shares that have dropped on weak earnings with higher % targets than this after they have been down graded - AFM today for example, \"Analyst Calum Battersby retained his \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 420p on the consultancy group\" that is a 25% upside target after a downgrade. All makes me thinks Knights is around fair value, and not much of an income play. (AFM is not my new small cap, im stuck in there over a year). Shore Capital makes a strong case for resilient Knights Group Legal services company Knights Group (KGH) is trading on an \u2018undemanding\u2019 valuation and has scope to rerate, says Shore Capital. Analyst Jamie Murray retained his \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and \u2018fair value\u2019 target price of 115p on the stock, which was trading at 121p on Friday. It reported \u2018resilient\u2019 first half 2024 results, which \u2018highlighted that management is executing its renewed strategy to focus on organic growth\u2019, Murray said. \u2018The outlook is positive with non-cyclical legal activity showing resilience and recruitment initiatives increasing fee earner headcount,\u2019 he explained. Although Knights is a \u2018well-regarded law firm with as strong presence outside of London which enables it to win market share\u2019, Murray said the shares trade on an \u2018undemanding price/earnings target of 5x\u2019. \u2018We expect this to increase following these resilient results,\u2019 he said. \u2018If management continue to execute its new strategy focused on organic growth, we think it can rerate to a multiple more in-line with the sector.\u2019",

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.  We expect this inertia to unwind in H2\". SO this implies another 3% organic growth which should be deferred to H2.

Only thing I can think is weak sentiment to UK focused stocks after the fumbled budget. Or just a bit of technical pressure with Octopus reducing their stake. Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021. Will probably continue to drift until their half year results on 12th Jan as doubt there will be any news flow over the xmas period.

Trading update last week showed everything is still in line and despite the uncertainty around the budget etc the business is still growing and performing as expected. As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period. I actually think this could prove pretty conservative as in reality they will continue to acquire / integrate businesses and will be bigger / more profitable than forecasts currently suggest by that point in time...",

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors. These acquisitions are all integrating well, with working capital benefits coming through under Knights\u2019 ownership. From this strong performance, management is confident in achieving FY26E expectations. Whilst Knights\u2019 share price has risen 16% in the past two months, it still only trades on 6x cal 2026 PER, a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth, with net financial debt / EBITDA only 1.4x (FY26E).

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move!

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19). And they've been paying a divi over that period also. Hey ho, different views are what makes a market I guess...",

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

And then after that there were a number of bigger trades that went through and over the last 40 mins of trading that drove the price down. But not massive trades, it looks like less than 100k shares in total, which isn't much in the context of a \u00a3160m mcap business. But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term. CEO still owns north of 20% of the company so is pretty well aligned with shareholders here I think, even if he has sold a bunch and made a lot of money already.",

Beech sold 15.7M shares when Knights floated at 390 per share and pocketed 61.8M Professional Services is a hot sector for Private Equity who have been very active in the Accounting arena.

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least. I no expert on the technical side of things but to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty good at the moment also?",

My average in is below 100p and I've trimmed already; was thinking about increasing my holding again but the lack of detail on the above makes me a little nervous. Also I suspect mgmt / analysts have kept consensus flat (\u00a329m adj PBT) despite the Thrusfield acquisition which should add \u00a31-2m to profits this year (\u00a32-3m annual PBT). Having said that I still think its cheap - probably around 5x EV/EBIT (\u00a3115m mcap, maybe \u00a355m net debt, \u00a3170m EV vs I guess c.\u00a333m EBIT this year).

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.

Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021.

Trading update last week showed everything is still in line and despite the uncertainty around the budget etc the business is still growing and performing as expected. As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period.

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors. These acquisitions are all integrating well, with working capital benefits coming through under Knights\u2019 ownership. From this strong performance, management is confident in achieving FY26E expectations. Whilst Knights\u2019 share price has risen 16% in the past two months, it still only trades on 6x cal 2026 PER, a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range.

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move!

Not on their website yet... I still think the valuation here is silly, even given the lack of growth last year.

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19). And they've been paying a divi over that period also. Hey ho, different views are what makes a market I guess...",

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

But not massive trades, it looks like less than 100k shares in total, which isn't much in the context of a \u00a3160m mcap business. But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

If the sp, does drop to the described range, then the retracement could be considered completed, with the equity to resume the upward trend.

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term. CEO still owns north of 20% of the company so is pretty well aligned with shareholders here I think, even if he has sold a bunch and made a lot of money already.",

Beech sold 15.7M shares when Knights floated at 390 per share and pocketed 61.8M Professional Services is a hot sector for Private Equity who have been very active in the Accounting arena.

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least. I no expert on the technical side of things but to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty good at the moment also?",

My average in is below 100p and I've trimmed already; was thinking about increasing my holding again but the lack of detail on the above makes me a little nervous. Also I suspect mgmt / analysts have kept consensus flat (\u00a329m adj PBT) despite the Thrusfield acquisition which should add \u00a31-2m to profits this year (\u00a32-3m annual PBT). Having said that I still think its cheap - probably around 5x EV/EBIT (\u00a3115m mcap, maybe \u00a355m net debt, \u00a3170m EV vs I guess c.\u00a333m EBIT this year).

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.

Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021.

Trading update last week showed everything is still in line and despite the uncertainty around the budget etc the business is still growing and performing as expected. As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period. I actually think this could prove pretty conservative as in reality they will continue to acquire / integrate businesses and will be bigger / more profitable than forecasts currently suggest by that point in time...",

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors. These acquisitions are all integrating well, with working capital benefits coming through under Knights\u2019 ownership. From this strong performance, management is confident in achieving FY26E expectations. Whilst Knights\u2019 share price has risen 16% in the past two months, it still only trades on 6x cal 2026 PER, a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range.

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move!

And they're basically 5 months into FY26 already given the late release of results, so they should have decent visibility of trading ytd already... Did anyone listen to the investor call? Not on their website yet... I still think the valuation here is silly, even given the lack of growth last year. FY28 forecasts are for \u00a347m operating profit, and will have paid off essentially all contingent consideration by then, so net debt will be about \u00a355m. Should be trading at 7-8x EBIT in my view (v conservatively), which would be EV \u00a3330-375m, Mcap of \u00a3275-320m, and share price at least double where we are now.

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19). And they've been paying a divi over that period also. Hey ho, different views are what makes a market I guess...",

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

By my numbers Knights is on about 6.9X EV/EBIT, so a 10-15% discount to Gateley... - Mcap 165m - Net debt 65m + 10m for recent Birket Long deal = \u00a375m.

But I think -GTLY should be more highly rated. It's not the most exciting business but is a consistent performer that has proven resilience through the cycle -KGH should trade at a premium, as it has done historically, due to its higher growth proven buy and build model - I also think over time the upside from degearing the balance sheet will also be material which is less a factor for Gateley Still see a route to 300p+ on these in the short-medium term.",

The three leg movement is defined as an initial fall, followed by a brief rally, then a second fall. If the sp, does drop to the described range, then the retracement could be considered completed, with the equity to resume the upward trend.

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term.

Beech sold 15.7M shares when Knights floated at 390 per share and pocketed 61.8M Professional Services is a hot sector for Private Equity who have been very active in the Accounting arena.

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least.

My average in is below 100p and I've trimmed already; was thinking about increasing my holding again but the lack of detail on the above makes me a little nervous. Also I suspect mgmt / analysts have kept consensus flat (\u00a329m adj PBT) despite the Thrusfield acquisition which should add \u00a31-2m to profits this year (\u00a32-3m annual PBT). Having said that I still think its cheap - probably around 5x EV/EBIT (\u00a3115m mcap, maybe \u00a355m net debt, \u00a3170m EV vs I guess c.\u00a333m EBIT this year).

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.  We expect this inertia to unwind in H2\". SO this implies another 3% organic growth which should be deferred to H2.

Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021.

Trading update last week showed everything is still in line and despite the uncertainty around the budget etc the business is still growing and performing as expected. As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period.

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors.

From this strong performance, management is confident in achieving FY26E expectations. Whilst Knights\u2019 share price has risen 16% in the past two months, it still only trades on 6x cal 2026 PER, a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range.

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move!

Not on their website yet... I still think the valuation here is silly, even given the lack of growth last year.

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19). And they've been paying a divi over that period also. Hey ho, different views are what makes a market I guess...",

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

But I think -GTLY should be more highly rated. It's not the most exciting business but is a consistent performer that has proven resilience through the cycle -KGH should trade at a premium, as it has done historically, due to its higher growth proven buy and build model - I also think over time the upside from degearing the balance sheet will also be material which is less a factor for Gateley Still see a route to 300p+ on these in the short-medium term.",

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term.

Beech sold 15.7M shares when Knights floated at 390 per share and pocketed 61.8M Professional Services is a hot sector for Private Equity who have been very active in the Accounting arena.

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least.

Slightly unusual to only refer to last years PBT growth (already reported with the FY results in July) with no commentary or figures on trading other than saying they are in line with consensus... My average in is below 100p and I've trimmed already; was thinking about increasing my holding again but the lack of detail on the above makes me a little nervous. Also I suspect mgmt / analysts have kept consensus flat (\u00a329m adj PBT) despite the Thrusfield acquisition which should add \u00a31-2m to profits this year (\u00a32-3m annual PBT). Having said that I still think its cheap - probably around 5x EV/EBIT (\u00a3115m mcap, maybe \u00a355m net debt, \u00a3170m EV vs I guess c.\u00a333m EBIT this year).

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.

Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021.

Trading update last week showed everything is still in line and despite the uncertainty around the budget etc the business is still growing and performing as expected. As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period.

They did announce on their website yesterday they've awarded 31 training contracts to some graduates / juniors, which I guess is a positive indicator of organic growth, although surely that's is not that material. Also saw this re their Sheffield office: https://www.thestar.co.uk/business/knights-sheffield-office-celebrates-first-year-with-ps363m-in-deals-and-award-recognition-5342506 The other thing (which I've pointed out before) is if you look at a share chart, after getting above the recent high of c.200p there's isn't any resistance levels all the way up to 250+ ish I think. And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move! But it does feel like this share has been testing this 190-200p level for a while and seems to have FINALLY broken out, and to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty bullish. The only other things I can think would be an analyst releasing a new note or upgrading forecasts, but I've not seen anything. Or an institutional seller cleared / a new buyer emerged but can't see any particularly big trades recently.",

FY25 revenues rose 8% to \u00a3162m, with operating leverage driving Adj. PBT up 11% and margin up 40bps to 17.3%. Investment in offices and acquisitions, along with encouraging current trading, underpins our forecasts for profitable growth. Yet the stock is trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and hence the shares are well below our 230p fair value. We also examine the strength of its differentiated \u201ccorporatised law\u201d business model. As an active consolidator in the premium regional legal market, Knights has funded over 20 acquisitions in the past 12 years, culminating in group revenues rising 8% to \u00a3162m in FY25 and \u00a3200m+ in FY26E (a 13-year CAGR of 27%). Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Yet, its valuation is at a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. Trading on only c.5x cal 2026 PER and offering a c.16% cal FCF yield (pre-acquisitions) we see scope for a significant rerating.",

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19).

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

It's not the most exciting business but is a consistent performer that has proven resilience through the cycle -KGH should trade at a premium, as it has done historically, due to its higher growth proven buy and build model - I also think over time the upside from degearing the balance sheet will also be material which is less a factor for Gateley Still see a route to 300p+ on these in the short-medium term.",

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term.

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least.

Knights are universally disliked in the legal profession, which is why many of the good partners who join via a Knights acquisition, take their cash consideration as soon as they can and then leave for a better firm. Yet....the CEO sold shares for \u00a350m personally when the price was at a peak. Dont get fooled again! DYOR",

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.

Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021.

Trading update last week showed everything is still in line and despite the uncertainty around the budget etc the business is still growing and performing as expected. As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now. Interesting to think that in 2021 this share was trading at 400p ish. It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period.

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors. These acquisitions are all integrating well, with working capital benefits coming through under Knights\u2019 ownership. From this strong performance, management is confident in achieving FY26E expectations. Whilst Knights\u2019 share price has risen 16% in the past two months, it still only trades on 6x cal 2026 PER, a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth, with net financial debt / EBITDA only 1.4x (FY26E). We see scope for a significant rerating and reiterate our 230p/ share fair value estimate.",

They did announce on their website yesterday they've awarded 31 training contracts to some graduates / juniors, which I guess is a positive indicator of organic growth, although surely that's is not that material. Also saw this re their Sheffield office: https://www.thestar.co.uk/business/knights-sheffield-office-celebrates-first-year-with-ps363m-in-deals-and-award-recognition-5342506 The other thing (which I've pointed out before) is if you look at a share chart, after getting above the recent high of c.200p there's isn't any resistance levels all the way up to 250+ ish I think. And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move! But it does feel like this share has been testing this 190-200p level for a while and seems to have FINALLY broken out, and to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty bullish. The only other things I can think would be an analyst releasing a new note or upgrading forecasts, but I've not seen anything. Or an institutional seller cleared / a new buyer emerged but can't see any particularly big trades recently.",

Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%.

I'm comfortable on all these points. Would argue the unravelling has already happened with this stock back in 2022 when it went from 400p to 150p. It was a) overrated and b) getting too much credit for the buy and build model and c) traded on a big premium to Gateley. As I've argued I think the opposite is true now at the current valuation on all three fronts. I'm up a fair chunk on my holding even after the pull back in the last few days, but think there is still a lot more to go for. In due course I suspect the CEO will want out, and suspect this will be taken private. Private Equity loves a buy and build, and will value the consistency of their revenues / cash generation more than the lack of high organic growth.",

I think since listing they have had one year of negative organic growth (-3% FY21, ie Covid, creditable performance IMHO), and one year of flat growth (-0.1% in FY23); the rest have shown organic growth. Admittedly the growth rate is lower today compared to the double digit organic growth they were doing pre-covid; but of course you need to take into account the weaker economic backdrop. They also exited some smaller non-core activities in 2023 (and probably at other points also). My view is the organic growth will pick up when the economic backdrop improves as M&A work and residential property work has been subdued now for a while. And besides, that they've tripled their revenues and profits since listing, whilst only increasing their share count by about 15%, is good evidence their buy and build model works... Net debt is only up about \u00a360m (\u00a315m to \u00a375m) over that time, whilst EBITDA is up about \u00a337m (\u00a348m FY26 vs \u00a311m in FY19).

          "content": "F15: How do you figure / calculate organic growth being negative? Overall they've said they'll do \u00a3162m this year vs \u00a3150 last year. Y/E is end April 2025. Of the incremental \u00a312m I make from M&A: - IBB Law, approx c.\u00a32m (less than 1 month of the reported \u00a323m revenue). Completed early April 2025 - Thrusfields, approx c.\u00a37m (7.5 months of reported \u00a311.2m revenue). Completed mid Sept 2024 - St James Law and Baines Wilson c.\u00a31m (maybe 2 months of reported \u00a36.5, revenue). Not sure when completed but announce early May 2023, ie 10-11 months will fall in FY24, so only an incremental 1-2 months in FY25 vs FY24 - Convex JV is small and accounted for using equity method, ie the revenues won't be consolidated so not applicable to revenue calculations AFAIK So I make about \u00a310m incremental revenue max from M&A in FY25, with about \u00a32m from organic growth. Which is 1-2% organic growth. Actually it should be higher than this, as they normally expect about 20% revenue churn from new acquisitions (and they state this), so it may be more like \u00a38m from M&A and \u00a34m from organic growth, ie 2-3% organic growth. I'd say 'modest' is probably an appropriate term to describe this level of growth. For FY26 they are currently forecast to do \u00a3193m revenue, which is \u00a331m incremental to FY25. Similar logic says: - \u00a321m from IBB Law, \u00a34m from Thursfield max. \u00a325m total - Birket Long maybe \u00a312.5m incremental (completion mid June 2025, total annual revenue \u00a314.7m) Total incremental from M&A of \u00a337m, which does imply a reduction of max \u00a35-6m. BUT applying similar 20% revenue churn to M&A, it gets you to \u00a330m from M&A and again a \u00a31-2m incremental from organic. They do actually say in the RNS about Birkett Long that it brings their annualised revenue to 'over \u00a3200m' which possibly implies forecasts for FY26 are a little conservative currently and would imply continued 3% ish organic growth... The announcement was in May so of course it assumes things haven't got a chunk worse in the month or two since then. On debt, they will have about \u00a375m net debt currently after Birkett Long payment, vs forecast \u00a348.5m EBITDA for FY26. ie leverage of about 1.5x; still a decent amount of headroom, and they will generate cash through the year, especially now their office refit is complete. Happy to be taken to task on any of the above! Of course I'd love organic growth to be higher, and think it will be when macro environment improves. But, respectfully, I don't think you are characterising the business correctly in terms of both the growth profile and the level of debt.",

But not massive trades, it looks like less than 100k shares in total, which isn't much in the context of a \u00a3160m mcap business. But I'm guessing there may be more selling to come behind that, hence the drop. But (in the absence of any actual news) seems to be the classic illiquid microcap getting hit disproportionately by pretty marginal selling. On twitter / X there is some healthy debate around the buy and build model (which I am comfortable with having looked at in detail, and think builds value long term), the debt levels (again I'm comfortable) and the weak backdrop in UK legal services (fair point but think overstated given GTLY today and last trading statement). I think some folk underestimate the cashflow the underlying business generates, especially with capex due to come down materially now their office refit is complete. Either one should take into account the significant growth the buy and build model generates, whilst critiquing the use of cash for M&A. OR one should consider the organic growth which is much more modest - but in this case look at underlying cash generation excl M&A. Some people out there penalise this stock BOTH for the spend on M&A, AND whilst criticising the stock for low growth excluding M&A - overly harsh in my view. But anyway this debate has been on going for a while, couldn't find anything new today... Lets see what tomorrow brings...",

It's not the most exciting business but is a consistent performer that has proven resilience through the cycle -KGH should trade at a premium, as it has done historically, due to its higher growth proven buy and build model - I also think over time the upside from degearing the balance sheet will also be material which is less a factor for Gateley Still see a route to 300p+ on these in the short-medium term.",

The thing that gets me excited is that this sort of level would not be expensive vs the fundamental valuation of the company vs the market and vs the historic rating. I know some are concerned about the impact of rate cuts (which seem to be uncertain at this stage given inflation anyway! And in any case are slow and in small increments), but from what I can work out I think any impact on their PBT will be small and will be offset to some extent by less interest paid on their borrowings, and possibly stronger trading in certain more cyclical areas of their business (eg property). Also as they grow / do acquisitions, their client cash balances will continue to grow also, which again offsets some of the downward pressure from rates.",

But the business is more than 3x the size in both revenue and profit terms now, so they have more than tripled the size of the business whilst only increasing the share count by less than 20%. This is basically the proof that their M&A model works and is generally funded by cashflow from the underlying business (and not by issuing shares / dilution) and drives value over the long term even if it means the balance sheet will always have a bit of debt and deferred consideration lingering on it. Not sure I can get to 500p unless there is a very generous acquirer, but with a bit of organic growth, some more bolt on deals, and rerating to eg 12x PE (not crazy in my books) I can see 350-400p in the medium term.

It went from very loved to very hated back in 2022 - seems to me the reality is somewhere in between. I like the model, like the market and think mgmt have a good track record of creating value over the long term here (and yes also creating value for themselves). Think due a FY trading update in a couple of weeks. And have done two reasonably decent deals so far in FY25 (ie after the march year end) which should drive some upgrades to FY26 and beyond, but also will increase debt I guess (although not for the FY results coming). And yes more deferred consideration, but that is the model here and deferred consideration is better than paying all upfront in cash (as no interest cost!). Gateley's results were cautiously positive, with 3% organic growth, so hopefully Knights can get to around that level. M&A seems to have picked up a bit which should help and I think property market has also improved a little which might also help. Also will be watching capex spend - it was very high in FY24 and FY25 as they undertook a big office refit programme, so hoping this comes down materially in their guidance for FY26 although we might not get that much detail until their FY results I guess around July time.... I think this is still very cheap for what you get here. Quality business and decent long term growth story in a defensive sector. I think its trading on about 5.8x PE! Or about 6.5x EV/EBIT even if you treat all the deferred consideration as debt. Can argue those are about 50% too cheap at least.

Utterly ridiculous. Knights are universally disliked in the legal profession, which is why many of the good partners who join via a Knights acquisition, take their cash consideration as soon as they can and then leave for a better firm. Yet....the CEO sold shares for \u00a350m personally when the price was at a peak. Dont get fooled again! DYOR",

Organic growth at 3% when it should really be higher, expecting 5% for the full year so H2 should be better but they didn't give anything quantitative about H2 trading other than that it was building on momentum and in line with expectations. Gateley growing faster organically, proves it can be done if mgmt get it right. Hopefully the lower staff churn and new recruits will start to deliver and we'll see an acceleration. As ever there are a few wrinkles - high exceptionals in the period (M&A related), organic growth a bit low (see above) but importantly is positive number now, capex still higher than where it should be in my view for this sort of business given they have finished their refurb programme now, and margins trajectory could be better but mainly impacted by things outside their control. Having said that I still think this business is an absolute steal at 6.5x PE. Hoping that they have an H2 without any M&A so that there is a clean period of organic growth, cash generation and deleveraging of the balance sheet. Only 3.5 months left in their FY, so they should have high visibility to the FY numbers, and can get on to the front foot for FY27 come April. Organic growth plus stabilisation / improvement of margins, plus cash generation plus a few more sensible deals... And sentiment to this could finally begin to turn more positive; rerating to 8-10x PE is eminently achievable to my mind in the near term - 240-300p. 12x would not be an outrageous rating to expect on continued delivery, which would be 350-400p longer term.",

They also said \"We estimate that pre-Budget transactional inertia impacted H1 revenue by circa \u00a33m, which if delivered in H1 would have resulted in H1 margins consistent with full year expectations.

Looking at the register, could do with a few more 'blue chip' institutional investors in this. For a company of this size (\u00a3130m+ mcap) you would expect more interest. Used to be absolutely loved by the market, I guess fund managers have long memories after being burned by this in 2021.

As ever would hope organic growth improves from 3% in H1 to the 5% that they guided to for the full year a short time ago... This is now trading on 5.8x EV/EBIT, 6.4 PE, for a growing business that is performing well and that throws off cash. Although net debt has increased, they have paid off a substantial amount of deferred consideration in the last few years, as of now only \u00a317m ish remains. Balance sheet well below 2x geared now.

It's now less than half that, despite revenue (\u00a3100m to \u00a3200m) and operating profit (\u00a320m to 40m) having doubled in the period since... I still think this gets to 320-370p over the next 2-3 years - and that's not assuming anything other than hitting their forecasts and a modest rerating to 7-8x EV/EBIT. Plus you'll get 16p+ in dividends over that period. I actually think this could prove pretty conservative as in reality they will continue to acquire / integrate businesses and will be bigger / more profitable than forecasts currently suggest by that point in time...",

Knights\u2019 H126 revenues rose an impressive 30% to \u00a3103.2m as a return to organic growth of 3% was complemented by the recent strategic acquisitions of IBB Law, Birkett Long, Rix & Kay and Le Gros Solicitors. These acquisitions are all integrating well, with working capital benefits coming through under Knights\u2019 ownership. From this strong performance, management is confident in achieving FY26E expectations. Whilst Knights\u2019 share price has risen 16% in the past two months, it still only trades on 6x cal 2026 PER, a significant discount to peers and its historic trading range. In our view, Knights offers a compelling mix of organic and acquisitive growth, with net financial debt / EBITDA only 1.4x (FY26E). We see scope for a significant rerating and reiterate our 230p/ share fair value estimate.",

And possibly 300p+. Although I'm not a technicals guy (anyone else on here that is want to have a better stab?) and kinda hate myself for reverting to this as an explanation for a share price move! But it does feel like this share has been testing this 190-200p level for a while and seems to have FINALLY broken out, and to my untrained eye the chart looks pretty bullish. The only other things I can think would be an analyst releasing a new note or upgrading forecasts, but I've not seen anything. Or an institutional seller cleared / a new buyer emerged but can't see any particularly big trades recently.",

Good pricing discipline and a focus on operational excellence has seen average revenues per fee-earner rise 12% and underlying PBT margins rose 40bps to 17.3%.

I note their consensus revenue forecast for FY26 is now \u00a3199m (up from \u00a3193m last time I looked). Consensus PBT for FY26 also nudged up to \u00a333m from \u00a332m. So both up 3% or so. But think these upgrades were from earlier - their website says 21st August. Given they are 4 months into FY26 already it implies they're pretty comfortable with trading to date and outlook (which is probably another couple of months visibility on top of the 4 that have gone).",
