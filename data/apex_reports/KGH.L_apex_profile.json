          "content": "20 Nov 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 8682M\nKnights Group Holdings PLC\n20 November 2024\nKnights Group Holdings plc\n(\"Knights\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nTrading update for the six months ended 31 October 2024\nStrong margin improvement, revolving credit facility extended\nConfident in delivering a FY performance in line with market expectations\nKnights, the national legal and professional services business, today provides a trading update for the six months ended 31 October 2024.\nThe Group has delivered a strong performance in the period with underlying PBT1 expected to increase by 25.9% to c.\u00a314.6m (H1 24: \u00a311.6m), on anticipated revenue growth of 5.4% to c.\u00a379.4m (H1 24: \u00a375.3m). This reflects a 3.0% pts increase in PBT margin to 18.4% (H1 24: 15.4%) and continued strong progression from 12.6% in H1 23. This strong first half performance underscores the Group's confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.\nIn September 2024, the Group acquired Thursfields Legal Limited, a full legal services business with a national client base, significantly strengthening Knights' presence in the West Midlands. The business is integrating well, and is performing in line with expectations.\nMomentum in recruitment continues, with 23 senior professionals joining Knights in the first half (H1 24: 20) and a good pipeline of further hires for the second half, driven by increased brand awareness and a growing reputation across the UK legal services market.\nBalance sheet and Extended Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Group's continued strong focus on working capital discipline is reflected in debtor days2 at 31 October 2024 of 33 (H1 24: 31 days)\n. Net debt3 was \u00a350.1m at 31 October 2024, (at 30 April 2024 : \u00a335.2m) after paying \u00a38.9m initial and deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions.\nThe Group has agreed with HSBC UK, AIB (GB) and NatWest to extend its revolving credit facility to provide total committed funding of \u00a3100m (an increase from the existing \u00a370m) until November 2027 (extended by a year). The extended facility provides the Group with significant headroom to execute its\nvalue-accretive acquisition strategy as suitable opportunities arise.\nUK national insurance\nThe changes announced in the UK Government's Autumn Budget on 30 October, and primarily the changes to national insurance contributions, are expected to have an annualised cost impact of \u00a32m in FY 26, with just one month of the changes impacting FY 25. The Group is well-positioned in relation to these changes through its ongoing focus on growth, efficiency and pricing.\nDavid Beech, CEO of Knights, commented:\n\"It has been a strong first half and I am particularly pleased with our focus on profitable revenue growth. The continued improvement in margin reflects the increasing quality of our revenue, team and our continued focus on the cost base.\n\"We are encouraged by our strong momentum in recruitment which continues to build as Knights' national scale and strong reputation are increasingly recognised. These factors, together with our ongoing focus on operational excellence, and early signs of a recovery in corporate and residential housing work, position us well for a strong performance in the second half in line with market expectations.\"\nKnights will provide a further update on trading with its half year results announcement on 14 January 2025.\nEnds\nNotes\n1\nUnderlying PBT is before amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, and non-underlying finance costs. Non-underlying operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses in relation to acquisitions, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring staff and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations.\n2\nDebtor days are calculated on a count back basis using the gross debtors at the period end and compared with total fees raised over prior months.\n3\nNet debt includes cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and acquired debt but excludes lease liabilities.\nEnquiries\nKnights\nDavid Beech, CEO\nKate Lewis\nVia MHP\nDeutsche Numis (Nomad and Broker)\nStuart Skinner, Kevin Cruickshank\n020 7260 1000\nMHP (Media enquiries)\nKatie Hunt,\u00a0Eleni Menikou,\u00a0Rob Collett-Creedy\n020 3128 8100+44 (0)7884 494112knights@mhpgroup.com\nNotes to Editors\nKnights is a fast-growing legal and professional services business, ranked within the UK's top 50 largest law firms by revenue.
