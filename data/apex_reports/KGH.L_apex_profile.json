We have also significantly expanded our presence in the South East, and Wales, whilst effectively integrating prior period acquisitions including our largest to date.\nLooking further ahead, the combination of our strengthened platform and operational management structure, ongoing disciplined financial management, approach to harnessing technology, and the growing awareness of our national brand, positions Knights well to continue driving sustainable, profitable growth beyond the current financial year.\"\nFootnotes\n1\nUnderlying revenue excludes the Crime business which was acquired with IBB Law (completed on 4 April 2025). This business was non-core, as stated at the time of the acquisition, and we completed its sale on 18 July 2025. The business generated revenue of \u00a30.2m and a loss before tax of \u00a30.4m in the period.\n2\nUnderlying PBT excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles, non-underlying operating expenses, revenue, non-underlying finance costs and a gain on disposal of a customer list from an acquired business. Non-underlying revenue and operating expenses include transaction and onerous lease expenses in relation to acquisitions, contingent acquisition payments, disposal of acquired assets, along with one-off restructuring and professional expenses, mainly incurred on acquisitions, through streamlining support functions or strategic reorganisations.\nContingent acquisition payments are treated as a non-underlying expense as this represents payments for acquisitions which are dependent on the continued employment of certain individuals in the business for an agreed contractual period after an acquisition of one to three years to preserve the acquired goodwill and customer relationships. Accounting standards require such arrangements to be treated as remuneration in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. However, the individuals also receive market rate salaries, therefore, if not separately identified, these payments would significantly distort the reported results.\n3\nUnderlying EPS is underlying PAT divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.\n4\nLock up is calculated as the combined debtor and WIP days as at a point in time. Debtor days are calculated on a count back basis using the gross debtors at the period end and compared with total fees raised over prior months. WIP days are calculated based on the gross work in progress (excluding that relating to clinical negligence claims, insolvency, and ground rents, as these matters operate mainly on a conditional fee arrangement and a different profile to the rest of the business) and calculating how many days billing this relates to, based on average fees (again excluding clinical negligence claims, insolvency, and ground rents fees) per month for the last 3 months.\nLock up days excludes the impact of acquisitions in the last quarter of the reporting period.\n5\nCash conversion is calculated as the total of cash from operations, less tax paid and underlying IFRS 16 net lease payments, divided by underlying profit after tax.\n6\nNet debt includes cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and acquired debt but excludes lease liabilities.\n7\nChurn is calculated based on the number of qualified fee earners who had been employed by the Group for more than one year. Churn is calculated taking the number of leavers in the above group over the financial year as a percentage of the average number of colleagues for the year. Churn excludes expected churn from acquisitions in the year of acquisition and the first full year post acquisition, redundancies and retirements. Retention is 100% less the churn rate.\nThese footnotes apply throughout the RNS\nA presentation of the results will be made to analysts and investors at 9.00am this morning.

Knights was one of the first law firms in the UK to move from the traditional partnership model to a corporate structure in 2012 and has since grown rapidly. Knights has specialists in all key areas of Corporate and Commercial law and Private Wealth services. It is focussed on key UK markets outside London and currently operates from 32 offices located in Ascot, Basildon, Beaconsfield, Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Cheltenham, Chester, Colchester, Exeter, Kings Hill, Leeds, Leicester, Lincoln, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield, Solihull, Stoke, Teesside, Uxbridge, Weybridge, Wilmslow, Worcester and York.\nChief Executive's Review\nThe first half of the financial year has been one of significant progress for Knights, having returned to organic revenue growth and successfully integrated acquisitions, as we build on the platform we have developed over many years. Our focus remains on sustainable, profitable growth, delivered through disciplined operational and financial management, thoughtful investment, and a commitment to strengthening the quality of our team and diversified service offering.\nA strong first half\nWe delivered a st\nrong performance in the six months to 31 October 2025, with revenue from underlying operati\nons1 rising 30% to \u00a3103.2m (H1 FY25: \u00a379.4m) including organic growth of c.3%. This achievement is particularly pleasing given the broader market backdrop, demonstrating the strength of our diversified service lines, our ability to attract and retain high calibre talent, and the value we are creating through our acquisition strategy.\nUnderlying PBT2 from continuing operations increased to \u00a316.4m, a rise of 12.5% on the comparative period\n(H1 FY25: \u00a314.6m)\n.\nThis represented an underlying PBT margin of 16% (H1 FY25: 18%), which was in line with our expectations as we absorbed higher payroll taxation and the impact of interest rate movements and continued to invest in technology, including AI, where we see opportunities to enhance service delivery, operational efficiency, long-term scalability and strengthen our competitive advantage in the regions.\nReported profit before tax reduced to \u00a32.4m in H1 FY26 (H1 FY25: \u00a39.0m) as a result of higher non- underlying costs relating to the acquisitions in the period and prior years.\nReturned to organic growth\nOur ability to attract ambitious, high-calibre professionals is a key element in driving our organic growth. During the first half, 46 senior fee earners either joined the business or are scheduled to start shortly (H1 FY25: 43), reinforcing our position as a compelling home for top talent who value our corporate structure, culture of collaboration, and opportunity for development\nin a firm of national scale with a growing network of offices.\nThe other key driver of organic growth is staff churn7 which, at an annualised 9% (H1 FY25 annualised: 20%), has remained low in line with the step down achieved in the second half of FY25 (10%), reflecting the positive impact of the engagement and leadership initiatives introduced across the business over the past year.\nThese initiatives include increased mentoring from our Client Services Directors, more face to face time in the offices, and regular forums for colleagues to come together in our Stoke office. They are enabling a stronger team culture and better understanding of the breadth of our services and our business strategy which is supporting greater cross-collaboration, with an increasing number of teams being formed across multiple offices to deliver the best solutions to clients.\nOur enhanced reputation, strong client base and breadth of services position us well to be the leader in local markets, sustain our strong pricing discipline, and be an employer of choice for ambitious professionals who are attracted to the combination of working locally with being able to offer diverse expertise from across our network to their clients. Having grown our number of locations to 32, up from 6 at IPO in June 2018, we also now have access to substantially wider pools of talent.\nStrategically scaling our platform\nIn line with our strategy, the business has continued to successfully scale up, in a disciplined way. This was achieved through acquisitions made in the first half of this year, the effective integration of those made in the prior year, and organic expansion, which substantially extended our presence across the UK - in the West Midlands, the Thames Valley, the South East, and Cardiff.\nCemented our leading position in the Midlands\nWe cemented our leading position in the Midlands by welcoming substantial teams across the West Midlands\nthrough the acquisition of Thursfields Legal Limited which completed in September 2024. The acquisition brought a national client base for its premium services, including a strong private wealth offering, spanning private client, family and residential property, alongside corporate, real estate and dispute resolution services. H\naving integrated the business quickly, it is performing well generating\nrevenues and contributing to profit as expected.\nBuilt scale in the attractive South East market with three acquisiti\nons\nWe have made three acquisitions over the last year, accelerating our growth in the South East region which is an attractive market due to its proximity to areas of inward investment, major corporate clusters and affluent communities. By significantly extending our presence in the region, complementing our existing offices in Kings Hill, Weybridge and Portsmouth, we have created greater opportunities in the region across a diverse suite of premium legal services and are attracting high quality work and talent.\nOur largest acquisition to date, IBB Law LLP, completed in April 2025 bringing offices across the Thames Valley, while extending Knights' existing services across corporate, real estate and private wealth.\nIn June 2025 we completed the acquisition of Birkett Long LLP and Birkett Long IFA LLP with the acquisition of Rix & Kay LLP completing in August 2025. Birkett Long expanded Knights' presence into Essex, extended our existing private client, real estate and corporate service lines further and provided an entry point into financial advisory, which Knights has long considered a complementary service line and growth opportunity. Rix & Kay, a smaller acquisition, strengthened our presence in Kent and Sussex, adding to our existing teams in Brighton and Kings Hill with experts across corporate, commercial property, disputes and private client.\nOverall, we have significantly grown the number of fee earners in the key South East region with all businesses migrated onto our central operational infrastructure, performing well and working closely with our existing teams, a testament to our proven approach to integrating acquisitions effectively.\nEstablished a presence in Cardiff organically, complemented by acquisition\nHaving established a presence in Cardiff through a number of senior fee earner appointments, we acquired Le Gros Solicitors Limited in August 2025, adding a team of six commercial and residential property fee earners.\nThe Cardiff office is not only Knights' first outside England,\nbut was also a predominantly organic opening, built initially around a team of high-quality recruits, aided by the city's proximity to our offices in Bristol and Cheltenham.\nAs part of Knights, all these acquisitions benefit from our well-developed infrastructure and access to\nits wider team of specialists across the country,\nenabling a broader service offering to clients from day one.\nTogether, these additions have not only broadened our geographic footprint but also strengthened our range of capabilities in key areas of demand. With all acquired teams transitioning smoothly into the Group, and performing well, they are now\nproviding strong platforms for ongoing recruitment in new locations, expanding the Group's opportunities for organic growth.\nAcquisitions remain an important part of our growth strategy, and the first half provided further evidence of the strength of our disciplined approach to identifying and integrating businesses with a strong fit. We remain highly selective in our approach and continue to see a solid pipeline of opportunities that would complement our existing platform in the future.\nA continued focus on financial discipline\nWe have maintained a strong focus on financial discipline. Debtor days improved to 32 (H1 FY25: 33) and lock up4 days were reduced to 95 (H1 FY25: 98) as at 31 October 2025, reflecting ongoing focus on working capital management.\nNet debt6 is \u00a375.2m, after c.\u00a315m of acquisition-related cash expenditure during the period and capex of around \u00a33.7m. Cash performance remained strong, and we were pleased to extend our existing \u00a3100m revolving credit facility, for a further year to November 2028 on the same terms. This provides long-term funding to support our growth strategy, including making selective, value-accretive acquisitions.\nInvesting in technology for the future\nAs a legal and professional services business of scale, we are committed to harnessing technology to enhance efficiency and client service.\nDuring the first half, we appointed a Chief Technology Officer who has significant experience in global operations. This is a new role within the Group and will help to enhance our focus on exploring, piloting and developing AI enabled tools and platforms. Our single core platform and one team culture allows us to deploy these new technologies rapidly and consistently, whilst being mindful of security issues.\nIn the first half we have enhanced our document management. We continue to work on other clearly defined initiatives, in particular to improve productivity and service, which will result in a more resilient, agile and scalable business platform.\nWell positioned to leverage our strengthened platform\nHaving worked on the business to put in place effective infrastructure to support growth, including by expanding our operational management team - our Client Services Directors alongside the creation of the new CTO role, and invested in our office network, we feel well placed to support significant growth from our existing platform in the coming periods.\nDividend\nThe Group's progressive dividend policy seeks to maintain a balance between retaining profits to execute our strategy and delivering value for shareholders as our strategy yields positive performances.\nThe Board is, therefore, proposing an interim dividend of 1.94p per share (H1 FY25: 1.76p), an increase of 10%. The dividend will be payable on 13 March 2026 to shareholders on the register at 13 February 2026.\nOutlook\nThe second half has started well, building on the momentum achieved in the first half. We are well positioned to continue to drive organic growth momentum, reflecting the fuller benefit of recent hires combined with strong retention of our existing talent. This, together with a full period contribution from recent acquisitions underpins our confidence in delivering a full year performance in line with market expectations.\nThe combination of our strengthened platform and operational management structure, ongoing disciplined financial management and approach to harnessing technology, and the growing awareness of our national brand positions Knights well to continue driving sustainable, profitable growth beyond the current financial year.\nWe remain committed to building a stronger, more efficient, scalable and more resilient business that continues to create long-term value for our people, our clients and our shareholders.\nCFO Review\nI am pleased to report another period of profitable, cash generative growth with strong underlying revenue1 growth of 30% to \u00a3103.2m compared to \u00a379.4m in the prior year and underlying EBITDA increased by 19% from the prior year to \u00a325.5m (H1 FY25: \u00a321.4m).\nUnderlying profit before tax increased by 12.5% to \u00a316.4m compared to \u00a314.6m in the prior year. Reported profit before tax (PBT) fell to \u00a32.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a39.0m) due to increased non-underlying costs driven primarily by the increased number of acquisitions completed in the six months, resulting in higher one-off costs from the acquisitions and subsequent restructuring and cost consolidation processes.\nOur continued disciplined approach to financial management has generated excellent cash conversion5 of 122% for the half year enabling us to fund our continuing growth strategy from our existing bank facilities.\nFinancial results\n6 months ended31 October 2025(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n6 months ended31 October 2024(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n% change\nRevenue - underlying\n103,220\n79,414\n30%\nOther operating income\n5,686\n4,857\n17%\nStaff costs\n(62,644)\n(47,697)\n31%\nImpairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n(542)\n(622)\n(13%)\nOther operating charges\n(20,219)\n(14,535)\n39%\nUnderlying EBITDA\n25,501\n21,417\n19%\nUnderlying EBITDA %\n24.7%\n27.0%\nDepreciation charges under IFRS 16\n(2,948)\n(2,499)\n18%\nFinance charges under IFRS 16\n(1,496)\n(1,000)\n50%\nUnderlying EBITDA post IFRS 16 charges\n21,057\n17,918\n18%\nDepreciation and amortisation charges (excluding amortisation on acquired intangibles)\n(2,355)\n(1,571)\n50%\nShare of results of joint ventures\n561\n-\n-\nUnderlying finance costs\n(2,844)\n(1,856)\n53%\nUnderlying finance income\n30\n126\n(76%)\nUnderlying profit before tax\n16,449\n14,617\n13%\nUnderlying profit before tax %\n15.9%\n18.4%\nUnderlying tax charge\n(4,410)\n(3,691)\n19%\nUnderlying profit after tax\n12,039\n10,926\n10%\nBasic underlying EPS (pence)\n14.09\n12.71\n11%\nRevenue\nTotal underlying revenue1 for the half year is \u00a3103.2m compared to \u00a379.4m for the same period last year, an increase of 30%. Of this increase, \u00a321.8m is increased income from FY25 and FY26 acquisitions, with the balance of \u00a32m being growth in organic income.\nOrganic revenues\nWe are pleased to report a return to organic growth of 2.6% in the period reflecting the benefit of continuing strong levels of recruitment of senior fee earners and a substantial reduction in fee earner churn7 over the last twelve months alongside pricing increases and higher revenues in property-related areas which are positively impacted by decreasing mortgage interest rates. Our leading indicators of future organic growth, being recruitment of experienced fee earners with strong client following and reduced levels of churn7, are continuing to improve, supporting expectations of further organic growth in the future.\nRevenue from acquisitions\nDuring FY25 we acquired Thursfields Legal Limited and IBB Law LLP. Both acquisitions completed during FY25 and were fully integrated onto our systems by the end of the financial year. Both acquisitions have performed well during the first half of FY26, accounting for \u00a312.7m of the increase in revenues from H1 FY25.\nIn the six months to 31 October 2025 we acquired Birkett Long LLP, Birkett Long IFA LLP, Rix and Kay Solicitors LLP and Le Gros Solicitors Limited. All acquisitions are fully integrated onto our systems and are performing well, contributing total revenue of \u00a39.1m in the period.\nEmployee costs\nTotal staff costs as a percentage of revenue were 60.7% for the half year (H1 FY25: 60.1%) reflecting the impact of increased payroll taxes of c.\u00a31m in the period, offset by some leverage of support staff costs as the ratio of fee earners to support staff has increased to 3.9:1 as at 31 October 25 compared to 3.7:1 at 31 October 24.\nOther operating income\nAlthough the total value of other operating income has increased by \u00a30.8m, as a percentage of revenue it has decreased from 6.1% in H1 FY25 to 5.5% in H1 FY26 as a result of lower interest rates. The absolute increase in total other operating income is primarily due to increased interest received on client monies (net of monies paid out to clients) due to increased volumes of client monies held (as a result of acquisitions made).\nOther operating charges\nOther operating charges have increased as a percentage of revenue to 19.6% compared to 18.3% in the same period last year. Expenses increased to support the increase in revenue and in the half year we have seen an increase in costs of c.\u00a30.6m relating to further investment in AI and technology.\nUnderlying EBITDA\nDuring the period, underlying EBITDA increased by \u00a34.1m to \u00a325.5m (H1 FY25: \u00a321.4m). Underlying EBITDA margin has decreased to 24.7% (H1 FY25: 27.0%). The 2.3% reduction in EBITDA margin is explained as follows: increased cost due to additional payroll taxes (higher national insurance contributions) accounts for 1.0% (\u00a31m); the reduction of client interest income was 0.7% (\u00a30.7m), and investment in enhanced AI and other technology spend of 0.6% (\u00a30.6m) in the period.\nUnderlying EBITDA excludes non-underlying income and operating costs. Non-underlying operating costs include transaction and onerous lease expenses mainly in relation to acquisitions, contingent consideration and one-off restructuring and professional costs incurred mainly as a result of streamlining the support services in relation to acquisitions. The Board considers this to be a key metric to measure underlying business performance.\nContingent acquisition payments are treated as a non-underlying expense as these represent payments for acquisitions which are dependent on the continued employment of certain individuals in the business for an agreed period of one to three years after an acquisition to preserve the acquired goodwill and customer relationships. Accounting standards require these arrangements to be treated as remuneration in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. However, the individuals also receive market rate salaries and therefore, if not separately identified, these payments would significantly distort the reported results.\nIFRS 16 depreciation and finance charges\nThe IFRS 16 depreciation and finance charges reflect the accounting charges in respect of all leases with a term of over one year. The costs in the period have reduced marginally to 4.3% of revenue (H1 FY25: 4.4%) as we continue to manage our property portfolio to leverage our property costs.\nDepreciation and amortisation charges\nThe charge for the half-year has increased to 2.3% of revenue (H1 FY25: 2.0%) following recent investment in property refurbishments and IT infrastructure.\nShare of results of joint ventures\nThe share of results of joint ventures of \u00a30.6m in the period represents the share of net assets receivable from the Group's joint venture with Convex Corporate Finance Limited.\nFinance charges\nFinance charges, excluding lease interest, increased by \u00a31m in the period to \u00a32.8m (H1 FY25: \u00a31.8m) as a result of the higher net debt6 balance due to cash paid in respect of acquisitions in the current and prior years.\nUnderlying finance income\nThis income related primarily to income recognised from sub-leases of excess space within our property portfolio.\nUnderlying Profit before Tax (PBT)\nUnderlying profit before tax does not include amortisation of acquired intangible assets, transaction expenses and onerous leases (mostly related to acquisitions), contingent payments for acquisitions, disposals of acquired assets, or one-time restructuring and professional fees largely incurred during the streamlining of support functions connected to acquisitions.\nUnderlying profit before tax also excludes profit on sale and related transactions recognised in the period on the sale of non-core areas of business acquired as part of recent acquisitions.\nIn July, we disposed of the legal aid crime business acquired as part of the IBB acquisition. Our exit from this area of the business had been identified as part of the acquisition process. The business was disclosed as held for sale in the year end accounts. During H1 FY26, before it was sold, the business generated income of \u00a30.2m and a loss of \u00a30.4m. This income and related costs are classified as non-underlying in the accounts. A \u00a30.02m profit on disposal is also included within non-underlying transactions for the period.\nAs part of refocussing the financial services business acquired with the Birkett Long acquisition towards higher value work, we have sold a book of clients to a third party enabling us to focus on providing a premium service to higher net worth individuals. Final proceeds are dependent on future income generated by the acquirer of the transferred clients. The accounts for the half year to October 2025 include a gain on disposal of the customer list of \u00a31.1m within non-underlying transactions.\nUnderlying profit before tax (PBT) is calculated to give a clearer picture of business performance and to make it easier to compare profitability from year to year.\n6 months ended31 October 2025(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n6 months ended31 October 2024(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\nProfit before tax\n2,403\n8,974\nNon-underlying revenue\n(247)\n-\nAmortisation on acquired intangibles\n2,693\n1,869\nContingent acquisition payments treated as remuneration\n4,871\n1,447\nOther non-underlying costs\n6,729\n2,327\nUnderlying profit before tax\n16,449\n14,617\nThe Group's underlying PBT2 has increased by 12.5% to \u00a316.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a314.6m).\nThe underling profit before tax margin has decreased to 15.9% compared to 18.4% in the prior period as a result of the reduction in underlying EBITDA margin of 2.3% (explained above), together with the increase in depreciation and finance costs of \u00a32.8m (0.7% reduction), offset by the recognition of the share of results of joint ventures of \u00a30.6m in the period (0.5% contribution).\nReported profit before tax\nThe reported profit before tax in the period has decreased to \u00a32.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a39.0m) due to the increase in non-underlying costs, contingent consideration and amortisation of acquired intangibles.\nTaxation\nThe effective rate of tax on the underlying profit of the business was 27% (H1 FY25: 25%) reflecting the impact of higher disallowable depreciation in the period.\nThe tax charge for the period was \u00a32.7m (H1 FY25: \u00a32.8m). The effective tax rate increased to 111% (H1 FY25: 32%) predominantly due to higher contingent consideration charges which are disallowable for tax purposes.\nEarnings per Share (EPS)\nThe basic underlying EPS3 has increased by 11% to 14.09p per share (H1 FY25: 12.71p). The underlying EPS3 is reflective of the Group underlying performance and provides a meaningful comparison to the prior year.\nThe basic EPS for the period decreased 104% to (0.30p) from 7.14p in the prior year. Taking account of the dilutive impact of potential share options, the basic diluted EPS also reduced to (0.30p) per share (H1 FY25: 6.87p). This reflected the increased effective tax rate explained above.\nThe weighted average number of shares used to calculate the undiluted EPS for the half year was 85,427,787 (H1 FY25: 85,934,299).\nDividend\nIn line with the group's progressive dividend policy, reflecting the improved underlying performance of the Group, balanced with the Board's strategy to continue to reinvest profits to fund future growth plans, the Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.94p per share (H1 FY25: 1.76p per share).\nThis will be a cash only dividend, payable on 13 March 2026 to all shareholders on the register on 13 February 2026.\nBalance Sheet\n31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n31 October 2024\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n30 April 2025 (Audited)\u00a3'000\nGoodwill and Intangible assets\n114,697\n90,877\n105,873\nRight of use assets\n45,034\n37,287\n46,635\nInvestments\n644\n50\n111\nLoan to joint venture\n-\n2,500\n2,000\nProperty, plant and equipment\n25,431\n19,895\n23,685\nAssets & Liabilities held for sale\n1,178\n171\n394\nWorking capital\n68,278\n63,709\n64,640\nOther provisions and deferred tax\n(22,603)\n(15,476)\n(20,272)\nLease liabilities net of lease receivables\n(53,255)\n(42,103)\n(52,529)\n179,404\n156,910\n170,537\nCash and cash equivalents\n8,496\n4,075\n5,853\nBorrowings\n(83,648)\n(54,139)\n(70,682)\nNet debt\n(75,152)\n(50,064)\n(64,829)\nDeferred consideration\n(2,444)\n(2,399)\n(1,175)\nNet assets\n101,808\n104,447\n104,533\nThe Group's net assets at 31 October 2025 are \u00a3101.8m compared to \u00a3104.5m as at 30 April 2025.\nThe decrease of \u00a32.7m was primarily due to the accrued dividends in the period of \u00a32.6m, together with the reported loss of \u00a30.3m generated in the half year.\nWorking capital\nWorking capital is calculated as follows:\n31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n31 October 2024\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n30 April 2025 (Audited)\u00a3'000\nContract assets\n56,965\n48,857\n50,998\nTrade and other receivables\n42,987\n33,009\n39,552\nCorporation tax receivable\n703\n915\n882\nTotal current assets\n100,655\n82,781\n91,432\nTrade and other payables\n(32,197)\n(18,901)\n(26,662)\nContractual liabilities\n(180)\n(171)\n(130)\nTotal current liabilities\n(32,377)\n(19,072)\n(26,792)\nNet working capital\n68,278\n63,709\n64,640\nNet working capital has increased by \u00a33.7m from \u00a364.6m as at 30 April 2025 to \u00a368.3m as at 31 October 2025. Of this increase \u00a32.0m related to working capital acquired as part of acquisitions during the period. The remaining increase relates mainly to an increase in contract assets (work in progress), net of acquisitions, during the year of \u00a33.7m. Although an increase from the position as at 30 April 2025, this increase at half year is as expected following the normal work in progress cycle with work in progress days at 31 October 2025 having reduced by 2 days from the same time last year. The increase in contract assets is offset by an increase in trade payables of \u00a32.1m due to the timing of creditor payments.\nThe management of working capital continues to be a key focus for the Group with strong systems and controls in place to manage the levels of trade receivables and work in progress. The time taken to convert a unit of time incurred into cash is reported as the lock up4 days for the Group and is an important KPI monitored by the Board, Client Services Directors and the wider management team. As at 31 October 2025 lock up4 was 95 days (31 October 2024: 98 days), made up of debtor days of 32 (31 October 2024: 33) and work in progress days of 63 (31 October 2024: 65) demonstrating continued excellence in financial management.\nDue to the disproportionate amount of time that it takes to conclude certain types of work such as CL medilaw, real estate investment and insolvency matters these work types are excluded from our work in progress days calculation as an exception, so as not to distract the majority of the Group from focussing on achieving its excellent lock up4 days. If work in progress days were calculated including all valued work in progress of the Group this would give work in progress days of 98 (31 October 2024: 111) and hence total lock up, with no exclusions, of 130 days as at 31 October 2025 (31 October 2024: 144 days).\nCash flow\n6 months ended\n31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\u00a3'000\n6 months ended\n31 October 2024 (Unaudited)\u00a3'000\nUnderlying EBITDA\n25,501\n21,417\nChange in working capital\n(5,360)\n(8,388)\nCash outflow for IFRS 16 leases\n(3,466)\n(2,957)\nMovement in underlying share-based payment charge\n735\n445\nCash generated from underlying operations (pre-tax)\n17,410\n10,517\nTax paid\n(2,712)\n(3,617)\nNet cash generated from underlying operating activities\n14,698\n6,900\nUnderlying profit after tax\n12,039\n10,926\nUnderlying cash conversion\n122%\n63%\nCash generation remains a key focus for the Board and management team.

Terms and interest margins remain the same with applicable margins of between 1.65% and 2.55% over SONIA dependant on leverage.\nThe extension of these facilities demonstrates the continued support of

Interim Financial Statements\nFor the 6 month period ended 31 October 2025\n1. General Information\nKnights Group Holdings plc (\"the Company\") is a public company limited by shares and is registered, domiciled and incorporated in England (registration no. 11290101).\nThe Group consists of Knights Group Holdings plc and all of its subsidiaries.\nThe principal activity and nature of operations of the Group is the provision of legal and professional services. The address of its registered office is:\nThe BramptonNewcastle-under-LymeStaffordshireST5 0QW\n2. Accounting policies\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the interim financial information for the six months ended 31 October 2025 are in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK-Adopted International Accounting Standards and are consistent with those which will be adopted in the annual statutory financial statements for the year ending 30 April 2026.\nThe Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2025, prepared under UK-Adopted International Accounting Standards, have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. This interim financial information was approved by the board on 9 January 2026.\nThe financial statements contained in this interim report do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim report has not been audited or reviewed in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.\nMonetary amounts are presented in sterling, being the functional currency of the Group, rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.\n2.2 Going concern\nThe interim financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has a strong trading performance, generates strong operating cashflows and has banking facilities of \u00a3100,000,000, available until November 2028. The Group's forecasts show sufficient cash generation and headroom in banking facilities and covenants by comparison to anticipated future requirements to support the Directors' conclusions that the assumption of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim financial information is appropriate.\nThe Group continues to trade profitably before non-underlying charges and cash generation at an operating cashflow level has remained strong and in line with expectation. In order to satisfy the validity of the going concern assumption, a number of different trading scenarios have been modelled and reviewed. Some of these scenarios forecast a significantly more negative trading performance than is expected. In all of these scenarios the Group remained profitable and with significant headroom in its cash resources for the 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information.\n2.3 Accounting developments\nThere have been no new standards or interpretations relevant to the Group's operations applied in the interim financial information for the first time.\n3.

Free cash flow and cash conversion %\nFree cash flow measures the Group's underlying cash generation. Cash conversion % measures the Group's conversion of its underlying PAT (Profit After Tax) into free cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated as the total of net cash from operating activities after adjusting for tax paid and the impact of IFRS 16. Cash conversion % is calculated by dividing free cash flow by underlying PAT, which is reconciled to profit after tax (note 10).\n6 months ended 31 October 2025\n(Unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\n6 months ended 31 October 2024\n(Unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended\n30 April 2025 (Audited)\n\u00a3'000\nCash generated from operations (note 12)\n20,876\n13,474\n39,011\nTax paid\n(2,712)\n(3,617)\n(5,820)\nNet underlying cash outflow for IFRS 16 leases\n(3,466)\n(2,957)\n(6,515)\nFree cash flow\n14,698\n6,900\n26,676\nUnderlying profit after tax (note 10)\n12,039\n10,926\n20,555\nCash conversion (%)\n122%\n63%\n130%\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
