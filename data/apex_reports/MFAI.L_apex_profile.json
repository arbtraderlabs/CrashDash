Furthermore, a profit of \u20ac1.05 million, equivalent to a 4.3x return in \u20ac terms, was generated on the Company's indirect cost of investment in Getvisibility made via SVV1.\n\u00b7\nThe cash balance at the end of the period amounted to \u00a31,470,000 (31 December 2024: \u00a3220,000), after the repayment of the\noutstanding balance of the series of two\u2010year loan notes in April\n2025, leaving the Company debt free.\n\u00b7\nA number of new investments have been made in\nH1\n2025 through\nSVV2 into companies such as Inephany, Capably and Literal Labs, and in Mirror Security and\nMomntum\nAI through SVV3.\n\u00b7\nA direct investment has also been made in an AIM quoted company, Catenai plc, in order to obtain exposure to its principal investment, Alludium, which is\na software company that is developing a Multi-Agent AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) platform for AI automation of processes and solutions for productivity.\nPost period end\n\u00b7\nThe Company made a direct investment in CameraMatics in order to help fund future expansion. CameraMatics, in which the Company already has exposure through its investment in SVV1, has recently secured a number of significant new contracts.\n\u00b7\nSVV2 made a new investment in Innex.ai, a company\nthat helps NHS Estates and infrastructure teams to search, write and review documents more quickly.\n\u00b7\nSVV3 has made a new investment\nin Kerno Investment, which is an AI platform that helps software teams detect and fix issues more quickly.\nNicholas Lee, Director of Mindflair, commented:\n\"The Company has continued to make excellent progress in the first half of 2025 with a significant investment realisation through the disposal of Getvisibility. This marks the fourth realisation from SVV1 and provides the Company with a strengthened cash position to support its investment strategy.\n\"SVV2 and SVV3 have continued to make a number of new investments in exciting high growth AI companies, and Mindflair continues to provide investors with an excellent opportunity to gain exposure to a portfolio of AI focused companies curated by a team of experts in a sector which continues to be at the forefront of technology development. The AI sector continues to represent an attractive area for investment with significant global funds being deployed in this area.

The round was led by\nAmadeus Capital Partners\n, with participation from\nSVV\nand\nProfessor Steve Young\n, an AI pioneer and serial entrepreneur, who joins Inephany as both an angel investor and Chairman.\nAs generative AI continues to develop, the computing and energy costs of training cutting-edge models have emerged as a major bottleneck. Inephany addresses this challenge with a novel AI-driven optimisation system that intelligently controls the training process in real-time. Compared to traditional approaches that rely on exhaustive trial-and-error optimisations, Inephany's technology improves sample efficiency, accelerates training, reduces overall development time, and enhances final model performance - all while reducing computing costs. This development has the potential to unlock scalable, sustainable AI development that is significantly more cost-effective.\nWhile the company's initial focus is on training-time optimisation for LLMs, its technology has broad applicability across the AI landscape - from Recurrent Neural Networks used in financial time-series forecasting, to Convolutional Neural Networks powering computer vision in autonomous systems. The company also has plans to expand its AI-powered optimisation approach to inference time compute. By reducing the cost of training and deploying these models, the Inephany team aims to democratise access to advanced AI and accelerate innovation across industries.\nNicholas Lee, Director of Mindflair plc, commented\n:\n\"Generative AI is at the forefront the AI landscape and it is very exciting to have a company like Inephany joining the Company's exciting AI focused investment portfolio.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.

Getvisibility is a cybersecurity company focusing on data visibility and control and uses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (\"AI\") to classify and secure unstructured information. The Disposal is expected to generate a gross cash inflow to the Company of approximately \u20ac2.1 million (\u00a31.8 million).\nIn addition, Mindflair has an indirect interest in Getvisibility through its investment in the first Sure Valley Ventures (\"SVV\") fund (\"SVV1\") and through its shareholding in Sure Ventures plc (\"SV plc\") which in turn has a 25.9% interest in SVV1.\nSVV has indicated that Mindflair can expect to receive approximately \u20ac0.9 million (\u00a30.8 million) as a result of the distribution from SVV1 of the proceeds from the sale of SVV1's shareholding in Getvisibility. Mindflair also has a 23.6% shareholding in SV plc and so may also receive a distribution from the proceeds that they receive from the disposal of Getvisibility.\nIn summary therefore, Mindflair expects to receive, in aggregate, approximately \u00a32.6 million in cash from the sale of Getvisibility through the Disposal and sale of its indirect interest held through its investment in SVV1. It may also receive additional funds from any distribution made by SV plc.\nThe Disposal would represent a return of 6.0x the total investment made into this company directly and a circa 4.5x multiple on the total investment made by SVV1. As at 31 December 2024, the carrying value of the Company's direct investment in Getvisibility was \u00a31.2 million on an unaudited basis. The completion of the Disposal is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions that are customary for a transaction of this type. The Company will use part of the cash inflow from the Disposal to settle the remaining outstanding loan notes amounting to circa \u00a3800,000, and the accrued interest thereon. A further announcement will be made in due course upon receipt of the proceeds from the Disposal.\nNicholas Lee, a Director of Mindflair, said:\n\"This is an excellent result for Mindflair and its shareholders, particularly as the Company has multiple interests in Getvisibility both directly and via its investments in two other entities. This is a clear example of the quality of the companies within Mindflair's investment portfolio and further validation of the Company's investment strategy. This is the fifth exit event from SVV1 since inception and, as previously announced, clearly demonstrates that this fund is very much in the exit phase of its investment cycle. We look forward to providing further portfolio updates in due course.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and\u00a0the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.

Mindflair holds a 13% direct interest in SVV1 and a 23.6% interest Sure Ventures plc, who in turn has a 25.9% holding in SVV1.\nAs at 30 June 2024, the date of the Company's interim results for the six months to 30 June 2024, the value of the Company's investment in SVV1 amounted to \u00a35,445,702. This is based on SVV1's NAV calculation as provided to its investors. As at 31 December 2024, this figure had increased by \u00a31,907,675 (or 35%) to \u00a37,353,377.\nAs at 30 June 2024, the value of the Company's investment in SV plc amounted to \u00a31,088,225. This was based on the SV plc share price of 72.5 pence as at that date. SV plc's NAV at 31 December 2024 amounted to 148 pence per SV plc share. As at 31 December 2024, the value of Mindflair's investment in SV plc, which includes an additional investment of \u00a3300,000 made in August 2024, was \u00a31,489,768, based on the SV plc share price of 82 pence as at that date. SV plc's NAV at 31 December 2024 amounted to 181 pence per SV plc share. Since 31 December 2024, SV plc's share price has increased to 97.5 pence as of 29 January 2025.\nThis increase in value of both investments has principally been driven by the impact of the increasing valuation of Infinite Reality (\"iR\") which forms part of the SVV1 portfolio as a result of SVV1's sale of its holding in Landvault to iR as announced in July 2024.\nNicholas Lee, a Director of Mindflair, said:\n\"It is very encouraging to see how two material investments within the Company's portfolio have significantly increased in value over the last six months.

Furthermore, whilst not being a requirement, the Company has specifically made the Scheme subject to shareholder approval which is consistent with the Company's ethos of working closely with and in the interest of its shareholders.\nThe Scheme\nThe Company has conditionally granted 41,500,000 options, in aggregate, with an exercise price equal to nominal value of the Company's ordinary shares, over new ordinary shares in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\"), which would represent 7.8% of the Company's current issued share capital, subject to the Scheme being approved by shareholders at the Company's next general meeting.

These options vest in three equal tranches subject to time-based milestones:\n\u00b7\none third of the options granted shall vest following shareholder approval (\"First Tranche\");\n\u00b7\none third of the options granted shall vest on 22 January 2026; and\n\u00b7\none third of the options granted shall vest on 22 January 2027.\nThe current grant of options under the Scheme amounts to 7.8% of the Company's current issued share capital, although the Scheme will permit the issuance of up to 15 % of the Company's issued share capital under option in the future, as enlarged from time to time, if required.\nA further announcement in relation to a circular being posted to convene a general meeting will be made in due course.\nNicholas Lee, Director, said:\n\"The Scheme is an effective way of both compensating the directors and employees for the significant reduction in cash compensation in order to conserve cash for the Company whilst, at the same time, aligning their compensation with shareholders' interests such that a significant element of the return from this arrangement only crystallises once the Company's share price has increased substantially from current levels.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.

It also highlighted how quickly AI has advanced, in such a short space of time. A small number of companies at the frontier of AI are set to have a disproportionate amount of global influence. The statement went on to say that the UK has a window of opportunity to secure and strengthen the Countries global leadership in AI. This will help protect economic security and help us be a part of the exponential growth of global AI.\nThe government is committed to building a cutting-edge, secure, and sustainable AI infrastructure. It wants to take forward the recommendations to expand its sovereign compute capacity. Computing needs could grow by at least 20x by 2030. This expansion is critical if the UK is to keep pace.\nTo seize this opportunity, the government will launch a new function with the mandate to strengthen the UK's sovereign AI capabilities by supporting national champions at the frontier of AI. The function will operate with agility and draw on wider government functions to partner with AI companies. Methods will include-:\n\u00b7\nLeveraging AI Growth Zones to support partnered companies and ensuring that new compute capacity is utilised strategically.\n\u00b7\nExploring making available high-potential data sets for partnered companies, in coordination with the National Data Library.\n\u00b7\nSupporting top AI talent to relocate to the UK to work with UK-based partnered companies.\n\u00b7\nHelping to build relationships between partnered AI companies and the UK's national security community.\nAs the Action Plan sets out, the UK must maximise opportunities to crowd in private sector investment and facilitate close government-industry collaboration. The government will create AI Growth Zones (AIGZs), areas with enhanced access to power and support for planning approvals, to accelerate the build out of AI infrastructure on UK soil.\nWe believe that our Investment in the Sure Valley Ventures Enterprise Fund (ECF), founded by Barry Downes and Brian Kinane, which is a British Business Bank backed fund, sits right in the \"sweet spot\" of the Governments plan and we would like to highlight several portfolio companies that can assist the adoption and transformation of the UK's technological AI infrastructure:\nStylus (Learncycle Ltd)\nStylus delivers an AI-powered marking solution aimed at reducing teacher workload and addressing the recruitment and retention crisis in education. By automating the marking of paper-based assessments, Stylus significantly cuts down the time teachers spend on grading. The platform provides detailed, personalized feedback for students, enhancing their learning experience. Teachers can easily scan completed assessments, which are then processed by Stylus's AI to provide immediate feedback and follow-up questions, streamlining the evaluation process and helping to alleviate teacher burnout. This will provide much needed assistance and efficiency in a major UK Government spending area.\nPurple Transform Limited\nPurple Transform provides a cutting-edge SaaS platform, SiYtE\u2122, designed to address data overload and enhance safety and security in large infrastructures like rail networks. By leveraging advanced AI and machine vision, the platform transforms existing cameras into smart sensors, delivering real-time alerts and predictive analytics. It seamlessly integrates with current IoT",

Placees will also receive one warrant for every two shares issued as part of the Placing (the \"Placing Warrants\"), on the same terms as the Repriced Warrants (as defined below), subject to the approval of an increase in share issue headroom which will be sought at the Company's next general meeting.\nThe Placing Price represents\na\n1\n1.1\n%\ndiscount to the closing mid-market price\nof\n0.\n6\n7\n5\npence on\n2\n3\nDecember\n2024\n.\nLoan Note Re-profile\nOn 22 December 2022, the Company issued Loan Notes amounting to \u00a31,235,000, in aggregate. The Company has now agreed with the holders of the Loan Notes to re-profile the Loan Notes which were due for repayment in December 2024 (\"Re-profile\"). The principal elements of this re-profile comprise:\n- a payment to redeem \u00a3185,250 of Loan Notes to reduce part of the principal owed\n- the issue of 78,238,798 new shares in the Company at a price of 0.6 pence to the Loan Note holders to redeem part of the principal owed and settle accrued interest and costs to date (the \"Loan Note Shares\"). In aggregate, \u00a3\n469,433\nwill be redeemed from the Loan Notes through the issuance of Loan Note Shares\n- the exercise price of the warrants issued as part of the original issue of the Loan Notes in December 2022 (the \"Repriced Warrants\") has been reduced to 1.6 pence (from 4 pence), the vesting hurdle for the Repriced Warrants has been reduced to 2.5 pence (from 5.16 pence) and the exercise period of the Repriced Warrants has been extended to 31 December 2026\n- 50% of the remaining balance due on the Loan Notes plus future accrued interest is to be repaid by 31 December 2025 and 50% of the remaining balance plus future accrued interest is to be repaid by 31 December 2026.\nThe Re-profile will reduce the amount due under the Loan Notes to circa \u00a3800,000.\nBackground to the Placing and Re-profile of the Loan Notes\nWhilst the Company expects certain of its investments to be sold in the short to medium term which would be expected to generate sufficient proceeds to repay the Loan Notes, the precise timing of this may vary and therefore the combination of a placing now, along with the re-profile of the Loan Notes will provide the Company with additional flexibility and enable it to preserve additional cash for investment purposes.\nPortfolio update\nAs previously announced, the first Sure Valley Ventures (\"SVV\") fund, SVV1, is in the realisation phase of its investment cycle. Activity in this regard has increased significantly in recent months with certain companies in this fund actively pursuing either sales or exploring\nalternative forms of liquidity for their shareholders\n. Such activity includes the hiring of advisers to manage sale processes, the holding of discussions with potential buyers and the possible provision of other forms of liquidity. We expect to be able to provide a further update on how these activities are progressing in due course.\nIn addition, SVV2, the second SVV fund, corner-stoned by the British Business Bank, is continuing to actively invest in AI focused businesses.\nThis portfolio now comprises eight exciting AI-driven companies that are all making good progress in developing their operations. These businesses span a number of sectors including education, e-commerce, transport, and robotics\n.\nAdditionally, the SVV team is increasingly recognised as a thought leader\nin the AI sector and has recently published a paper on AI Predictions for 2025. In addition, SVV has partnered with Imperial College in London to help AI researchers commercialise their research and with NVIDIA to present an AI masterclass for researchers and venture capitalists.\nRelated Party Transaction\nFollowing the issue of the Loan Notes on 22 December 2022, a Loan Note holder disposed of their Loan Note to\nRiverfort Global Opportunities PLC (\"RGO\") which has an existing interest over 38,228,393 ordinary shares in the Company, representing 10.4% of the Company's issued share capital and, as such, is a substantial shareholder as defined in the AIM Rules for Companies (\"AIM Rules\"). Nicholas Lee, a director of the Company, is also the Investment Director of RGO. Accordingly, the Re-profile of the Loan Note held by RGO is a related party tr",
