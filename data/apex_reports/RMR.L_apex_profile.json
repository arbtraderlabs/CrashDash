This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post maiden MRE drilling programme, with drilling at Kalayi continuing to demonstrate that near-surface high-grade tin mineralisation continues at depth.\nFour new drillholes have completed (five in total at Kalayi), with a further hole approaching its target depth. Initial on-site portable handheld XRF readings summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillholes KBDD020 to KBDD023 with average grades of mineralisation and depths tested:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD023 encountered\n2m @ 8.30% tin\nfrom 74 metres depth and\n5m @ 0.48% tin\nfrom 86 metres.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD021 encountered\n2m @ 2.23% tin\nfrom 181 metres depth and\n2m @ 2.33% copper\nfrom 107 metres.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD022 encountered 1m @ 1.89% tin at 54 metres depth, 1m @ 1.35% tin at 68 metres depth and 1m @ 0.34% tin at 72m.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD020 was abandoned at 40.5 metres and redrilled to a depth of 135.0 metres, without encountering significant tin mineralisation.\nFigure 1:\nDrill core showing visible cassiterite (brown) within a broader ~2.0 m mineralised interval, with portable handheld XRF readings indicating an average grade of ~8.3% Sn.\nThe handheld XRF used at Bisie North is a Thermo Scientific NitonTM XL3t model. Readings represent averages of 60 second continuous analysis along 1m sections of core. The X-ray beam is emitted through an 8mm window and penetrates up to several millimetres into the drill core. The metal grades determined by the portable handheld XRF are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for resource estimation. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay, with results to be reported in due course.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\nUp to four further drill holes (including the current hole) are planned on Kalayi to continue testing the down-plunge extent of tin mineralisation, after which drilling will resume at Mont Agoma where the Company is targeting deeper tin-rich zones beneath the established polymetallic system.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We continue to be encouraged by this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is considered consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation. These results further support our view that Kalayi hosts high-grade tin shoots that persist below the depths tested to date.\nDrilling will move to Mont Agoma in the coming weeks. We look forward to regularly updating the market as drilling continues on both prospects and further results become available.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/rAk8wy\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDr. Paul Armitage is a consultant of Rome Resources plc, a qualified geologist, a Fellow of the London Geological Society and a Member of the\nInstitute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\n.

This update follows the drilling update provided on 16 January 2026.\nMetallurgical testing was undertaken by SGS on bulk samples from the tin, copper and zinc zones in order to assess the potential for commercial recovery of the various commodity metals from the ore. The results for copper and tin recovery are encouraging.\n\u00b7\nThe tin zone sample has responded well to gravity pre-concentration with 80% of the Sn reporting to a first concentrate at a grade of over 10% Sn from a head grade of 0.6% Sn in less than 5% of the mass.\n\u00b7\nThe copper zone sample has also responded well to gravity pre-concentration with 96% of the Cu reporting to a concentrate at a grade of 3.7% Cu from a head grade of 2.4% Cu in less than 63% of the mass.\n\u00b7\nThe copper sample responded very well to flotation with 95.5% of the Cu reporting to the rougher flotation at a grade of 9.5% Cu. The Zn in this sample followed the Cu and differential flotation may therefore be considered to separate the Cu and Zn.\nIn all cases customary cleaning of the tin and copper concentrates will be required in order to raise the grade to export levels.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, said:\n\"These preliminary results are highly encouraging for the potential commercialisation of both the tin and copper at Bisie North. As the copper is developed at shallow depths in the Mont Agoma deposit, recovery and monetisation of this is expected to be highly accretive to the overall project economics.\nCurrently, the drilling campaign at Kalayi continues and we will move to Mont Agoma next month to test further the extent of the tin and copper mineralisation.

This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post-maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") drilling programme, details of which were announced on 23 December 2025. The maiden MRE confirmed that the target zones are part of a large polymetallic system, with Mont Agoma demonstrating a wide zone dominated by near-surface copper with tin grade anticipated to increase at depth, and Kalayi showing near-surface high-grade tin, open at depth and expected to increase in width and grade with depth.\nTwo holes have been completed, and a third hole is approaching its target depth. Initial findings are summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillhole KBD019:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD019 was drilled to a total depth of 189.5 metres, having encountered significant tin mineralisation between 129 metres and 135 metres.\n\u00b7\nHandheld XRF readings at 1-metre intervals across this\n6-metre-wide zone average 1.6% tin\n(six readings ranging 0.02% to 3.94% including four readings above 1.4%)\n.\n\u00b7\nThis interval is within a\nbroader 26-metre-wide zone\nshowing disseminated cassiterite between 114.0 metres and 140.7 metres depth, supporting the continuity of mineralisation at Kalayi.\n\u00b7\nThe drilling rig has since moved with drilling commenced at hole KBD020.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD034 was drilled to 94 metres, serving as a control point for the structural model.\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD035, drilled from the same pad location, is currently at approximately 190 metres depth and progressing within the main Mont Agoma mineralised zone.\nSampling and Assays\nThe reported tin grades are derived from handheld XRF analyses. These are spot readings with an approximately 10-millimetre-wide analytical window and are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for any resource calculations. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay in due course, with results to be reported once received.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We are encouraged by the early indications from this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation.\n\"Drilling at Mont Agoma is also progressing well as we move toward the deeper parts of the system where we believe tin grades may strengthen.

This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post-maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") drilling programme, details of which were announced on 23 December 2025. The maiden MRE confirmed that the target zones are part of a large polymetallic system, with Mont Agoma demonstrating a wide zone dominated by near-surface copper with tin grade anticipated to increase at depth, and Kalayi showing near-surface high-grade tin, open at depth and expected to increase in width and grade with depth.\nTwo holes have been completed, and a third hole is approaching its target depth. Initial findings are summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillhole KBD019:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD019 was drilled to a total depth of 189.5 metres, having encountered significant tin mineralisation between 129 metres and 135 metres.\n\u00b7\nHandheld XRF readings at 1-metre intervals across this\n6-metre-wide zone average 1.6% tin\n(six readings ranging 0.02% to 3.94% including four readings above 1.4%)\n.\n\u00b7\nThis interval is within a\nbroader 26-metre-wide zone\nshowing disseminated cassiterite between 114.0 metres and 140.7 metres depth, supporting the continuity of mineralisation at Kalayi.\n\u00b7\nThe drilling rig has since moved with drilling commenced at hole KBD020.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD034 was drilled to 94 metres, serving as a control point for the structural model.\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD035, drilled from the same pad location, is currently at approximately 190 metres depth and progressing within the main Mont Agoma mineralised zone.\nSampling and Assays\nThe reported tin grades are derived from handheld XRF analyses. These are spot readings with an approximately 10-millimetre-wide analytical window and are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for any resource calculations. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay in due course, with results to be reported once received.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We are encouraged by the early indications from this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation.\n\"Drilling at Mont Agoma is also progressing well as we move toward the deeper parts of the system where we believe tin grades may strengthen. We look forward to regularly updating the market as drilling continues on both prospects and further results become available.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/rAk8wy\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDr. Paul Armitage is a consultant of Rome Resources plc, a qualified geologist, a Fellow of the London Geological Society and a Member of the\nInstitute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\n.

This campaign is aimed at testing deeper mineralisation beneath areas defined by the announced maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\"). The helicopter, drilling crew and required equipment is now on-site, with initial drilling underway at the Mont Agoma prospect using two drill rigs. This is expected to be followed by the drill rigs moving the short distance to the Kalayi prospect.\nKey elements of the forward drilling campaign include:\n\u00b7\nTargeting a number of key exploration targets, with an aggregate in-house estimate of between 53 and 144 kt of potential contained tin across both prospects.\n\u00b7\nAt Mont Agoma, drilling will target two main areas:\no\nExtending the strike of the Mont Agoma East zone; and\no\nTesting grades in the deeper Mont Agoma Western zone, where strong copper grades are anticipated to give way to higher tin grades at depth.\n\u00b7\nAt Kalayi, drilling will target extensions beneath existing high grade tin intercepts with the expectation, consistent with Alphamin's Bisie Mpama Mine results, that the thinner high-grade intercepts may widen at depth while retaining a high grade.\n\u00b7\nA total of approximately 2,000 metres of drilling is planned across 6 to 8 holes, with the programme anticipated to complete towards the end of the first quarter of 2026.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the receipt of core assays, the Company intends to update the MRE to incorporate additional intercepts from this drilling campaign.\nExploratory discussions continue with a number of parties active in the region to assess potential strategic pathways for value creation following the proposed publication of an updated MRE.\n2025 Operational Review\nFollowing the Company's admission to trading on AIM in July 2024 and the strategic investment by Stanvic Mining, Rome Resources completed a diamond drilling campaign across the Bisie North Project. A total of 5,143 metres of drill core were recovered from the Kalayi and Mont Agoma Prospects in that campaign.\nThis campaign focused on defining tin mineralisation at Kalayi and understanding the structure within the approximately 200-metre-wide polymetallic system at Mont Agoma. Resulting tin, copper, zinc and silver assays were incorporated into the Company's geological model and the maiden MRE, prepared by The MSA Group (Pty) Ltd.\nThe maiden MRE, derived from\u00a0shallow drilling over a limited portion of the licence area, delivered the following tonnages, and provides a robust foundation for testing significantly greater potential at depth:\nMont Agoma\n3.16Mt\nat 1.45% Cu, 0.16% Sn, 2.72% Zn and 14.3 g/t Ag\nKalayi\n0.33Mt\nat 1.36% Sn\nDrilling to date has generally extended to only\u00a0~220-250 metres depth\u00a0and across a relatively small fraction of the prospective licence area, leaving substantial scope for further discovery both at depth and along strike.\nA new near-surface tin zone, Mont Agoma East, intersected in one of the final holes of the 2025 campaign, was not included in the maiden MRE as it formed a single data point but now represents a promising and priority target within the current drilling campaign.\nDuring the year, metallurgical work was also commissioned to assess processing routes to economically recover the significant copper resource sitting above the tin zones at Mont Agoma. Phase one of this work is nearing completion, with results expected in due course.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, said:\n\"2025 has been a very active year, culminating in the publication of our first Mineral Resource Estimate, which confirmed Bisie North as a large, multi-metallic system. Importantly, the maiden MRE highlights how little of the system has been tested to date and where the key opportunities lie as we move deeper.\nWe are now embarking on the next phase of drilling at Mont Agoma and Kalayi with a focus on testing deeper intercepts where we believe there is potential for higher tin grades to emerge, consistent with regional analogues.\nWe were deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Mark Gasson last month. However, he would have been pleased to know that our dedicated and experienced in-country team has ensured continuity of operations.\nShareholder value growth remains the core objective of the business and our approach to this is to maximise the share ",

This marks the start of the next phase of exploration following the Company's maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") released on 30 October 2025.\nThe MRE confirmed Bisie North as a\u00a0large, multi-metallic system, with significant tin, copper, zinc and silver mineralisation defined at Kalayi and Mont Agoma. Importantly, drilling to date has only tested a small portion of the licence area and only to shallow depths of approximately 220 - 250 metres. Internal geological modelling by Rome Resources indicates exploration targets across the two deposits of\u00a0between 102,000 and 260,000 aggregate tonnes of contained tin, highlighting the scale of potential growth as the system is drilled deeper and along strike.\nAs such, the next phase of exploration is designed to begin testing that deeper potential by targeting:\n\u00b7\nDeeper tin zones beneath the main Mont Agoma polymetallic system, where modelling indicates tin grades are likely to strengthen with depth as copper declines, consistent with regional analogues such as Alphamin's Bisie mine;\n\u00b7\nThe Mont Agoma East tin zone, where a near-surface 23 metres tin intercept was identified post-MRE and will now be drilled out ahead of inclusion in a follow-up resource estimate; and\n\u00b7\nHigh-grade tin shoots at Kalayi, where shallow historic intercepts suggest thicker, higher-grade zones may exist at depth, mirroring patterns seen at the neighbouring Bisie mine.\nThe BAC contract helicopter returned to the DRC over the weekend and is now preparing for phased mobilisation of the crews and equipment to the project site over the coming days. Drilling will commence first on Mont Agoma, where the three rigs are currently positioned, before moving to Kalayi once the initial sequence of drill holes is completed.\nA further update will be provided as drilling commences, followed by regular updates as results start to flow.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to restart operations so soon after delivering the maiden MRE, which confirmed Bisie North as a significant, multi-metallic system with exceptional growth potential. This new drilling phase is designed to test exactly where the system is expected to become highest grade specifically at depth beneath Mont Agoma, within the newly identified Mont Agoma East zone, and below the known high-grade shoots at Kalayi.\nThis is a strategically important programme for Rome Resources, focused on the deeper source of the tin. With mobilisation underway, we look forward to advancing drilling rapidly and updating the market as results come through.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/s/5b5af1\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These remain subject to the execution of legally binding agreements, and there can be no certainty that final binding terms will be agreed or as to timing. Further updates will be provided as discussions progress.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"This maiden resource estimate marks a major milestone for Rome Resources and a significant validation of the scale and multi-metallic potential of the Bisie North Project. The results suggest that we are only beginning to define a very substantial tin and copper system, with mineralisation remaining open at depth and along strike.\nBased on internal modelling, Rome Resources has defined a low-to-high case\u00a0exploration target of between 102,000 and 260,000 tonnes of contained tin, underscoring the considerable potential beyond the current resource envelope. The neighbouring\u00a0Alphamin Bisie mine, along the same geological trend, has demonstrated that tin grades and widths increase significantly with depth, and we believe Mont Agoma may follow a similar pattern.\nThe MRE provides a strong foundation for the next phase of work, which will include deeper drilling in the main Mont Agoma zone, drilling out the high-grade\u00a0Mont Agoma East zone\u00a0ahead of a follow-up MRE, and continued testing of additional targets across the licence area.\nWith Bisie North now defined as a large, multi-commodity system, we are well positioned to engage with strategic partners and to build on this momentum through the next phase of exploration and resource growth.\"\nThe exploration targets identified as part of the next phase of work are preliminary in nature and based on internal estimates derived from geological modelling. In this regard, there has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain whether further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource.\nMineral Resource Estimate MRE\nF",

Highlights in this campaign have been tin intercepts of up 12.5 metres at 1.06 per cent. tin combined with exceptional copper grades of up to 20 per cent. copper in Mont Agoma. Follow-up drilling in early 2025 was enabled as a result of the strategic investment by Stanvic Mining SARL and as of the reporting date of\n30 June 2025\n, the Company was in the final stages of this drilling campaign, which subsequently completed in August 2025.\nOperations\nUp to four helicopter-portable drill rigs have been operating on-site since August 2024. Drilling operations were undertaken at both the Kalayi and Mont Agoma prospects. With the exception of a brief period in the second quarter of 2025, when the security situation necessitated the need to temporarily shutdown operations both for us and the neighbouring Alphamin Resources mine facility, drilling has continued, supported by BAC Helicopters. Sample preparation was undertaken on-site and samples dispatched to ALS Johannesburg for analysis.\nIn addition, further geochemical soil sampling was undertaken to identify future exploration targets stepping out from both Kalayi and Mont Agoma.\nOutlook\nThe results of the Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate, due by mid-October, will create the platform for the next phase of exploration and delineation. It is anticipated that, in the coming 6 months, that drilling will be undertaken on a number of targets:\n\u00b7\nKalayi\n- deeper tin intercepts and stepout drilling to the north and south of Kalayi along with an extension to the tin-in-soil anomaly; and\n\u00b7\nMont Agoma\n- southeast plunge of Mont Agoma East tin zone, deeper intercepts in the main zone and offset drilling on tin and copper soil anomalies to the north of the current limit of drilling.\nManagement intends to keep up the momentum of exploration through to 2026 and develop the project into a compelling tin and copper play for the coming decades.\nPaul Barrett\nChief Executive Officer & Director\n30 September 2025\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor\nth\ne 6 Months\nE\nnd\ned 30 June 2025\nNote\n6 months to30 June 2025 (unaudited)\n6 months to30 June 2024 (unaudited)\n15 months to31 December 2024 (audited)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCONTINU\nI\nN\nG O\nP\nE\nR\nA\nT\nI\nONS\nR\ne\nv\ne\nnu\ne\n-\n-\n-\n",

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 September 2025\nRome Resources plc\n(\"\nRome\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nHigh-value Tin, Copper and Zinc identified ahead of maiden MRE\nRome Resources plc announces the latest assay results received from recent drilling at its\u00a0Mont Agoma prospect, part of the Company's flagship\u00a0Bisie North Project\u00a0in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The drilling campaign has identified wide, high-value\u00a0tin zones\u00a0together with significant\u00a0copper and zinc mineralisation. These results are expected to provide the final inputs to the Company's\u00a0maiden mineral resource estimate (\"MRE\"), which is in the process of being finalised by the MSA Group and which remains targeted for publication by the end of September 2025.\nAssays have been received for Mont Agoma drillholes MADD022, MADD025, MADD027 and MADD028, in the western mineralized zone and drillhole MADD030A in the newly identified eastern tin zone (Mont Agoma East), where a\n23 metre wide tin zone has been identified from assayed core samples\n.\nWithin\nMADD030A\nat Mont Agoma East, the 23-metre assayed tin zone sits in a larger 40-metre-wide tin mineralised zone, core recovery being lower in the near-surface gossan material.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nSignificant tin intercepts in these drillholes include:\no\nMADD030A:\n23.1m at 0.42% Sn\nfrom 3m, including\n0.45m at 1.56%\nfrom 8.6m\n,\n12.2m at 0.75% Sn\nfrom 12.3m\n, including\n, 1.6m at 1.42%\nfrom 13.5m\nand 5.0m at 0.92% Sn\nfrom 19.5m including\n1m at 1.67%\nfrom 22m\no\nMADD022: 5.7m at 0.56% Sn from 19m, including\n0.5m at 3.12% Sn\no\nMADD027:\n19.0m at 0.38% Sn\nfrom 72m, including\n0.40m at 1.10% Sn\no\nMADD028: 1.0m at 1.74% Sn from 109m, including\n0.50m at 2.88% Sn\no\nMADD028: 13.0m at 0.24% Sn from surface, including\n0.50m at 1.40% Sn\n\u00b7\nThe intersection in MADD030A lies within a broader tin zone of\n35m at 0.35% Sn\nfrom 3m making the eastern zone a significant drilling target with a potential strike of more than 500 metres.\n\u00b7\nTin is currently trading at c. US$34,000 per tonne, underscoring the high value of these results.\n\u00b7\nAdditionally, exceptional zinc and strong copper intercepts have been recorded, the highlights being:\no\nMADD025:\n56m at 4.86% Zn\nfrom 136m, including\n42.0m at 5.90% Zn\no\nMADD025:\n2.8m at 20.04% Zn\nfrom 131m and\n9.5m at 3.3% Zn\nfrom 104m, including\n0.8m at 30.00% Zn\no\nMADD027:\n2.9m at 2.11% Cu\nfrom 67m, including\n0.9m at 4.65% Cu\no\nMADD028:\n0.5m at 28.40% Zn\nfrom 130m and\n11m at 11.05% Zn\nfrom 132m\no\nMADD030A:\n4.25m at 2.65% Cu\nfrom 71m, including\n2.25m at 4.13%\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"These latest assay results underscore the high-value potential of Mont Agoma. The tin grades we are seeing are excellent, particularly with tin trading at around US$34,000 per tonne, while wide intercepts of high-grade zinc mineralisation provide valuable additional economic upside. Importantly, the confirmation of Mont Agoma East gives us a new growth prospect that is expected to be incorporated into a follow-up resource estimate after the maiden MRE, targeted to be announced by the end of this month.\nOur immediate focus is to finalise the maiden MRE with MSA for both Mont Agoma and Kalayi. This is expected to set the foundation for the next phase of the project - drilling out the new eastern tin zone, undertaking deeper drilling in the main Mont Agoma zone, and stepout drilling at the Kalayi tin project.\nThe 23 metre tin intercept in hole MADD030A creates a compelling target for further drilling down-plunge to the southeast. We look forward to delivering the maiden resource estimate and moving quickly into the next phase of resource drilling to capture this upside potential.\"\nExploration Update\nThe Company also announces the formal naming of\u00a0Mont Agoma East, a newly defined prospect where hole MADD030A (re-drill of abandoned hole MADD030) reported a\n23m-wide tin zone from surface\n. Together with results from the western Mont Agoma zone, these assays indicate the system's scale and reinforces the structural model of fault repetition, which has displaced deeper mineralisation upwards into Mont Agoma East.\nThe tin results are particularly significant; while the main zone remains high in the system the grades are strengthening with depth. Drill hole MADD030A demonstrated intervals in excess of 2% Sn (measured by the XRF analyser), pointing to the potential for higher-grade shoots at depth, consistent with other granite-hosted tin-copper systems worldwide.\nThe significant zinc mineralisation intersected in drill hole MADD025 provides further encouragement, representing a potential economic by-product and a low-risk overburden as the tin zones are targete",

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n12 August 2025\nRome Resources plc\n(\"\nRome\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nEncouraging Drilling Results and Ongoing Resource Work at Mont Agoma\nRome Resources plc provides an update on the ongoing exploration activities at its\u00a0Mont Agoma prospect, part of the Company's flagship\u00a0Bisie North Project\u00a0in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (the \"DRC\").\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRecent drilling has encountered tin and copper mineralisation at both newly identified zones in addition to deeper extensions of known zones.\n\u00b7\nThe new tin zone, encountered at drill hole MADD030, was confirmed by drill hole MADD030A which returned 18 metres of mineralisation with a maximum grade of 2.4% tin measured by the XRF analyser.\n\u00b7\nResults suggest the presence of a strike-slip fault creating a potential duplication of the principal mineralisation zone to the east of the main zone drilled to date.\n\u00b7\nDrill hole MADD032 encountered a copper intercept measuring 13 metres, with the XRF analyser reporting a maximum grade of 13% copper plus 9 metres of tin within a higher-grade, 13 metres wide zinc zone - interpreted as the continuation of the main zone of mineralisation at depth.\n\u00b7\nThe significant copper intercepts are expected to add to the growing polymetallic resource at Mont Agoma in connection with the ongoing work associated with the Company's maiden mineral resource estimate (\"MRE\").\n\u00b7\nAssays for a six further drill hole samples are expected in 2 to 3 weeks and will be included in the forthcoming MRE.\n\u00b7\nSoil sampling to define a northerly extension of the tin anomaly along strike from the main tin zone intercepts is complete, with results also expected in 2 to 3 weeks.\n\u00b7\nMetallurgical testwork, aiming to quantify the mineralogy and evaluate optimum beneficiation processes for optimum multi-commodity revenue streams at Mont Agoma, is underway at SGS Ontario.\nIn addition to these results, the forward programme is to include stepout drilling along strike to the new tin zone and deeper drilling of the main zone at Mont Agoma as well as lower-risk deeper drilling of the tin zone at Kalayi, following the soil survey and MRE.\nGiven the multi-commodity nature of Mont Agoma, (principally tin, copper, zinc, and silver) metallurgical testing is underway aiming to determine the optimum processing route and maximise recoveries. Three composite samples are undergoing a two-phase programme of head assays and mineralogical characterisation, followed by beneficiation testing to assess multi-commodity recoveries. Results will feed directly into the project's economic assessment.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We are pleased to see consistent mineralisation coming through in our follow-up drilling at Mont Agoma. Drill holes MADD030 and MADD030A suggest additional tin potential to the east of Mont Agoma and the copper grades emerging from MADD032 are equally encouraging.\nWe are working closely with MSA to ensure our geological model and upcoming MRE are both technically robust and representative of the system's potential.\nWith several assays pending and both MRE and metallurgical testwork underway, the coming months should provide the potential for multiple value-driving milestones for the Company.\"\nDrilling Overview\nThe current phase of drilling at Mont Agoma was focused on expanding previously defined mineralisation down to deeper levels as per the Company's geological model. Accordingly,\nrecent drilling has extended the understanding of mineralisation at Mont Agoma. MADD030 was drilled to follow up on tin mineralisation in MADD015 and intersected a new near-surface tin zone from 6 metres depth. MADD030A, collared from the same pad, and the findings from the\nXRF analyser\nhave confirmed continuity of this zone.\nMADD032, collared 100 metres north of MADD030, intersected a\u00a0broad, copper-rich zone\u00a0over 13 metres with a peak grade of 13% copper over 0.55 metres (Figure 1) and deeper tin and zinc mineralisation (e.g. 9\nmetres of tin within a higher grade, 13 metre wide, zinc zone).\nFigure 1. Significant visible copper mineralisation in drill core from MADD032, Mont Agoma prospect\nInterpretation of findings from drilling thus far indicates that a major fault has offset the tin zone, effectively repeating it to the east of the main zone. This structural model suggests the potential to double the mineralised strike, if confirmed by two planned holes.\nGeological Model\nRecent drilling, particularly the near-surface tin zone intersected in MADD030 and MADD030A, has helped refined the structural model for Mont Agoma.

In combining the two entities, we created a business focussed on building value in the tin and copper discoveries that Rome had made in the Bisie North Project, eastern DRC, in 2023. It also brought together two teams with strong geological expertise and operating experience in the DRC and experience of operating a public company on AIM. This was demonstrated by the fact that Rome raised \u00a34m before expenses upon Admission and a further \u00a34.2m from a DRC strategic mining investor just before year-end.\nRome hit the ground running immediately following Admission with a drilling programme at Bisie North with four drilling units probing the Kalayi and Mont Agoma Prospects, previously proven to contain tin and polymetallic tin/copper/zinc mineralisation by Rome's previous drill campaign. The operation continued beyond the reporting period and as of the date of this report, the Company has cut some 5,841m of core in this programme.\nOperating in DRC requires an intimate knowledge of business, geopolitical and regulatory conditions and this project is no exception. Operating in the jungle with no road access and albeit only 8km from Alphamin's flagship tin mine, the project still relies critically on helicopter support. We have acknowledged the additional support received from Alphamin in coordinating a temporary precautionary shutdown for security reasons in April 2025, but can report that operating conditions have essentially returned to normal.\nThe drilling was designed to further delineate the extent and size of the Kalayi tin deposit and the potential for both tin and copper at the Mont Agoma deposit. What has been achieved to date is to define the core of the Kalayi tin system and to shed further light on the complexities of the Mont Agoma system, which is a very substantial mineralised zone containing tin, copper, zinc and silver. Despite the mineralisation following the geological model of increasing tin grades with depth, the detailed inter-relationship of these mineral phases within the overall zone is still not fully understood. What can be said is that it is becoming clear that in addition to the tin, there is substantial copper and even more zinc.\nIn order to create the fullest picture of the Mont Agoma system and its multi-commodity potential, all of the assays from this campaign, which is scheduled to complete in July 2025, will be incorporated in a Maiden Resource Estimate expected to be completed on or around September 2025.\"\nPosting of Annual Report and Accounts\nThe Group also announces that it will today be posting to its shareholders the annual report and accounts.\nA copy of this announcement and the Company's report & accounts will shortly be available on the Company's website.\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/s/5b5af1\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Gasson, Chief Operating Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj / Lauren Wright (Corporate Finance)\nStefano Aquilino / Joscelin Pinnington (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nEmily Hall / Gordon Poole ",

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n26 June 2025\nRome Resources PLC\n(\"\nRome\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nOperational and Resource Update - Bisie North Project\nRome Resources plc, the DRC-focused tin and copper explorer, provides the following update on its exploration activities and forward planning at its Bisie North Project, located in the eastern DRC.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRome expects to complete the current drill programme by the end of July 2025 with the Company's contracted helicopter to be released for mandatory maintenance\n\u00b7\nInitial report suggests substantial copper, zinc and silver volumes at the Bisie North Project. However, this requires further modelling and analysis to quantify the commerciality of a combined operation with tin, copper and zinc recovery\n\u00b7\nThe assay database used in the current underlying maiden mineral resource estimate (\"MRE\") work does not include the more recent drill holes which management believes to exhibit more promising tin and copper volumes in both deeper and additional zones\n\u00b7\nMetallurgical analysis in Canada is expected to feed into the polymetallic processing flowsheet that will recover tin, copper and zinc from Mont Agoma\n\u00b7\nManagement to shift its immediate priority away from delivering a maiden MRE centred around tin mineralisation at Kalayi and Mont Agoma by end of June 2025 and instead allow for the further assessment of the copper and zinc mineralisation potential to be reported by MSA on or around September 2025\n\u00b7\nRevised maiden MRE strategy allows for the potential to establish a multi-commodity value stream proposition at the Bisie North Project\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We continue to make good progress at the Bisie North Project. The scale and quality of mineralisation across tin, copper, and zinc is becoming increasingly apparent - and we are only just beginning to test the deeper parts of the system as well as the new tin zone previously reported.\nThe decision to include both the more recent core assays in the maiden MRE and assess the commercial potential of the other commodities present, will give Rome a comprehensive maiden MRE on or around September 2025 rather than a partial picture. The Bisie North Project is shaping up to be a highly strategic, multi-commodity asset in a region of growing global interest.\"\nDrilling Operations\nHelicopter transportation support is currently unavailable to the Company due to technical issues related to the mechanical operation of the Company's contracted helicopter. As a consequence, operations at the Bisie North Project have primarily been concentrated at drill holes MADD030A and MADD031 with two drill rigs operating and the third drill rig in the midst of mobilisation.\nNoting that the Company's contracted helicopter is due for a major service before November 2025, Rome's management has concluded that it is more appropriate for the Company to release the helicopter in the near-term for servicing in Uganda rather than interrupt any later operations.\nManagement anticipates that work in relation to drill holes MADD030A, MADD031 as well as additional drill hole MADD032 (planned to follow up on the recent new tin mineralisation at depth) will be completed before the contracted helicopter departs for maintenance.\nMineralisation Indications\nWe are pleased to report that drill core from completed drilled holes MADD025, MADD027, MADD028, MADD029 and MADD030 have been cut and sampled. These drill cores are currently in transit to the laboratories in Lubumbashi and Johannesburg for sample preparation and assay respectively. Early analysis from the Company's Niton XRF portable (\"\nXRF\n\") analyser on MADD027 and MADD028 holes have shown significant propensity for tin, copper and zinc mineralisation. Visual and field XRF readings have confirmed similar observations on the remaining drill holes.\nXRF drill core analysis was conducted on drill holes MADD027 and MADD028 in which tin mineralisation was identified over 42m and 54m respectively. The highest tin grade reported in MADD027 was ~4% tin over 40cm within a broader 6m zone of approximately ~1% Sn. Drill hole MADD028 was generally of a slightly lower tenor but reported a maximum of ~2% tin over 50cm. Drilling to date has shown an increase in copper to the northwest. Narrow zones of copper up to ~4.5% Cu were reported from both holes although a highly significant copper intersection was observed over 48m in MADD029 drilled to the northwest of the two holes. In addition to the copper the XRF analysis have defined highly significant zinc intersections from both drill holes with MADD028 reporting an impressive 12m zone of ~13% Zn wi",

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n9 June 2025\nRome Resources PLC\n(\"Rome\" or the \"Company\")\nDiscovery of New Tin Zone at Mont Agoma\nRome Resources Plc (AIM: RMR), the DRC-focused tin and base metals explorer, is pleased to announce\nthe discovery of a new tin zone on the eastern flank of the Mont Agoma prospect\nat its\nflagship Bisie North project in North Kivu Province, eastern DRC.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nNew tin zone intersected\nin hole MADD030: 40m interval in shallow weathered sequence.\n\u00b7\nXRF on-site confirms significant tin mineralisation\n; assays pending.\n\u00b7\nSits outside existing soil anomaly and drilled area\n, suggesting a possible new system or fault-generated repetition.\n\u00b7\nPotential for significant upside expansion\nalong the eastern flank of Mont Agoma.\n\u00b7\nThree rigs active; four holes drilled (737m)\nsince 13 May, all encountering broad visual mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nMaiden Resource Estimate (MRE) work underway.\nFurther details\nDrill hole MADD030, located northeast of known mineralisation, intercepted a 40m wide tin-bearing zone at shallow depth. Although visual identification of cassiterite is limited in the weathered rock, initial Niton XRF readings confirms elevated tin levels, suggesting strong potential. Grades of tin mineralisation will be provided once laboratory results are reported.\nImportantly, the mineralised intercept at MADD030 lies well outside both the current mineralised footprint and the tin-in-soil geochemical anomaly\n(Figure 1)\n, potentially representing either a new tin system zone or a fault repetition of known mineralisation\n(Figure 2)\n.\nThe newly drilled zone further suggests that there could be significant additional tin resource along the eastern flank of Mont Agoma.\nFollowing the deepening of hole MADD030 (now MADD030A) to better understand the structural model, two follow-up drill holes will test the extension of this newly identified zone to the northwest.\nTo date, four holes totalling 737m have been completed since 13 May 2025 with three rigs currently drilling. All four holes have intersected visual tin, copper and zinc mineralisation and confirmed with the on-site Niton XRF analyser.\nBroader zones of mineralisation are highlighted below, with no inference as to grade:\n\u00b7\nMADD023:\n50m Sn (38 - 88m), 8m Cu (105 - 113m), 31m Zn (57 - 88m)\n\u00b7\nMADD025:\n54m Sn (123 - 177m), 6m Cu (120 - 126m), 80m Zn (106 - 186m)\n\u00b7\nMADD027:\n57m Sn (61-118m), 71m Cu (67-138m), 57m Zn (67-124m)\nSamples will be sent to ALS Global in South Africa with assay results expected before 31 July 2025.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n\"To date all the Mont Agoma drilling has focused on the main ridge where the geochemical anomaly is strongest. These initial indications from MADD030 open up the exciting scenario where tin mineralisation is present beyond the limits of our known footprint, potentially opening up the whole of the eastern flank of Mont Agoma. This is exactly the kind of upside we hoped to unlock with this new phase of drilling.\nWith three rigs turning, work in relation to our maiden mineral resource estimate underway and work due to start soon on the metallurgy of the deposit, Rome is building serious momentum on both the exploration and development fronts. We will continue sharing further updates in relation to drilling progress as well as assay results as they become available.\"\nFor more information and the chance to have your questions directly answered by the management team, please head to our interactive investor hub via:\nhttps://romeresources.com/s/5b5af1\n.

The results will be documented in an NI 43-101 Technical Report, suitable for LSE-AIM disclosure and\nwill include revieing 3D block models, incorporating grades and estimating tonnage. In addition, an assessment will be made of the prospects for eventual economic extraction\n.\nA previous NI 43-101 Technical Report was completed for Rome by MSA in 2024. Following extensive drilling since then, sufficient data has now been generated to support the creation of three dimensional mineralisation models for both prospects.\nCompletion of the maiden MRE is targeted for around the end of June 2025 at which point a summary will be released to the market and the full report available on the Company's website.\nRome is currently undertaking an aggressive deep drilling programme at Mont Agoma, with three rigs in operation targeting deeper tin mineralisation beneath the shallower copper-zinc zones.\nGiven strong momentum in the field, an update to the initial maiden MRE is expected following receipt of new assay results from the current campaign. In addition, the Company\nwill put out an update on pre-assay drill results when available, the first being on completion of the current three drill holes in the coming days.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n\"With three rigs currently operating at Mont Agoma, we are making rapid progress in testing what we believe is a large-scale, high-value copper-tin-zinc-silver system. The data collected so far is robust enough to support our maiden resource estimates for both Kalayi and Mont Agoma, and we are pleased to appoint MSA to carry out this important milestone for the Company.\"\n\"The geology is shaping up as we had hoped - with copper and zinc dominant near surface and tin strengthening at depth - confirming the zonation model we are targeting.

This follows the positive news that the M23 rebel group have withdrawn from the region as well as that operations at other projects in close proximity to Rome, including Alphamin Resources, are now restarting. The objective of this fully funded, additional drilling programme is to identify high grade tin at deeper levels, in line with the Company's geological model of tin grades increasing at depth.\nAs part of its preparation to commence drilling, Rome is also now in the process of obtaining the required permitting to mobilise the helicopter under contract with the South African fleet provider, BAC Helicopters, from Entebbe in Uganda to Kisangani, with the current aim for the helicopter to be on site by 1 May 2025.\nThe temporary pause in drilling operations has allowed Rome's drilling contractors to adequately prepare for the next phase of deeper drilling which will commence shortly after all personnel have mobilised back to site.\nThe estimated cost of this next phase of drilling is approximately $1.6 million, comfortably within its current cash reserves of approximately $2.7 million.\nLastly, Rome is now expecting results for drill holes MADD024 and MADD026. Samples from drill holes MADD024 and MADD026 were prepared at COAL laboratories in Lubumbashi and the pulps have now been submitted to ALS Global in Johannesburg, South Africa, where the Company has been informed to expect a maximum of a two-week turnaround.\nRome intends to incorporate these results into its maiden inferred mineral resource estimate for the Mont Agoma and Kalayi Prospects and accordingly, this is now expected to be announced on or around mid to late May 2025.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n\"We are extremely pleased to note the news in recent weeks of the withdrawal of M23 rebels in the region and to now be preparing to mobilise and recommence operations at the Bisie North Project, with the upcoming drilling intended to extend exploration at further depth, where the geological model predicts higher grades of tin.\nThe pause in drilling operations has allowed our drilling contractors to source all drill rig spare parts and rods and adequately prepare for the next stage of operations, which we aim to kick off as soon as the team are back on site. We look forward to updating the market in the coming weeks with the drilling results from previous holes MADD024 and MADD026, which will provide further details on the size and prospectivity of the resource.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/s/2b8304\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Gasson, Chief Operating Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj / Lauren Wright (Corporate Finance)\nStefano Aquilino / Joscelin Pinnington (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Emily Hall / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n20 March 2025\nRome Resources Plc\n(\"Rome\" or the \"Company\")\nSettlement of\nclaim against the\u00a0Mozambique\u00a0Government for the expropriation of Mining Concession 4623C\nRome Resources Plc (AIM: RMR), the DRC-focused tin and base metals explorer,\u00a0is pleased to announce that it has entered into a settlement agreement with IM Minerals Limited (\"\nIM\n\") and\nthe Mozambique government (the \"\nSettlement\n\") in relation to the Company's legacy claim over the expropriation of a heavy mineral sand mining concession 4623C in 2011 (the \"\nClaim\n\").\nRome was formerly named Pathfinder Minerals plc (\"\nPathfinder\n\") until 24 July 2024.\nAs part of the Settlement, the Mozambique government has agreed to grant five new research and exploration licences to a registered Mozambican company (or companies) to be nominated by IM (the \"\nNew Licences\n\"). In this regard, Rome will receive a 30 per cent. carried interest in the future value of the New Licences, as further described below.\nBackground to the Claim\nThe Claim was sold by Pathfinder to Acumen Advisory Group LLC (\"\nAcumen\n\") by way of a sale of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, IM, which completed on 18 August 2023. The Claim was subsequently sold by Acumen to Luangwa Resources LLC (\"\nLuangwa\n\"), as announced on 29 January 2024 (the \"\nDisposal\n\").\nSince then, and during the course of negotiations it became apparent that the Mozambican government justified the expropriation of mining concession 4623C on the basis of purported failures by the Company's previous management to put in place sufficient safeguards prior to the expropriation. This resulted in a perceived weakening of the Claim. Consequently, the Mozambique government did not offer a cash settlement, resulting in a subsequent period of further negotiation over a number of replacement New Licences which was ultimately offered in lieu of a cash settlement.\nSettlement details\nThe New Licences that form the Settlement are as follows:\nGraphite Potential\na. Area 1 of Licence No. 5197, covering a surface area of 18,857 ha (hectares);\nb. Area 2 of Licence No. 5197, covering a surface area of 14,003 ha;\nHeavy Mineral Sands Potential\nc. Licence No. 5186, covering a surface area of 14,340 ha;\nd. Licence No. 11344, covering a surface area of 11,673 ha; and\ne. Licence No. 9844, covering a surface area of 860 ha.\nThe New Licences represents in aggregate approximately 59,733 hectares (597km2 or 147,540 acres), which is equivalent to an area the size of the Isle of Man.\nTwo of the licences that form part of the New Licence areas are extensions of active graphite mining projects and are anticipated to be the subject of an early marketing campaign to generate cash returns for Luangwa. The remaining three licences will require further technical work to mature the projects to marketable status.\nFurther details of Rome's interest\nWhile Luangwa will ultimately control the New Licences, under the terms of a side agreement entered into with Luangwa following the Settlement (the \"\nSide Agreement\n\"), Rome will receive a fixed 30 per cent. carried interest in either the individual entities holding each licence or the holding company that ultimately holds the New Licences. Rome will not be required to contribute to any exploration expenditure or other costs in relation to the New Licences and will maintain a passive interest.\nThe Company has agreed with Luangwa that if any value in the New Licences is realized through either a disposal, share sale, listing or a farm-in agreement, then if the aggregate amount of cash available for distribution following such event is less than US$7 million, Luangwa's reasonable costs up to a maximum of US$2 million shall be taken into account prior to any cash distribution to the Company. In the event that the distributable cash available is greater than US$7 million, then these costs will not be taken into account.\nPotential distribution to legacy Pathfinder shareholders\nAs noted in the Company's announcements on 16 August 2023 and 1 September 2023, shareholders in the Company as at 6:00pm on 5 September 2023 will be entitled to a \"Bonus Preference Share\" entitling the holder thereof to receive, subject to the Companies Act 2006, a preferential dividend equal to the damages award that the Company may receive pursuant to the Claim. It was also noted that if no award proceeds are received by the Company pursuant to the Claim, no amount shall be payable to the holders of the Bonus Preference Shares by the Company.\nWhile the board of directors of Rome (the \"\nBoard\n\" or the \"\nDirectors\n\") welcomes the positive news concerning the Settlement, including the issue of",

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n14 March 2025\nRome Resources Plc\n(\"Rome\" or the \"Company\")\nDrilling & Operations Update\nRome Resources Plc (AIM: RMR), the DRC-focused tin and base metals explorer,\u00a0provides the following update in relation to its exploratory drilling programme in the Bisie North Permit area.\nFollowing completion of the last two exploratory holes, MADD024 and MADD026, the total metres drilled to date at the Bisie North Project is 2,181 metres from 10 holes at Mont Agoma and 2,264 metres from 18 holes at Kalayi. As noted in the Company's announcement released on 13 March 2025, Rome has now temporarily paused its drilling operations in advance of undertaking a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate of both the Kalayi and Mont Agoma prospects.\nSignificant zones of visible tin and copper mineralisation were intersected in both drill holes and included:\nMADD024\n\u00b7\n27m of tin from 158m - 185m.\n\u00b7\n112m of copper - 33m from 57m - 90m; 15m from 108m - 123m; 37m from 152m - 189m and 27m from 209m - 236m.\nMADD026\n\u00b7\n25m of tin from 174m - 201m.\n\u00b7\n54m of copper - 13m from 109m - 122m and 41m from 174m - 215m.\nAs previously announced, MADD024 was drilled approximately 70m below MADD012 and therefore it is anticipated that the tin grade improves at depth from the previously reported 0.1-0.5% at MAD0012.\nMADD026 was drilled 50m south of MADD024 and approximately 70m below MADD011 which reported a best tin zone of 9m at 0.25% from 122m. The company believes this is the same structure being intersected, only deeper in the system, therefore an improvement of grade is also expected.\nThe Company expects the copper in both holes to be similar in nature to the higher grades seen in the more central section of the licence.\nThe samples from the mineralised sections in both drill holes have been processed on site and are currently being transported to Lubumbashi for sample preparation prior to analyses in Johannesburg.\nOnce results have been reported, the Company expects to progress towards a maiden inferred mineral resource estimates at both Kalayi and Mont Agoma. This is expected before the end of April 2025.\nOperational update:\nIn light of the latest developments surrounding advances made by M23 and current drilling milestones achieved at Kalayi, and more recently with the completed MADD024 and MADD026 holes at Mont Agoma, the Company has decided to temporarily pause drilling operations at its Bisie North Project. This temporary pause will also allow the drilling contractors to source all drill rig spare parts and rods via Kisangani given their supply chain from Goma was severed through the closure of the Goma airport.\nThe Company highlights that all the drilling crews are paid on a per meter basis. As a result, during periods of inactivity there will be no cost to Rome from the drilling contractors.\nWhile the Company continues to closely monitor the situation, Rome also welcomes the recent news reports noting potential peace talks being brokered by Angola in relation to the current conflict between the DRC and M23.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have gathered significant data from our two most recent drill holes at Mont Agoma which strongly support our geological model.\nFollowing the evacuation of Alphamin's Bisie mine site and their kind offer of assistance, we saw this as an opportune time to strategically pause operations enabling our service providers to carry out their required maintenance.\nWe are pleased to work with our service providers to ensure the best use of Company's funds during this time of reduced activity, placing the Company in a much stronger position for when we commence drilling.\nWe thank Alphamin for their support during this time and we look forward to updating the market with the assays from holes MADD024 and MADD026 in due course as well as our maiden inferred mineral resource estimate.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/5Pmg6e\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Gasson, Chief Operating Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj / Lauren Wright (Corporate Finance)\nStefano Aquilino / Joscelin Pinnington (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nemail: jerry.keen@oak-securities.com\nemail: henry.clarke@oak-securities.com\nT",

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n04 March 2025\nRome Resources Plc\n(\"Rome\" or the \"Company\")\n148m Copper Intersect Expands the Large-Scale Polymetallic Potential at Mont Agoma\nRome Resources Plc (AIM: RMR), the DRC-focused tin and base metals explorer, is pleased to announce assay results from drill hole MADD018 at its Mont Agoma prospect, confirming a\n62.25m cumulative higher-grade zone at 0.61% Cu within a broader 148m intercept averaging 0.35% Cu\n.\nRecent drilling has identified visible tin across a 40m interval in hole MADD024 and an associated visible copper zone totalling 179m. MADD024 is approximately 70m beneath the earlier hole MADD012, which reported a c40m wide zone of tin with zones of tin grading at between 0.1-0.3% tin.\nThe Company awaits the assay results for\nMADD024\nfrom the lab, however, the visuals (see image below) and Niton XRF readings suggest that tin grade is increasing with depth, demonstrating proof of the Company's suggested geological model and supports Rome's strategy of drilling deeper to assess the tin mineralisation.\nPrevious drilling at Mont Agoma has returned significant results including 41m at 3.52% Cu, 90m at 4.17% Zn and 25.4m at 13.97% Zn and 14.15m at 57.74ppm g/t. The equivalent copper grades for the zinc intercepts would equate to 90m at 1.2% Cu and 25.4m at 4.1% Cu.\nThe\u00a0scale and continuity\u00a0of the tin, copper, zinc and silver mineralisation identified within the broad 200m wide mineralised corridor is aligned with the Company's board of directors' (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") view that Mont Agoma hosts a robust polymetallic mineralised system in which copper and zinc dominate the shallow, near surface levels and that tin mineralisation identified within broad zones increases at depth.\nWith mineralisation remaining open along strike and at depth, these intercepts provide a strong foundation for continued deeper drilling to define the full extent of this growing discovery.\nThe Company has also commenced metallurgical discussions with industry specialists to seek to ensure maximum recoveries of all commodities identified at Mont Agoma and Kalayi.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n\"The confirmation of 148m of copper mineralisation at Mont Agoma is a major milestone in defining the potential scale of this system. These results demonstrate that Mont Agoma hosts a large-scale, high-value copper-tin-zin-silver system, where copper and zinc dominate at shallower near surface levels and tin grades strengthen at depth - exactly the zonation model we are targeting.\n\"Importantly, mineralisation remains open along strike and at depth, with extensions of 1,000m northward providing further potential upside for scale. Whilst it is still early days and we need to receive the assays back from the lab for MAD0024, early indications seem to very encouraging in proving up our understanding of the geological model.\n\"With all four drill rigs now focused at Mont Agoma, we are accelerating exploration efforts, next steps include\u00a0exploring deeper to assess increasing tin grades and ongoing strike extension drilling\u00a0continuing strike extension drilling.\nThis expanded drill programme will drive continuous results, delivering a steady stream of newsflow as we work towards defining a major copper-tin system.\nAs we advance, we are making excellent progress to\nwards a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate\n.\"\nFigure 1\n: Drill core from MADD024 showing C\nassiterite (tin)- brown colour (between yello\nw\nchalk markers) and Chalcopyrite (copper) - golden colour\nKey Highlights from\nMADD018 (shown in Table 1)\n:\n\u00b7\nSignificant Copper Zone\n: 148m @ 0.35% Cu from 73.6m, including:\no\n5m at 0.84% Cu from 79.0m\no\n3.25m at 0.64% Cu from 97.8m\no\n10.5m at 0.56% Cu from 109.5m\no\n6m at 0.76% Cu from 129m\no\n9.75m at 0.68% Cu from 172m\no\n7m at 0.69% Cu from 185m\no\n17.25m at 0.43% Cu from 199m\no\n3.5m at 0.65% Cu from 234.5m\n\u00b7\nZinc Mineralisation\n:\no\n13m @ 1.20% Zn\no\n7.17m @ 1.06% Zn\no\n14.0m @ 1.40% Zn\nMont Agoma Advancing as a Large-Scale Copper-Tin-Zinc-Silver System\n\u00b7\nHigh grade polymetallic mineralisation defined over 500m of geological strike length drilled to date -\nremains open for more than 1km to the northwest and is open at depth and to the southeast.\n\u00b7\nHigh grade copper and zinc mineralisation dominant over 200m width down to depths exceeding 200m below surface -\nconsidered to have significant open pit resource potential.\n\u00b7\nCopper dominant to the northwest and zinc dominant to the southeast of current drilling\n- correlates with a 2,000m copper in soil anomaly which is open for a further 1,000m to the north and a zinc anomaly which continues fo",

These results confirm\u00a0the presence of high-grade tin mineralisation across multiple sub-parallel ore shoots validating the Company's geological model and reinforcing the potential of tin as the Company's drilling campaign moves closer to the interpreted granitic source.\nThe Company remains focused on defining a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate at Kalayi on its Bisie North Project, with drilling covering only 30% of the identified 2,000m tin-in-soil anomaly. Mineralisation has been confirmed from surface, remaining open at depths beyond 250m, with visible cassiterite observed in the deepest hole to date (~ 220m below surface).\nKalayi Highlights: Expanding Potential with High-Grade Tin\n\u00b7\nKBDD015:\n3.3m at 1.77% Sn\nfrom 96.85m;\n5.7m at 1.35% Sn\nfrom 147.90m (including\n2.85m at 1.98% Sn\n); and\n\u00b7\nKBDD016:\n9.5m at 0.60% Sn from 126.45m (including\n1.7m at 1.61% Sn\n)\nKey Takeaways:\n\u00b7\nStrong mineralisation continuity\n: Assay results confirm a\u00a0pinch-and-swell system, with tin mineralisation remaining open\u00a0beyond 250m depth.\n\u00b7\nFinal drill holes underway\n: Two additional shallower holes will complete the current drill programme.\n\u00b7\nAssay results from two holes remain\n: Assay results from the southernmost hole and the deepest drilled to date at Kalayi are expected to show continuity of mineralisation on strike and at depth.\n\u00b7\nGeological similarity to Alphamin\n: The system continues to show characteristics similar to\u00a0Alphamin's Mpama South deposit, with potential for deeper high-grade mineralised zones.\n\u00b7\nDepth extension strengthens resource potential:\nTin mineralisation intercepted 80m below KBDD015 and KBDD016 is expected to\u00a0materially enhance\u00a0the resource potential, significantly expanding the known mineralised system.\n\u00b7\nTin market strength\n: With tin prices nearing\n~US$34,000/t\n, these intercepts highlight the potential for economic mineralisation, particularly as drilling extends deeper.\nThe drill rig at Kalayi was mobilised to Mont Agoma to improve productivity where adverse drilling conditions have resulted in delays to completing the initial Mont Agoma programme. The rig will be returned to Kalayi in due course to\ncomplete the remaining holes\n, ensuring the\npartial extent of the tin system\nis captured in the upcoming maiden inferred resource estimate.\nExploration Update & Forward Plan\n\u00b7\nRome remains\u00a0fully funded for its current programme following its \u00a34.2 million strategic investment from Stanvic Mining, enabling an\u00a0accelerated exploration programme in 2025.\n\u00b7\nAssay results from\u00a0MADD018 at Mont Agoma, which intersected over\u00a0100m of visible copper mineralisation, are\u00a0expected to be available shortly. This will be a critical test for the potential scale of copper mineralisation associated with the 2,000m copper in soil anomaly.\n\u00b7\nDrilling continues at\u00a0both Kalayi and Mont Agoma, with a focus on extending\u00a0high-grade tin zones\u00a0and advancing towards a\u00a0maiden inferred mineral resource estimate.\n\u00b7\nOngoing deeper drilling is testing the\u00a0mineralisation zonation model, seen in\u00a0world-class tin mines such as Alphamin's Mpama deposits and San Rafael in Peru, where grades have strengthened significantly at depth.\n\u00b7\nDrill results at Kalayi\u00a0confirm\u00a0economic-grade tin mineralisation\u00a0and support the\u00a0potential for open-pit development, with mineralisation now confirmed across multiple zones.\nOperations remain unaffected\u00a0by unrest in Goma and Bukavu\n. The Company has proactively\u00a0relocated its logistical base\u00a0to Kisangani, ensuring\u00a0full operational capacity and continuity of exploration. The remote proximity of Rome's projects as well as the limited infrastructure surrounding the projects reduces the Company's exposure to regional unrest.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n\"With tin trading at near-record levels of ~US$34,000/t, our latest results further reinforce Kalayi's economic potential. These new results build on our confidence in the project's growing scale and the continuity of high-grade tin mineralisation at depth. We now have clear evidence of a strong system extending across multiple zones, improving widths and grades as we drill deeper towards the granite source.\"\n\"With over 4,135m drilled to date, we are moving rapidly towards defining our maiden inferred mineral",

This reinforces the Company's zonation model that tin mineralisation strengthens towards the granite source.\nDeeper drilling is now targeting these higher-grade extensions\n, with results expected from KBDD016 in\nQ1 2025\n.\nCurrent hole KBDD018, shown in Figure 1, is targeting the zone roughly 80m below the 10m wide zone seen in KBDD016 as it is anticipated that the grade will increase at depth.\nWith tin currently trading at\n~US$30,000/t\n, these results indicate the\npotential for economic mineralisation\n, particularly if drilling defines high-grade zones at depth.\nExploration Update & Forward Plan\n\u00b7\nRome remains\u00a0fully funded following its \u00a34.2 million strategic investment from Stanvic Mining, enabling an\u00a0accelerated exploration programme in 2025.\n\u00b7\nAdditional assay results are pending from\u00a0MADD018 at Mont Agoma, which intersected\u00a0>100m of visible copper mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nDrilling continues\u00a0at both Kalayi and Mont Agoma, with a focus on extending known tin zones and advancing towards a\u00a0proposed maiden\ninferred mineral resource estimate\nin Q1 2025.\n\u00b7\nOngoing deeper drilling aims to validate the zonation model seen at world-class tin mines, including Alphamin, where tin grades have strengthened with depth and Rome will continue testing mineralisation at comparable depths.\n\u00b7\nOperations and on-site activities continue to remain unaffected by the unrest in the city of Goma.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n''These latest results from Kalayi build on the success of our last drilling campaign, reinforcing our confidence in Kalayi's growing scale, with mineralisation now confirmed across multiple zones and improving as we drill deeper towards the granite source. The large 10m cassiterite intersection from KBDD016 at depth is particularly exciting, and we look forward to receiving assays from this key zone shortly as well as MADD018 from Mont Agoma where over 100m of visible copper mineralisation was observed.\"\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear that we are unlocking a simple, open pittable, high-grade tin resource which, due to the pinch and swell geometry, indicates that there is potential for even greater widths of high-grade mineralisation both at depth and along strike.\"\n\"We are continuing to accelerate the drilling programme at both Kalayi and Mont Agoma concurrently, with a combined total of 3,735m drilled at present. We look forward to updating the market as we receive more assay results and build a clearer picture of these exciting resources.

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n21 January 2025\nRome Resources Plc\n(\"Rome\"\nor the\n\"Company\")\nLABORATORY RESULTS CONFIRM SIGNIFICANT WIDTHS OF TIN MINERALISATION AT MONT AGOMA\nRome Resources Plc (AIM: RMR), the DRC-focused tin explorer, is pleased to announce laboratory results from the latest drilling campaign at its Mont Agoma tin prospect located in the North Kivu province (\"\nMont Agoma\n\") in the Democratic Republic of Congo (the \"\nDRC\n\").\nAssays from the first two of five completed diamond core drill holes confirm significant widths of tin mineralisation across three discrete zones within the tin, copper and zinc zone with combined widths of\n38.4m\nin MADD016A and\n32.1m\nin MADD017 which ended in mineralisation. Encouragingly, increased tin grades and visible cassiterite (tin mineral) was noted within the deeper intersection in MADD017 supporting the Company's zonation model in which tin mineralisation increases at depths closer to the granitic source. To that end, going forward the Company will concentrate the drilling programme on evaluating how the mineralisation develops with depth of approximately 100m below current intercepts.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\n1,657m completed from eight holes at Mont Agoma (3 ongoing) since drilling commenced in August 2024.\n\u00b7\nMADD016A:\no\n3m at 0.27% Sn from 46.5m; 20.5m at 0.18% Sn from 57.5m; 14.9m at 0.45% from 99m.\nTotal width of 38.4m of tin mineralisation.\no\n3.9m at 1.24% Cu from 71.2m; 1.7m at 4.8% Cu from 95.3m; 7.2m at 1.32% Cu from 212.4m.\no\n31.0m at 4.02% Zn from 92m.\n\u00b7\nMADD017:\no\n4m at 0.44% Sn from 72m; 10.5m at 0.28% Sn from 116.5m; 9.6m at 0.37% from 130m; 8m at 0.49% Sn from 154m, terminating early in mineralisation.\nTotal width of 32.1m of tin mineralisation.\no\n25.35m at 13.97% Zn from 110.1m.\n\u00b7\nEarly indications suggest that mineralisation at Mont Agoma aligns with the copper to tin mineralisation transition zone at San Rafael in Peru\n- with decreasing copper and increasing tin at greater depth.\n\u00b7\nCopper mineralisation potentially within a high-grade shoot plunging to the northwest -\nwith over 100m of visible copper identified in MADD018\n, the northernmost drill hole.\n\u00b7\nHigh grade zinc identified throughout the 500m strike length drilled to date in a similar setting comparable to Mpama South deposit, operated by Alphamin.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation remains open to the north, south and at depth.\n\u00b7\nWell placed to continue deeper drilling throughout 2025 following the recent fundraise with Stanvic Mining.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources Plc, commented:\n''We are extremely encouraged by the widths and grades of tin mineralisation intersected in holes MADD016A and MADD017 which confirms tin, copper and zinc mineralisation within the upper levels of the mineralised zonation model where lower grade tin is expected in association with high grade copper. With more than 200m width of confirmed sulphide mineralisation, it is becoming increasingly clear that we are unlocking a complex mineralised system with an increase in widths of tin mineralisation towards the base of the copper zone. Our ongoing deeper drilling campaign will soon reach similar depths where Alphamin's main resources are located.\nFollowing our successful \u00a34.2 million fundraising with Stanvic Mining, we are in a strong position to continue drilling at the Mont Agoma and Kalayi prospects, particularly targeting deeper levels on both prospects where there are clear signposts that mineralisation increases at depth.\nThe results from these last two holes significantly increases our confidence in finding high-grade tin mineralisation as new drilling moves to deeper levels, and we look forward to updating the market as the drilling programme continues to progress.''\nFurther information in relation to the results:\nGeneral\nSignificant intersections of Zinc was reported for both drill holes which is similar to the mineralisation reported at Alphamin's Mpama South which reported high grade zinc within parallel structures in close proximity to the tin mineralisation. Results are summarised in Table 1 and shown in Figure 2.\nResults indicate that copper mineralisation is focused within a high-grade shoot plunging to the northwest. Copper widths appear to decrease towards the southeast (current drill holes) but increase towards the northwest where\nmore than 100m of visual copper mineralisation\n(confirmed by the handheld Niton XRF analysis) was intersected in MADD018 on the northernmost drill line. Best continuous tin results to date have been reported in the southern drill holes where tin mineralisation has been reported over significant widths, albeit of a lower tenor closer to surface",

Whilst we should consider the positive spin it is also important to balance with the potential negative scenario. In PB's new year video he specifically referenced Jamie as a key member of the team on the ground and effectively said he had stepped up and filled some of Mark Gasson's role. He went as far as to state that Jamie was married with a family in DRC and was therefore a permanent fixture. What are the scenarios? 1) Jamie has a family and was offered more money, after all he was at Alphamin before so perhaps they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 2) He can continue to consult for RMR beyond March. 3) He knows AFM will acquire RMR in the near future anyway so he will still be working those assets. 4) He is jumping ship... Let's hope PB can provide some more detail. On the security situation - that paragraph has appeared in the last 2 operational updates so I think it is important everyone remains vigilant that despite the MSM headlines, the situation is still extremely volatile on the ground. Will update the board if I hear.",

The guy was not fully employed by RMR I don't think, he was probably part of a team that are self employed as it would make no sense keeping someone on because they don't drill all the year around. That is probably the reason why they were going to get someone to replace  Mark Gasson. The longer they take to replace Mark or Jamie the better as it shows that something is going on",

However the  recruitment of Jamie Anderson  by Alphamin can only be seen as a positive, Firstly, he is leaving once the second round of drilling is complete, secondly, as I said Alphamin have not had a material find of new Tin as far as I am aware  and Paul Barrett has already stated that once this is completed and the results are reasonable they ar going to try and do an arrangement with one or maybe two companies. I don't think there is any reason to panic",

Having read the Alphamin  report,  Jamie  Anderson going to Alphamin is a situation that must of been known at Board level and not announcing it could not be material because they have a duty to report. The security situation is again a standard comment that has to be reported which I consider not too important as again it is vital that a Company report anything that may be on the horizon. To say the two announcements are bombshells Ithink is a bit of an overstatement, yes we should know and thatks for telling us but I don't think it is as dramatic as you say. What is very important is that Alphamins latest  exploration drilling for new Tin finds show nothing has been found so far.",

Could he perform both roles? Maybe....PB needs to clarify ASAP. If not then this is a blow having lost Mark Gasson recently. Who knows if this is a positive in the long run, having someone with an intimate knowledge of Rome's prospectivity in a senior position within Alphamin, but it leaves uncertainty beyond March. 2) Alphamin highlights a deteriorating security situation which, if it progresses further, could affect mining operations. An Alphamin shut down would be catastrophic for RMR share price. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and time horizon and will make their own decisions but just wanted to make everyone aware.

I think at the moment traders are taking positions to make a quick buck as we found out when the MRE was announced.  The Company are sending out lots of interviews and messages on Linkedin etc etc but they need to show the market that they have something serious that warrants longer term investors coming in. Managing expectations has always been a problem with AIM companies however I do believe that this is a better run outfit than others and hopefully Mark Gasson will leave his family proud  and richer.",

Obviously, patience is key, the reaction to the MRE as far as I am concerned has a mixture of angles to it. Firstly, there probably were quite a few investors thinking that Bonanza grade was going to be found in the shallow drilling, or the results from the shallow drilling was not good enough. However, seeing as Alphamin found nothing on the first set of drilling results make me feel the oposite. Secondly, Traders bought in just to dump afterwards and as there was no spike in the price after the MRE they all left which resulted in a plummet. The AIM market is fickel and difficult and very high risk. Even so, I think we will strike good grades, or should I say I hope we will. Then we shall see what goes from there. There also seem to be no people who want to discuss things as there is little to say until results start coming through",

          "content": "Shreksdonkey Great name!!   Interesting post. I know that Brokers get up to all sorts of tricks to make a good return. However, from what I know, the Brokers were the ones who introduced RMR to Pathfinder and although they are a small  boutique Company, they seem to want to be in there for the longer term which to me means that shorting a small  illiquid stock seems a bit strange or at least a bit unlikely. However these Companies to me are quite flackey and not to be trusted.  I have said before that one of  the reasons that the SP fell sharply was because of the expctations of others. The main question is do you trust the management? I think they will find a healthy amount of Tin and the Copper/ Zinc is a bit of cream on the cake. The other main area to feel confident on is that if we can find up to 200k tons of Tin or 175k and open at strike both ends then it would be of great value to Alphamin, is they bought RMR it would also revalue their Company because of the reserves they have Given that they produce about 18000 tons a year, RMR would give Alphamin a great life of mines and the return for  IRH would be incredible. Her's hopeing for a good drilling campaign",

          "content": "@make5mil - hopefully! @edzi - I have contacted Paul and Klaus to seek clarification on the Jamie Anderson situation. Whilst we should consider the positive spin it is also important to balance with the potential negative scenario. In PB's new year video he specifically referenced Jamie as a key member of the team on the ground and effectively said he had stepped up and filled some of Mark Gasson's role. He went as far as to state that Jamie was married with a family in DRC and was therefore a permanent fixture. What are the scenarios? 1) Jamie has a family and was offered more money, after all he was at Alphamin before so perhaps they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 2) He can continue to consult for RMR beyond March. 3) He knows AFM will acquire RMR in the near future anyway so he will still be working those assets. 4) He is jumping ship... Let's hope PB can provide some more detail. On the security situation - that paragraph has appeared in the last 2 operational updates so I think it is important everyone remains vigilant that despite the MSM headlines, the situation is still extremely volatile on the ground. Will update the board if I hear.",

That is probably the reason why they were going to get someone to replace  Mark Gasson. The longer they take to replace Mark or Jamie the better as it shows that something is going on",

However the  recruitment of Jamie Anderson  by Alphamin can only be seen as a positive, Firstly, he is leaving once the second round of drilling is complete, secondly, as I said Alphamin have not had a material find of new Tin as far as I am aware  and Paul Barrett has already stated that once this is completed and the results are reasonable they ar going to try and do an arrangement with one or maybe two companies.

Having read the Alphamin  report,  Jamie  Anderson going to Alphamin is a situation that must of been known at Board level and not announcing it could not be material because they have a duty to report. The security situation is again a standard comment that has to be reported which I consider not too important as again it is vital that a Company report anything that may be on the horizon. To say the two announcements are bombshells Ithink is a bit of an overstatement, yes we should know and thatks for telling us but I don't think it is as dramatic as you say. What is very important is that Alphamins latest  exploration drilling for new Tin finds show nothing has been found so far.",

Could he perform both roles? Maybe....PB needs to clarify ASAP. If not then this is a blow having lost Mark Gasson recently. Who knows if this is a positive in the long run, having someone with an intimate knowledge of Rome's prospectivity in a senior position within Alphamin, but it leaves uncertainty beyond March. 2) Alphamin highlights a deteriorating security situation which, if it progresses further, could affect mining operations. An Alphamin shut down would be catastrophic for RMR share price. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and time horizon and will make their own decisions but just wanted to make everyone aware.

I think at the moment traders are taking positions to make a quick buck as we found out when the MRE was announced.  The Company are sending out lots of interviews and messages on Linkedin etc etc but they need to show the market that they have something serious that warrants longer term investors coming in. Managing expectations has always been a problem with AIM companies however I do believe that this is a better run outfit than others and hopefully Mark Gasson will leave his family proud  and richer.",

          "content": "Hi Itzagamble Your words are my very thoughts, and probably others I'm sure.  Obviously, patience is key, the reaction to the MRE as far as I am concerned has a mixture of angles to it. Firstly, there probably were quite a few investors thinking that Bonanza grade was going to be found in the shallow drilling, or the results from the shallow drilling was not good enough. However, seeing as Alphamin found nothing on the first set of drilling results make me feel the oposite. Secondly, Traders bought in just to dump afterwards and as there was no spike in the price after the MRE they all left which resulted in a plummet. The AIM market is fickel and difficult and very high risk. Even so, I think we will strike good grades, or should I say I hope we will. Then we shall see what goes from there. There also seem to be no people who want to discuss things as there is little to say until results start coming through",

          "content": "Shreksdonkey Great name!!   Interesting post. I know that Brokers get up to all sorts of tricks to make a good return. However, from what I know, the Brokers were the ones who introduced RMR to Pathfinder and although they are a small  boutique Company, they seem to want to be in there for the longer term which to me means that shorting a small  illiquid stock seems a bit strange or at least a bit unlikely. However these Companies to me are quite flackey and not to be trusted.  I have said before that one of  the reasons that the SP fell sharply was because of the expctations of others. The main question is do you trust the management? I think they will find a healthy amount of Tin and the Copper/ Zinc is a bit of cream on the cake. The other main area to feel confident on is that if we can find up to 200k tons of Tin or 175k and open at strike both ends then it would be of great value to Alphamin, is they bought RMR it would also revalue their Company because of the reserves they have Given that they produce about 18000 tons a year, RMR would give Alphamin a great life of mines and the return for  IRH would be incredible. Her's hopeing for a good drilling campaign",

This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post maiden MRE drilling programme, with drilling at Kalayi continuing to demonstrate that near-surface high-grade tin mineralisation continues at depth.\nFour new drillholes have completed (five in total at Kalayi), with a further hole approaching its target depth. Initial on-site portable handheld XRF readings summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillholes KBDD020 to KBDD023 with average grades of mineralisation and depths tested:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD023 encountered\n2m @ 8.30% tin\nfrom 74 metres depth and\n5m @ 0.48% tin\nfrom 86 metres.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD021 encountered\n2m @ 2.23% tin\nfrom 181 metres depth and\n2m @ 2.33% copper\nfrom 107 metres.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD022 encountered 1m @ 1.89% tin at 54 metres depth, 1m @ 1.35% tin at 68 metres depth and 1m @ 0.34% tin at 72m.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD020 was abandoned at 40.5 metres and redrilled to a depth of 135.0 metres, without encountering significant tin mineralisation.\nFigure 1:\nDrill core showing visible cassiterite (brown) within a broader ~2.0 m mineralised interval, with portable handheld XRF readings indicating an average grade of ~8.3% Sn.\nThe handheld XRF used at Bisie North is a Thermo Scientific NitonTM XL3t model. Readings represent averages of 60 second continuous analysis along 1m sections of core. The X-ray beam is emitted through an 8mm window and penetrates up to several millimetres into the drill core. The metal grades determined by the portable handheld XRF are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for resource estimation. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay, with results to be reported in due course.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\nUp to four further drill holes (including the current hole) are planned on Kalayi to continue testing the down-plunge extent of tin mineralisation, after which drilling will resume at Mont Agoma where the Company is targeting deeper tin-rich zones beneath the established polymetallic system.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We continue to be encouraged by this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is considered consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation. These results further support our view that Kalayi hosts high-grade tin shoots that persist below the depths tested to date.\nDrilling will move to Mont Agoma in the coming weeks. We look forward to regularly updating the market as drilling continues on both prospects and further results become available.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/rAk8wy\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDr. Paul Armitage is a consultant of Rome Resources plc, a qualified geologist, a Fellow of the London Geological Society and a Member of the\nInstitute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\n.

This update follows the drilling update provided on 16 January 2026.\nMetallurgical testing was undertaken by SGS on bulk samples from the tin, copper and zinc zones in order to assess the potential for commercial recovery of the various commodity metals from the ore. The results for copper and tin recovery are encouraging.\n\u00b7\nThe tin zone sample has responded well to gravity pre-concentration with 80% of the Sn reporting to a first concentrate at a grade of over 10% Sn from a head grade of 0.6% Sn in less than 5% of the mass.\n\u00b7\nThe copper zone sample has also responded well to gravity pre-concentration with 96% of the Cu reporting to a concentrate at a grade of 3.7% Cu from a head grade of 2.4% Cu in less than 63% of the mass.\n\u00b7\nThe copper sample responded very well to flotation with 95.5% of the Cu reporting to the rougher flotation at a grade of 9.5% Cu. The Zn in this sample followed the Cu and differential flotation may therefore be considered to separate the Cu and Zn.\nIn all cases customary cleaning of the tin and copper concentrates will be required in order to raise the grade to export levels.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, said:\n\"These preliminary results are highly encouraging for the potential commercialisation of both the tin and copper at Bisie North. As the copper is developed at shallow depths in the Mont Agoma deposit, recovery and monetisation of this is expected to be highly accretive to the overall project economics.\nCurrently, the drilling campaign at Kalayi continues and we will move to Mont Agoma next month to test further the extent of the tin and copper mineralisation. We will update the market in due course.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/PBJ17P\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDave Dodd is technical director at Rainbow Rare Earths Limited, holds a BSc in Chem Eng (Manchester) and is a Fellow of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

When they get over 0.30 they are probably on their way. The point I want to make is that there are so many small Companies that do not keep their shareholders in the loop as to what is going on, Jubilee metals which I was in is one of them. However if you do notify the market of things that are going on like drill results or the capability of extrcating ore from what you have some seem to comment on it like you are trying too hard.  You just can't win. I am more than happy that we are kept up to date and the style of reporting to me is not hyperbole but factual.  The board or rather Paul and Klaus would look pretty bloody stupid if what they say is there is NOT. Although I am still agravated regarding the sell of when the first set of figures came out I think and hope that this slow build up will get us to near where we should be which to me is between 0.75 and 1p after the results are out. Comments please as this seems to be a bit of a boring board for interaction",

The most recent bulletins indicate that out of a few holes drilled late in 2025, visible tin mineralisation was not observed in some holes, and drilling progress in metres was below targets due to logistical/geological challenges. I'd like to think the RMR guy is telling Alphamin that their best route is buying us out. All speculation of course. More results by the end of this week according to the latest video",

Firstly, regarding alphamin employing the guy from Rome who is in charge of exploration, this has a double edge to it. Obviously, Alphamin are finding it difficult finding new Tin and secondly, it may be a good move for us as it would or could support an offer for Rome. Secondly, Paul Barrat stated that they would be getting a new non exec on board to replace Mark Gasson, nothing has happenned yet, I would like to know why, if they don't replace him maybe because the end game may be sooner than we think. The RNS this morning was good but there was no mention regarding Zinc oe Silver, would anyone like to say why, is it being ignored or is there another reason. With the Rout today in metals we seem to be holding up well, ther are more buys than sells but we are down 2% which is nothing, maybe there is a large background sell as the purchase price is getting weaker Regards all",

Since mid-2022 to end of 2025 is ~3.5 years, that implies roughly: 8.25 years \u2212 3.5 years \u2248 ~4.75 years remaining at that schedule level. But production has been higher (~18 500\u201320 000 t/yr), so mining depletes reserves faster: At ~18 500 t/yr, the same reserve base would be depleted sooner \u2014 roughly: \ufffd Then subtract ~3.5 years since mid-2022 gives about ~3.2 years left under that simple model.",

Whilst we should consider the positive spin it is also important to balance with the potential negative scenario. In PB's new year video he specifically referenced Jamie as a key member of the team on the ground and effectively said he had stepped up and filled some of Mark Gasson's role. He went as far as to state that Jamie was married with a family in DRC and was therefore a permanent fixture. What are the scenarios? 1) Jamie has a family and was offered more money, after all he was at Alphamin before so perhaps they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 2) He can continue to consult for RMR beyond March. 3) He knows AFM will acquire RMR in the near future anyway so he will still be working those assets. 4) He is jumping ship... Let's hope PB can provide some more detail. On the security situation - that paragraph has appeared in the last 2 operational updates so I think it is important everyone remains vigilant that despite the MSM headlines, the situation is still extremely volatile on the ground. Will update the board if I hear.",

The guy was not fully employed by RMR I don't think, he was probably part of a team that are self employed as it would make no sense keeping someone on because they don't drill all the year around. That is probably the reason why they were going to get someone to replace  Mark Gasson. The longer they take to replace Mark or Jamie the better as it shows that something is going on",

However the  recruitment of Jamie Anderson  by Alphamin can only be seen as a positive, Firstly, he is leaving once the second round of drilling is complete, secondly, as I said Alphamin have not had a material find of new Tin as far as I am aware  and Paul Barrett has already stated that once this is completed and the results are reasonable they ar going to try and do an arrangement with one or maybe two companies. I don't think there is any reason to panic",

Having read the Alphamin  report,  Jamie  Anderson going to Alphamin is a situation that must of been known at Board level and not announcing it could not be material because they have a duty to report. The security situation is again a standard comment that has to be reported which I consider not too important as again it is vital that a Company report anything that may be on the horizon. To say the two announcements are bombshells Ithink is a bit of an overstatement, yes we should know and thatks for telling us but I don't think it is as dramatic as you say. What is very important is that Alphamins latest  exploration drilling for new Tin finds show nothing has been found so far.",

Could he perform both roles? Maybe....PB needs to clarify ASAP. If not then this is a blow having lost Mark Gasson recently. Who knows if this is a positive in the long run, having someone with an intimate knowledge of Rome's prospectivity in a senior position within Alphamin, but it leaves uncertainty beyond March. 2) Alphamin highlights a deteriorating security situation which, if it progresses further, could affect mining operations. An Alphamin shut down would be catastrophic for RMR share price. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and time horizon and will make their own decisions but just wanted to make everyone aware.

I think at the moment traders are taking positions to make a quick buck as we found out when the MRE was announced.  The Company are sending out lots of interviews and messages on Linkedin etc etc but they need to show the market that they have something serious that warrants longer term investors coming in. Managing expectations has always been a problem with AIM companies however I do believe that this is a better run outfit than others and hopefully Mark Gasson will leave his family proud  and richer.",

Obviously, patience is key, the reaction to the MRE as far as I am concerned has a mixture of angles to it. Firstly, there probably were quite a few investors thinking that Bonanza grade was going to be found in the shallow drilling, or the results from the shallow drilling was not good enough. However, seeing as Alphamin found nothing on the first set of drilling results make me feel the oposite. Secondly, Traders bought in just to dump afterwards and as there was no spike in the price after the MRE they all left which resulted in a plummet. The AIM market is fickel and difficult and very high risk. Even so, I think we will strike good grades, or should I say I hope we will. Then we shall see what goes from there. There also seem to be no people who want to discuss things as there is little to say until results start coming through",

          "content": "Shreksdonkey Great name!!   Interesting post. I know that Brokers get up to all sorts of tricks to make a good return. However, from what I know, the Brokers were the ones who introduced RMR to Pathfinder and although they are a small  boutique Company, they seem to want to be in there for the longer term which to me means that shorting a small  illiquid stock seems a bit strange or at least a bit unlikely. However these Companies to me are quite flackey and not to be trusted.  I have said before that one of  the reasons that the SP fell sharply was because of the expctations of others. The main question is do you trust the management? I think they will find a healthy amount of Tin and the Copper/ Zinc is a bit of cream on the cake. The other main area to feel confident on is that if we can find up to 200k tons of Tin or 175k and open at strike both ends then it would be of great value to Alphamin, is they bought RMR it would also revalue their Company because of the reserves they have Given that they produce about 18000 tons a year, RMR would give Alphamin a great life of mines and the return for  IRH would be incredible. Her's hopeing for a good drilling campaign",

When they get over 0.30 they are probably on their way. The point I want to make is that there are so many small Companies that do not keep their shareholders in the loop as to what is going on, Jubilee metals which I was in is one of them. However if you do notify the market of things that are going on like drill results or the capability of extrcating ore from what you have some seem to comment on it like you are trying too hard.  You just can't win. I am more than happy that we are kept up to date and the style of reporting to me is not hyperbole but factual.  The board or rather Paul and Klaus would look pretty bloody stupid if what they say is there is NOT. Although I am still agravated regarding the sell of when the first set of figures came out I think and hope that this slow build up will get us to near where we should be which to me is between 0.75 and 1p after the results are out. Comments please as this seems to be a bit of a boring board for interaction",

Some follow up details from my ChatGPT info gathering, regarding Alphamin drilling progress: \ud83d\udccd 2024\u20132025 \u2013 Recent Drilling & Challenges \ud83d\udfe1 Resumed Drilling but Less Immediate Success After a hiatus, drill programmes at Mpama North and Mpama South restarted in late Q4 2024 and continued through 2025, but results have been mixed. The most recent bulletins indicate that out of a few holes drilled late in 2025, visible tin mineralisation was not observed in some holes, and drilling progress in metres was below targets due to logistical/geological challenges. I'd like to think the RMR guy is telling Alphamin that their best route is buying us out. All speculation of course. More results by the end of this week according to the latest video",

Firstly, regarding alphamin employing the guy from Rome who is in charge of exploration, this has a double edge to it. Obviously, Alphamin are finding it difficult finding new Tin and secondly, it may be a good move for us as it would or could support an offer for Rome. Secondly, Paul Barrat stated that they would be getting a new non exec on board to replace Mark Gasson, nothing has happenned yet, I would like to know why, if they don't replace him maybe because the end game may be sooner than we think. The RNS this morning was good but there was no mention regarding Zinc oe Silver, would anyone like to say why, is it being ignored or is there another reason. With the Rout today in metals we seem to be holding up well, ther are more buys than sells but we are down 2% which is nothing, maybe there is a large background sell as the purchase price is getting weaker Regards all",

Since mid-2022 to end of 2025 is ~3.5 years, that implies roughly: 8.25 years \u2212 3.5 years \u2248 ~4.75 years remaining at that schedule level. But production has been higher (~18 500\u201320 000 t/yr), so mining depletes reserves faster: At ~18 500 t/yr, the same reserve base would be depleted sooner \u2014 roughly: \ufffd Then subtract ~3.5 years since mid-2022 gives about ~3.2 years left under that simple model.",

Whilst we should consider the positive spin it is also important to balance with the potential negative scenario. In PB's new year video he specifically referenced Jamie as a key member of the team on the ground and effectively said he had stepped up and filled some of Mark Gasson's role. He went as far as to state that Jamie was married with a family in DRC and was therefore a permanent fixture. What are the scenarios? 1) Jamie has a family and was offered more money, after all he was at Alphamin before so perhaps they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 2) He can continue to consult for RMR beyond March. 3) He knows AFM will acquire RMR in the near future anyway so he will still be working those assets. 4) He is jumping ship... Let's hope PB can provide some more detail. On the security situation - that paragraph has appeared in the last 2 operational updates so I think it is important everyone remains vigilant that despite the MSM headlines, the situation is still extremely volatile on the ground. Will update the board if I hear.",

That is probably the reason why they were going to get someone to replace  Mark Gasson. The longer they take to replace Mark or Jamie the better as it shows that something is going on",

Having read the Alphamin  report,  Jamie  Anderson going to Alphamin is a situation that must of been known at Board level and not announcing it could not be material because they have a duty to report. The security situation is again a standard comment that has to be reported which I consider not too important as again it is vital that a Company report anything that may be on the horizon. To say the two announcements are bombshells Ithink is a bit of an overstatement, yes we should know and thatks for telling us but I don't think it is as dramatic as you say. What is very important is that Alphamins latest  exploration drilling for new Tin finds show nothing has been found so far.",

Could he perform both roles? Maybe....PB needs to clarify ASAP. If not then this is a blow having lost Mark Gasson recently. Who knows if this is a positive in the long run, having someone with an intimate knowledge of Rome's prospectivity in a senior position within Alphamin, but it leaves uncertainty beyond March. 2) Alphamin highlights a deteriorating security situation which, if it progresses further, could affect mining operations. An Alphamin shut down would be catastrophic for RMR share price. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and time horizon and will make their own decisions but just wanted to make everyone aware.

The Company are sending out lots of interviews and messages on Linkedin etc etc but they need to show the market that they have something serious that warrants longer term investors coming in. Managing expectations has always been a problem with AIM companies however I do believe that this is a better run outfit than others and hopefully Mark Gasson will leave his family proud  and richer.",

Obviously, patience is key, the reaction to the MRE as far as I am concerned has a mixture of angles to it. Firstly, there probably were quite a few investors thinking that Bonanza grade was going to be found in the shallow drilling, or the results from the shallow drilling was not good enough. However, seeing as Alphamin found nothing on the first set of drilling results make me feel the oposite. Secondly, Traders bought in just to dump afterwards and as there was no spike in the price after the MRE they all left which resulted in a plummet. The AIM market is fickel and difficult and very high risk. Even so, I think we will strike good grades, or should I say I hope we will. Then we shall see what goes from there. There also seem to be no people who want to discuss things as there is little to say until results start coming through",

However, from what I know, the Brokers were the ones who introduced RMR to Pathfinder and although they are a small  boutique Company, they seem to want to be in there for the longer term which to me means that shorting a small  illiquid stock seems a bit strange or at least a bit unlikely. However these Companies to me are quite flackey and not to be trusted.  I have said before that one of  the reasons that the SP fell sharply was because of the expctations of others. The main question is do you trust the management? I think they will find a healthy amount of Tin and the Copper/ Zinc is a bit of cream on the cake. The other main area to feel confident on is that if we can find up to 200k tons of Tin or 175k and open at strike both ends then it would be of great value to Alphamin, is they bought RMR it would also revalue their Company because of the reserves they have Given that they produce about 18000 tons a year, RMR would give Alphamin a great life of mines and the return for  IRH would be incredible. Her's hopeing for a good drilling campaign",

One of the main reasons for investing here was because the message was that they were going to find the Tin/Copper and sell I am sure a lot of people are like me in here because of this.  Because of the Copper/ Zinc and Silver this has slightly complicated the issue especially with Alphamin as they are only interested in Tin.  To me an offtake agreement is not the same as a sell and I hope they stick to their original plan and sell both assets (if the results are good enough) as this would produce maximum shareholdeer value. On another note there has been no news on the Pathfinder assets, if in  fact they are assets",

Rome only has  exploration permits, not fully permitted and producing mines. Also the article talks about a 5% local ownership only. Compliance on designated strategic minerals is always stronger, tin  is not considered strategic by the DRC. Companies usually structure around it like holding the DRC asset in a local Congolese subsidiary so as to isolate political & regulatory risk. For example, Alphamin\u2019s Bisie tin mine operates through a DRC-registered local company called Alphamin Bisie Mining SA (ABM). The ownership breakdown of ABM is: 84.1% owned by Alphamin (via international holding companies), 5% owned by the Government of the DRC (& 10.8% owned by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa There are far more important issues than a 5% local holding if it ever came to pass.",

When they get over 0.30 they are probably on their way. The point I want to make is that there are so many small Companies that do not keep their shareholders in the loop as to what is going on, Jubilee metals which I was in is one of them. However if you do notify the market of things that are going on like drill results or the capability of extrcating ore from what you have some seem to comment on it like you are trying too hard.  You just can't win. I am more than happy that we are kept up to date and the style of reporting to me is not hyperbole but factual.  The board or rather Paul and Klaus would look pretty bloody stupid if what they say is there is NOT. Although I am still agravated regarding the sell of when the first set of figures came out I think and hope that this slow build up will get us to near where we should be which to me is between 0.75 and 1p after the results are out. Comments please as this seems to be a bit of a boring board for interaction",

Some follow up details from my ChatGPT info gathering, regarding Alphamin drilling progress: \ud83d\udccd 2024\u20132025 \u2013 Recent Drilling & Challenges \ud83d\udfe1 Resumed Drilling but Less Immediate Success After a hiatus, drill programmes at Mpama North and Mpama South restarted in late Q4 2024 and continued through 2025, but results have been mixed. The most recent bulletins indicate that out of a few holes drilled late in 2025, visible tin mineralisation was not observed in some holes, and drilling progress in metres was below targets due to logistical/geological challenges. I'd like to think the RMR guy is telling Alphamin that their best route is buying us out. All speculation of course. More results by the end of this week according to the latest video",

Firstly, regarding alphamin employing the guy from Rome who is in charge of exploration, this has a double edge to it. Obviously, Alphamin are finding it difficult finding new Tin and secondly, it may be a good move for us as it would or could support an offer for Rome. Secondly, Paul Barrat stated that they would be getting a new non exec on board to replace Mark Gasson, nothing has happenned yet, I would like to know why, if they don't replace him maybe because the end game may be sooner than we think. The RNS this morning was good but there was no mention regarding Zinc oe Silver, would anyone like to say why, is it being ignored or is there another reason. With the Rout today in metals we seem to be holding up well, ther are more buys than sells but we are down 2% which is nothing, maybe there is a large background sell as the purchase price is getting weaker Regards all",

Since mid-2022 to end of 2025 is ~3.5 years, that implies roughly: 8.25 years \u2212 3.5 years \u2248 ~4.75 years remaining at that schedule level. But production has been higher (~18 500\u201320 000 t/yr), so mining depletes reserves faster: At ~18 500 t/yr, the same reserve base would be depleted sooner \u2014 roughly: \ufffd Then subtract ~3.5 years since mid-2022 gives about ~3.2 years left under that simple model.",

          "content": "@make5mil - hopefully! @edzi - I have contacted Paul and Klaus to seek clarification on the Jamie Anderson situation. Whilst we should consider the positive spin it is also important to balance with the potential negative scenario. In PB's new year video he specifically referenced Jamie as a key member of the team on the ground and effectively said he had stepped up and filled some of Mark Gasson's role. He went as far as to state that Jamie was married with a family in DRC and was therefore a permanent fixture. What are the scenarios? 1) Jamie has a family and was offered more money, after all he was at Alphamin before so perhaps they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 2) He can continue to consult for RMR beyond March. 3) He knows AFM will acquire RMR in the near future anyway so he will still be working those assets. 4) He is jumping ship... Let's hope PB can provide some more detail. On the security situation - that paragraph has appeared in the last 2 operational updates so I think it is important everyone remains vigilant that despite the MSM headlines, the situation is still extremely volatile on the ground. Will update the board if I hear.",

That is probably the reason why they were going to get someone to replace  Mark Gasson. The longer they take to replace Mark or Jamie the better as it shows that something is going on",

Having read the Alphamin  report,  Jamie  Anderson going to Alphamin is a situation that must of been known at Board level and not announcing it could not be material because they have a duty to report. The security situation is again a standard comment that has to be reported which I consider not too important as again it is vital that a Company report anything that may be on the horizon. To say the two announcements are bombshells Ithink is a bit of an overstatement, yes we should know and thatks for telling us but I don't think it is as dramatic as you say. What is very important is that Alphamins latest  exploration drilling for new Tin finds show nothing has been found so far.",

Could he perform both roles? Maybe....PB needs to clarify ASAP. If not then this is a blow having lost Mark Gasson recently. Who knows if this is a positive in the long run, having someone with an intimate knowledge of Rome's prospectivity in a senior position within Alphamin, but it leaves uncertainty beyond March. 2) Alphamin highlights a deteriorating security situation which, if it progresses further, could affect mining operations. An Alphamin shut down would be catastrophic for RMR share price. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and time horizon and will make their own decisions but just wanted to make everyone aware.

I think at the moment traders are taking positions to make a quick buck as we found out when the MRE was announced.  The Company are sending out lots of interviews and messages on Linkedin etc etc but they need to show the market that they have something serious that warrants longer term investors coming in. Managing expectations has always been a problem with AIM companies however I do believe that this is a better run outfit than others and hopefully Mark Gasson will leave his family proud  and richer.",

Obviously, patience is key, the reaction to the MRE as far as I am concerned has a mixture of angles to it. Firstly, there probably were quite a few investors thinking that Bonanza grade was going to be found in the shallow drilling, or the results from the shallow drilling was not good enough. However, seeing as Alphamin found nothing on the first set of drilling results make me feel the oposite. Secondly, Traders bought in just to dump afterwards and as there was no spike in the price after the MRE they all left which resulted in a plummet. The AIM market is fickel and difficult and very high risk. Even so, I think we will strike good grades, or should I say I hope we will. Then we shall see what goes from there. There also seem to be no people who want to discuss things as there is little to say until results start coming through",

However, from what I know, the Brokers were the ones who introduced RMR to Pathfinder and although they are a small  boutique Company, they seem to want to be in there for the longer term which to me means that shorting a small  illiquid stock seems a bit strange or at least a bit unlikely. However these Companies to me are quite flackey and not to be trusted.  I have said before that one of  the reasons that the SP fell sharply was because of the expctations of others. The main question is do you trust the management? I think they will find a healthy amount of Tin and the Copper/ Zinc is a bit of cream on the cake. The other main area to feel confident on is that if we can find up to 200k tons of Tin or 175k and open at strike both ends then it would be of great value to Alphamin, is they bought RMR it would also revalue their Company because of the reserves they have Given that they produce about 18000 tons a year, RMR would give Alphamin a great life of mines and the return for  IRH would be incredible. Her's hopeing for a good drilling campaign",

When they get over 0.30 they are probably on their way. The point I want to make is that there are so many small Companies that do not keep their shareholders in the loop as to what is going on, Jubilee metals which I was in is one of them. However if you do notify the market of things that are going on like drill results or the capability of extrcating ore from what you have some seem to comment on it like you are trying too hard.  You just can't win. I am more than happy that we are kept up to date and the style of reporting to me is not hyperbole but factual.  The board or rather Paul and Klaus would look pretty bloody stupid if what they say is there is NOT. Although I am still agravated regarding the sell of when the first set of figures came out I think and hope that this slow build up will get us to near where we should be which to me is between 0.75 and 1p after the results are out. Comments please as this seems to be a bit of a boring board for interaction",

The most recent bulletins indicate that out of a few holes drilled late in 2025, visible tin mineralisation was not observed in some holes, and drilling progress in metres was below targets due to logistical/geological challenges. I'd like to think the RMR guy is telling Alphamin that their best route is buying us out. All speculation of course. More results by the end of this week according to the latest video",

Firstly, regarding alphamin employing the guy from Rome who is in charge of exploration, this has a double edge to it. Obviously, Alphamin are finding it difficult finding new Tin and secondly, it may be a good move for us as it would or could support an offer for Rome. Secondly, Paul Barrat stated that they would be getting a new non exec on board to replace Mark Gasson, nothing has happenned yet, I would like to know why, if they don't replace him maybe because the end game may be sooner than we think. The RNS this morning was good but there was no mention regarding Zinc oe Silver, would anyone like to say why, is it being ignored or is there another reason. With the Rout today in metals we seem to be holding up well, ther are more buys than sells but we are down 2% which is nothing, maybe there is a large background sell as the purchase price is getting weaker Regards all",

Since mid-2022 to end of 2025 is ~3.5 years, that implies roughly: 8.25 years \u2212 3.5 years \u2248 ~4.75 years remaining at that schedule level. But production has been higher (~18 500\u201320 000 t/yr), so mining depletes reserves faster: At ~18 500 t/yr, the same reserve base would be depleted sooner \u2014 roughly: \ufffd Then subtract ~3.5 years since mid-2022 gives about ~3.2 years left under that simple model.",

Whilst we should consider the positive spin it is also important to balance with the potential negative scenario. In PB's new year video he specifically referenced Jamie as a key member of the team on the ground and effectively said he had stepped up and filled some of Mark Gasson's role. He went as far as to state that Jamie was married with a family in DRC and was therefore a permanent fixture. What are the scenarios? 1) Jamie has a family and was offered more money, after all he was at Alphamin before so perhaps they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 2) He can continue to consult for RMR beyond March. 3) He knows AFM will acquire RMR in the near future anyway so he will still be working those assets. 4) He is jumping ship... Let's hope PB can provide some more detail. On the security situation - that paragraph has appeared in the last 2 operational updates so I think it is important everyone remains vigilant that despite the MSM headlines, the situation is still extremely volatile on the ground. Will update the board if I hear.",

The guy was not fully employed by RMR I don't think, he was probably part of a team that are self employed as it would make no sense keeping someone on because they don't drill all the year around. That is probably the reason why they were going to get someone to replace  Mark Gasson. The longer they take to replace Mark or Jamie the better as it shows that something is going on",

However the  recruitment of Jamie Anderson  by Alphamin can only be seen as a positive, Firstly, he is leaving once the second round of drilling is complete, secondly, as I said Alphamin have not had a material find of new Tin as far as I am aware  and Paul Barrett has already stated that once this is completed and the results are reasonable they ar going to try and do an arrangement with one or maybe two companies. I don't think there is any reason to panic",

Having read the Alphamin  report,  Jamie  Anderson going to Alphamin is a situation that must of been known at Board level and not announcing it could not be material because they have a duty to report. The security situation is again a standard comment that has to be reported which I consider not too important as again it is vital that a Company report anything that may be on the horizon. To say the two announcements are bombshells Ithink is a bit of an overstatement, yes we should know and thatks for telling us but I don't think it is as dramatic as you say. What is very important is that Alphamins latest  exploration drilling for new Tin finds show nothing has been found so far.",

Could he perform both roles? Maybe....PB needs to clarify ASAP. If not then this is a blow having lost Mark Gasson recently. Who knows if this is a positive in the long run, having someone with an intimate knowledge of Rome's prospectivity in a senior position within Alphamin, but it leaves uncertainty beyond March. 2) Alphamin highlights a deteriorating security situation which, if it progresses further, could affect mining operations. An Alphamin shut down would be catastrophic for RMR share price. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and time horizon and will make their own decisions but just wanted to make everyone aware.

I think at the moment traders are taking positions to make a quick buck as we found out when the MRE was announced.  The Company are sending out lots of interviews and messages on Linkedin etc etc but they need to show the market that they have something serious that warrants longer term investors coming in. Managing expectations has always been a problem with AIM companies however I do believe that this is a better run outfit than others and hopefully Mark Gasson will leave his family proud  and richer.",

Obviously, patience is key, the reaction to the MRE as far as I am concerned has a mixture of angles to it. Firstly, there probably were quite a few investors thinking that Bonanza grade was going to be found in the shallow drilling, or the results from the shallow drilling was not good enough. However, seeing as Alphamin found nothing on the first set of drilling results make me feel the oposite. Secondly, Traders bought in just to dump afterwards and as there was no spike in the price after the MRE they all left which resulted in a plummet. The AIM market is fickel and difficult and very high risk. Even so, I think we will strike good grades, or should I say I hope we will. Then we shall see what goes from there. There also seem to be no people who want to discuss things as there is little to say until results start coming through",

          "content": "Shreksdonkey Great name!!   Interesting post. I know that Brokers get up to all sorts of tricks to make a good return. However, from what I know, the Brokers were the ones who introduced RMR to Pathfinder and although they are a small  boutique Company, they seem to want to be in there for the longer term which to me means that shorting a small  illiquid stock seems a bit strange or at least a bit unlikely. However these Companies to me are quite flackey and not to be trusted.  I have said before that one of  the reasons that the SP fell sharply was because of the expctations of others. The main question is do you trust the management? I think they will find a healthy amount of Tin and the Copper/ Zinc is a bit of cream on the cake. The other main area to feel confident on is that if we can find up to 200k tons of Tin or 175k and open at strike both ends then it would be of great value to Alphamin, is they bought RMR it would also revalue their Company because of the reserves they have Given that they produce about 18000 tons a year, RMR would give Alphamin a great life of mines and the return for  IRH would be incredible. Her's hopeing for a good drilling campaign",
