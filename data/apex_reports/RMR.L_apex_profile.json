This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post maiden MRE drilling programme, with drilling at Kalayi continuing to demonstrate that near-surface high-grade tin mineralisation continues at depth.\nFour new drillholes have completed (five in total at Kalayi), with a further hole approaching its target depth. Initial on-site portable handheld XRF readings summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillholes KBDD020 to KBDD023 with average grades of mineralisation and depths tested:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD023 encountered\n2m @ 8.30% tin\nfrom 74 metres depth and\n5m @ 0.48% tin\nfrom 86 metres.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD021 encountered\n2m @ 2.23% tin\nfrom 181 metres depth and\n2m @ 2.33% copper\nfrom 107 metres.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD022 encountered 1m @ 1.89% tin at 54 metres depth, 1m @ 1.35% tin at 68 metres depth and 1m @ 0.34% tin at 72m.\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD020 was abandoned at 40.5 metres and redrilled to a depth of 135.0 metres, without encountering significant tin mineralisation.\nFigure 1:\nDrill core showing visible cassiterite (brown) within a broader ~2.0 m mineralised interval, with portable handheld XRF readings indicating an average grade of ~8.3% Sn.\nThe handheld XRF used at Bisie North is a Thermo Scientific NitonTM XL3t model. Readings represent averages of 60 second continuous analysis along 1m sections of core. The X-ray beam is emitted through an 8mm window and penetrates up to several millimetres into the drill core. The metal grades determined by the portable handheld XRF are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for resource estimation. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay, with results to be reported in due course.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\nUp to four further drill holes (including the current hole) are planned on Kalayi to continue testing the down-plunge extent of tin mineralisation, after which drilling will resume at Mont Agoma where the Company is targeting deeper tin-rich zones beneath the established polymetallic system.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We continue to be encouraged by this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is considered consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation. These results further support our view that Kalayi hosts high-grade tin shoots that persist below the depths tested to date.\nDrilling will move to Mont Agoma in the coming weeks. We look forward to regularly updating the market as drilling continues on both prospects and further results become available.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/rAk8wy\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDr. Paul Armitage is a consultant of Rome Resources plc, a qualified geologist, a Fellow of the London Geological Society and a Member of the\nInstitute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\n.

This update follows the drilling update provided on 16 January 2026.\nMetallurgical testing was undertaken by SGS on bulk samples from the tin, copper and zinc zones in order to assess the potential for commercial recovery of the various commodity metals from the ore. The results for copper and tin recovery are encouraging.\n\u00b7\nThe tin zone sample has responded well to gravity pre-concentration with 80% of the Sn reporting to a first concentrate at a grade of over 10% Sn from a head grade of 0.6% Sn in less than 5% of the mass.\n\u00b7\nThe copper zone sample has also responded well to gravity pre-concentration with 96% of the Cu reporting to a concentrate at a grade of 3.7% Cu from a head grade of 2.4% Cu in less than 63% of the mass.\n\u00b7\nThe copper sample responded very well to flotation with 95.5% of the Cu reporting to the rougher flotation at a grade of 9.5% Cu. The Zn in this sample followed the Cu and differential flotation may therefore be considered to separate the Cu and Zn.\nIn all cases customary cleaning of the tin and copper concentrates will be required in order to raise the grade to export levels.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, said:\n\"These preliminary results are highly encouraging for the potential commercialisation of both the tin and copper at Bisie North. As the copper is developed at shallow depths in the Mont Agoma deposit, recovery and monetisation of this is expected to be highly accretive to the overall project economics.\nCurrently, the drilling campaign at Kalayi continues and we will move to Mont Agoma next month to test further the extent of the tin and copper mineralisation.

This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post-maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") drilling programme, details of which were announced on 23 December 2025. The maiden MRE confirmed that the target zones are part of a large polymetallic system, with Mont Agoma demonstrating a wide zone dominated by near-surface copper with tin grade anticipated to increase at depth, and Kalayi showing near-surface high-grade tin, open at depth and expected to increase in width and grade with depth.\nTwo holes have been completed, and a third hole is approaching its target depth. Initial findings are summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillhole KBD019:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD019 was drilled to a total depth of 189.5 metres, having encountered significant tin mineralisation between 129 metres and 135 metres.\n\u00b7\nHandheld XRF readings at 1-metre intervals across this\n6-metre-wide zone average 1.6% tin\n(six readings ranging 0.02% to 3.94% including four readings above 1.4%)\n.\n\u00b7\nThis interval is within a\nbroader 26-metre-wide zone\nshowing disseminated cassiterite between 114.0 metres and 140.7 metres depth, supporting the continuity of mineralisation at Kalayi.\n\u00b7\nThe drilling rig has since moved with drilling commenced at hole KBD020.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD034 was drilled to 94 metres, serving as a control point for the structural model.\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD035, drilled from the same pad location, is currently at approximately 190 metres depth and progressing within the main Mont Agoma mineralised zone.\nSampling and Assays\nThe reported tin grades are derived from handheld XRF analyses. These are spot readings with an approximately 10-millimetre-wide analytical window and are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for any resource calculations. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay in due course, with results to be reported once received.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We are encouraged by the early indications from this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation.\n\"Drilling at Mont Agoma is also progressing well as we move toward the deeper parts of the system where we believe tin grades may strengthen.
