This drilling activity forms part of the Company's post-maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") drilling programme, details of which were announced on 23 December 2025. The maiden MRE confirmed that the target zones are part of a large polymetallic system, with Mont Agoma demonstrating a wide zone dominated by near-surface copper with tin grade anticipated to increase at depth, and Kalayi showing near-surface high-grade tin, open at depth and expected to increase in width and grade with depth.\nTwo holes have been completed, and a third hole is approaching its target depth. Initial findings are summarised below.\nInitial on-site results from drillhole KBD019:\n\u00b7\nKalayi hole KBD019 was drilled to a total depth of 189.5 metres, having encountered significant tin mineralisation between 129 metres and 135 metres.\n\u00b7\nHandheld XRF readings at 1-metre intervals across this\n6-metre-wide zone average 1.6% tin\n(six readings ranging 0.02% to 3.94% including four readings above 1.4%)\n.\n\u00b7\nThis interval is within a\nbroader 26-metre-wide zone\nshowing disseminated cassiterite between 114.0 metres and 140.7 metres depth, supporting the continuity of mineralisation at Kalayi.\n\u00b7\nThe drilling rig has since moved with drilling commenced at hole KBD020.\nMont Agoma drilling update:\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD034 was drilled to 94 metres, serving as a control point for the structural model.\n\u00b7\nDrillhole MADD035, drilled from the same pad location, is currently at approximately 190 metres depth and progressing within the main Mont Agoma mineralised zone.\nSampling and Assays\nThe reported tin grades are derived from handheld XRF analyses. These are spot readings with an approximately 10-millimetre-wide analytical window and are indicative only. They should not be relied upon for any resource calculations. Samples from completed drillholes will be submitted for laboratory assay in due course, with results to be reported once received.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, commented:\n\"We are encouraged by the early indications from this second phase of drilling at Kalayi, where the intersection of a tin-rich zone at depth is consistent with the Company's structural model and expectations for high-grade extensions beneath the known mineralisation.\n\"Drilling at Mont Agoma is also progressing well as we move toward the deeper parts of the system where we believe tin grades may strengthen. We look forward to regularly updating the market as drilling continues on both prospects and further results become available.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/rAk8wy\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDr. Paul Armitage is a consultant of Rome Resources plc, a qualified geologist, a Fellow of the London Geological Society and a Member of the\nInstitute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\n.

This campaign is aimed at testing deeper mineralisation beneath areas defined by the announced maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\"). The helicopter, drilling crew and required equipment is now on-site, with initial drilling underway at the Mont Agoma prospect using two drill rigs. This is expected to be followed by the drill rigs moving the short distance to the Kalayi prospect.\nKey elements of the forward drilling campaign include:\n\u00b7\nTargeting a number of key exploration targets, with an aggregate in-house estimate of between 53 and 144 kt of potential contained tin across both prospects.\n\u00b7\nAt Mont Agoma, drilling will target two main areas:\no\nExtending the strike of the Mont Agoma East zone; and\no\nTesting grades in the deeper Mont Agoma Western zone, where strong copper grades are anticipated to give way to higher tin grades at depth.\n\u00b7\nAt Kalayi, drilling will target extensions beneath existing high grade tin intercepts with the expectation, consistent with Alphamin's Bisie Mpama Mine results, that the thinner high-grade intercepts may widen at depth while retaining a high grade.\n\u00b7\nA total of approximately 2,000 metres of drilling is planned across 6 to 8 holes, with the programme anticipated to complete towards the end of the first quarter of 2026.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the receipt of core assays, the Company intends to update the MRE to incorporate additional intercepts from this drilling campaign.\nExploratory discussions continue with a number of parties active in the region to assess potential strategic pathways for value creation following the proposed publication of an updated MRE.\n2025 Operational Review\nFollowing the Company's admission to trading on AIM in July 2024 and the strategic investment by Stanvic Mining, Rome Resources completed a diamond drilling campaign across the Bisie North Project. A total of 5,143 metres of drill core were recovered from the Kalayi and Mont Agoma Prospects in that campaign.\nThis campaign focused on defining tin mineralisation at Kalayi and understanding the structure within the approximately 200-metre-wide polymetallic system at Mont Agoma. Resulting tin, copper, zinc and silver assays were incorporated into the Company's geological model and the maiden MRE, prepared by The MSA Group (Pty) Ltd.\nThe maiden MRE, derived from\u00a0shallow drilling over a limited portion of the licence area, delivered the following tonnages, and provides a robust foundation for testing significantly greater potential at depth:\nMont Agoma\n3.16Mt\nat 1.45% Cu, 0.16% Sn, 2.72% Zn and 14.3 g/t Ag\nKalayi\n0.33Mt\nat 1.36% Sn\nDrilling to date has generally extended to only\u00a0~220-250 metres depth\u00a0and across a relatively small fraction of the prospective licence area, leaving substantial scope for further discovery both at depth and along strike.\nA new near-surface tin zone, Mont Agoma East, intersected in one of the final holes of the 2025 campaign, was not included in the maiden MRE as it formed a single data point but now represents a promising and priority target within the current drilling campaign.\nDuring the year, metallurgical work was also commissioned to assess processing routes to economically recover the significant copper resource sitting above the tin zones at Mont Agoma. Phase one of this work is nearing completion, with results expected in due course.\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of Rome Resources, said:\n\"2025 has been a very active year, culminating in the publication of our first Mineral Resource Estimate, which confirmed Bisie North as a large, multi-metallic system. Importantly, the maiden MRE highlights how little of the system has been tested to date and where the key opportunities lie as we move deeper.\nWe are now embarking on the next phase of drilling at Mont Agoma and Kalayi with a focus on testing deeper intercepts where we believe there is potential for higher tin grades to emerge, consistent with regional analogues.\nWe were deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Mark Gasson last month. However, he would have been pleased to know that our dedicated and experienced in-country team has ensured continuity of operations.\nShareholder value growth remains the core objective of the business and our approach to this is to maximise the share of investor funds going into the ground. We look forward to building on the progress made in 2025 and advancing the Bisie North project through 2026.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions\non this announcement via our investor hub\nhttps://romeresources.com/link/PBJ17P\nRome Resources Plc\nPaul Barrett, Chief Executive Officer\nTel. +44 (0)20 3143 6748\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nTel. +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nJerry Keen, Head of Corporate Broking\nHenry Clarke, Head of Sales\nTel. +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nGordon Poole / Sam Morris\nTel. +44 (0)20 3757 4980\nSubscribe to our news alert service:\nhttps://romeresources.com/auth/signup\nQualified Person Statement\nDr Deon Vermaakt is a consultant of Rome Resources plc, a qualified geologist and a registered Professional Natural Scientist (Geological Science) with the South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions (SACNASP Reg.
