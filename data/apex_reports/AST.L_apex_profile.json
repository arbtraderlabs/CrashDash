By partnering with an experienced lithium-focused developer in Neometals and a well-resourced local partner in Omaha Value, Ascent can unlock additional value from its existing asset base at minimal cost and dilution to shareholders.\nNext steps\nNMT/OMA will now undertake technical, legal and commercial due diligence during the 60-day exclusivity period. The Company will update the market on material developments as appropriate.\nThere is no certainty that the option will be exercised or that binding definitive agreements will be entered into.\nEnquiries\nAscent Resources plc\nJean-Michel Doublet\ninfo3@ascentresources.co.uk\nZeus, Nominated Adviser & Broker\nJames Joyce / James Bavister\n0203 829 5000\nNovum Securities, Joint Broker\nJon Belliss / Colin Rowbury\n0207 399 9400\nFortified Securities, Joint-Broker\nGuy Wheatley\n0203 411 7773\nShard Capital Partners LLP, Joint-Broker\nDamon Heath\n0207 186 9952\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n7 October 2025\nAscent Resources plc\n(\"Ascent\" or the \"Company\")\nUpdate on disputes arising out of Slovenian Joint Venture\nAscent Resources Plc (LON: AST), the onshore US focused oil and gas company, is pleased to update investors in relation to the Company's ongoing domestic disputes arising out of the insolvency of the Company's former Slovenian joint venture partner, Geoenergo d.o.o.\nAs previously announced on 3 July 2025, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Ascent Slovenia Limited (\"ASL\")\nreceived a binding domestic arbitration award confirming its entitlement to an increased amount totalling approximately \u20ac7.8 million in hydrocarbon production proceeds owed to ASL by Geoenergo from historic production prior to Geoenergo entering insolvency in January 2024. ASL has now filed a court application to make the award enforceable. This filing includes a request for the Administrator to immediately pay \u20ac56,825, as specified in the Tribunal's decision, which is expected to be paid in full ahead of completion of the insolvency process. Recovery of the c. \u20ac7.8 million plus other ancillary amounts owed remains subject to the conclusion of Geoenergo's administration and consequently ASL may ultimately recover less than the full amount.\nFollowing Geoenergo's insolvency, ASL has been defending (on behalf of the joint venture) a claim by Petrol Geo d.o.o.\n(a connected party to Geoenergo by virtue of their common, significant and controlling shareholder Petrol d.o.o.)\nunder the Service Agreement (\"SA\") for approximately \u20ac440,000 of claimed invoices covering March 2023 to April 2024, alleged to be unpaid by the joint venture. The Tribunal agreed with ASL and found that it had no valid jurisdiction over amounts claimed up to 28 November 2023 and determined that Petrol Geo is owed approximately \u20ac240,000 for the period 29 November 2023 to 19 April 2024. While the Company is surprised that the Tribunal asserted jurisdiction for the period after 19 January 2024-the date on which the administrator was appointed and unilaterally terminated the joint venture and which consequently caused the SA to terminate at the same time-ASL is exploring a possibility of filing an additional (post-insolvency) claim against its former JV partner, Geoenergo d.o.o., for ASL's share of hydrocarbon proceeds produced during 20 January 2024 to 19 April 2024 (the date the concession contract was terminated). Ascent calculates these amounts to be approximately \u20ac420,000 and such amounts should be payable in full from cash currently held on account by the administrator, which stood at approximately \u20ac1.633 million as of 30 June 2025.\nIn parallel, ASL initiated mediation against Petrol Geo under the Framework Build Operate Transfer Agreement (FBOTA) seeking reimbursement of approximately \u20ac66,000 in prepaid easement costs-benefits ASL will no longer receive and which have unjustly enriched Petrol Geo-and to require Petrol Geo to meet its contractual obligation under the FBOTA to acquire ASL's 75% interests in plant and infrastructure acquired by the joint venture after October 2013. The parties are in direct discussions exploring an amicable, holistic solution to these interrelated matters. ASL remains focused on a pragmatic outcome, which could include ASL's exit from any remaining interests in plant and property in Slovenia; however, there is no certainty that agreement will be reached. Further updates will be provided as appropriate.\nEnquiries\nAscent Resources plc\nJean-Michel Doublet\ninfo3@ascentresources.co.uk\nZeus, Nominated Adviser & Broker\nJames Joyce / James Bavister\n0203 829 5000\nFortified Securities, Joint-Broker\nGuy Wheatley\n0203 411 7773\nShard Capital Partners LLP, Joint-Broker\nDamon Heath\n0207 186 9952\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Key highlights for the first half of the year include:\n- Completion of shareholder distribution with ring-fenced access to 41% of the net proceeds received in relation to a positive outcome of the Company's significant Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") damages claim;\n- Conclusion of the hearing on merits and quantum in relation to the Company's significant ECT damages claim against the Republic of Slovenia;\n- Expansion of the Company's footprint in the United States of America and significant increase in exposure to proven reserves with acquisitions of interests in oil and gas with helium leases owned and operated by ARB Energy Utah LLC in Utah and leases owned and operated by Locin Oil Corporation in Colorado;\n- Positive decision received in Ascent's favour relating to long standing dispute with Geoenergo D.o.o. (in administration) relating to amounts Ascent is owed from historic production but which Geoenergo refused to previously pay to Ascent; and\n- Board changes initiated, reprofiling of senior secured debt, implemented G&A cash cost reduction exercise and new funding secured.\nShareholder Distribution\nThe first half of 2025 has seen the Company implement a shareholder distribution with rights to redeemable A2 Preference Shares which enfranchises the holder to receive their relevant pro rata portion of 41% of the net economic proceeds which may be realised in the Company's significant and well-advanced ECT damages claim against the Republic of Slovenia (\"ROS\"). The Company still retains 100% ownership and decision-making control in relation to the claim and retains a direct 10% economic interest in the net amounts received in the event of a successful claim and payment of damages award. This distribution was completed following engagement with shareholders and to enfranchise those that held the Company's shares on the record date with a ring-fenced access to a further portion of the proceeds to be received in the event of a positive claim outcome, that would not be diluted in the event of any future changes in the Company's issued share capital.\nECT Claim Progress\nThe ECT claim has continued to proceed in accordance with the timetable previously agreed at the opening of the arbitration proceedings. Notably during H1 2025, the Company and its lawyers attended the hearing on merits and quantum which was scheduled over five days in April this year and held in Paris. After the period under review both parties have submitted their respective post hearing briefs and\nthe Company has been notified by the Arbitration Tribunal that no further submissions are required in the proceedings. In accordance with the 2022 ICSID Convention Arbitration Rules, a tribunal must aim to render its award within 240 days after the last submission in the proceedings. The Company therefore expects to receive the Arbitration Tribunal's award on merits towards the end of Q1 2026\n. It should be cautioned that in the event the Company is successful in its claim any amount received by the Company may be significantly lower than the amount claimed\n.\nUpdate on GNG Partners LLC Lisbon Valley gas processing plant investment and 49% interest in American Helium LLC operated oil and gas with helium leases in Utah and Colorado\nFurther to the Company's investment in GNG Partners LLC (\"GNG\") (the owners of the Lisbon valley natural gas and helium processing plant in Utah - as announced in April 2024) and the acquisition of a 49% interest in oil and gas leases operated by American Helium LLC in Utah and Colorado, the Company is pleased to update shareholders that post period under review GNG have signed a non-binding term sheet for an investment from a strategic investor which is expected to provide sufficient funding for GNG to complete the recommissioning and further enable the development of the 60 mmscfpd nameplate Lisbon Valley natural gas and helium processing plant in Utah, which was shut-in at the beginning of the year for maintenance and repair works. Subject to the closing of the proposed financing, the Plant is now expected to be back on line and processing gas from upstream producers by the calendar year end with the helium purification unit expected to be back online and purifying a five \"9s\" (99.999%) gaseous helium by that time and with the 550 mscfpd helium liquefier now expected to be recommissioned in H1 2026.\nAs a result of the indicated investment into and subsequent resumption of gas processing operations, Ascent and American Helium are positioned to resume production from their existing well bores which are already connected to the GNG gas gathering transmission system, and which were producing circa 3.2 mmscfpd gross to the JOA partners interests through H2 2024, prior to being shut-in alongside the GNG plant earlier this year. The resumption of gas processing activities by GNG and resumption of gas production from the American Helium operated leases in Utah and Colorado will be a landmark event for the Company and we look forward to updating shareholders on progress through this exciting recommissioning and initial ramp up phase.\nExpansion of entry into U.S. Onshore Oil and Natural Gas and Helium Sector\nConsistent with the Company's prior move in 2024 into U.S. onshore oil, natural gas and helium markets, the Company announced in May 2025 a fundraising of \u00a31.35 million combine with\n-\nthe acquisition of a 49% direct interest in over 100,000 acres of oil and gas leases in Colorado owned and operated by Locin Oil Corporation for a total consideration of US$2.5 million;\n-\nan initial acquisition of a 10% interest in 80,000 acres of leases owned and operated by ARB Energy LLC in Utah for a consideration of US$750,000; and\n-\nchanges to its Board including the decision by Andrew Dennan not to stand for re-election as Director at the Company's upcoming AGM, following which he retired as Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. After completion of customary on-boarding checks, the Company, post period under review, appointed David Patterson, a seasoned U.S. onshore oil and gas veteran with over 43 years of experience in oil and gas exploration and production as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company.\nThese acquisitions are consistent with the Company's strategy to grow onshore U.S. focused portfolios which have proved producing reserves and significant prospective upside in up-dip, step-out, and well deepening opportunities, to target natural gas reservoirs in formations that tested high helium concentrations such as Leadville, McCracken and Entrada formations.\nAccordingly, the Company entered into an agreement and joint operating agreement (\"JOA\") to acquire a 10% direct non-operated interest in oil and gas leases owned and operated by ARB Energy Utah, LLC (\"ARB\") which includes a portfolio of approx. 80,000 acres of oil and gas and helium rich leases in Northern Utah. The Company acquired these interests for a total consideration of US$750,000 which was satisfied with the issue of new shares at the same price as the capital raise completed in May 2025 (as set out further below) such that ARB received 111,940,299 new shares in the Company. Additionally, the Company has secured a 50% economic interest in the incremental production generated from existing well bores where the Company invests in 100% of the capital needed to implement low-cost work programs to install artificial lift technologies aimed at enhancing immediate production. The Company also has the right to have a 50% direct interest in leases where the JOA partners drill a new well in the future, as well as the option to acquire a further 23% direct interest in the leases by paying a cash consideration of US$1.5 million on or before 15 October 2025. As part of this transaction, the Company has also agreed to issue to Mr Humberto Sirvent, CEO of ARB Energy with 18,656,716 warrants exercisable at 1.0 pence per share over 3 years.\nThe ARB portfolio has Proved Reserves (PDP plus PDNP) of 8.9 Bcf of natural gas net to the JOA partners (APN Energy Consultants LLC Appraisal of Reserves Report dated 1 June 2024 prepared using the standard petroleum engineering practices in conformity with the SPE Petroleum resources Management System guidelines). The leases have 147 well bores, of which 110 are currently producing. The average aggregate daily production rate from these wells in 2024 was approx. 2.3mmscfpd which resulted in net earnings of US$496,134.\nARB has tested the gas composition of many of the existing wells and identified up to 0.54% helium content in the producing gas streams. The leases have multiple potential upsides in up-dip and on-trend step-out prospects which ARB has estimated to have Proved Undeveloped Reserves of 44 Bcf, Probable Reserves of a further 23 Bcf and Prospective Resources of an additional 109 Bcf of natural gas with potentially 1.3 Bcf of helium included as well. At the time of signature of the transaction documents, the JOA partners agreed to jointly evaluate the prospect inventory with a view to high grading the opportunity set which is work that is currently on-going and expected to be finalised in the second half of 2025. In these evaluations the partners are evaluating targets in the Entrada formation which has a high helium content association of up-to 1% contained within the produceable natural gas and condensate volumes.\nShortly after announcing the transaction, towards the end of June, the Company and ARB initiated workover operations focusing on the Wolf Point acreage in Utah where they had identified potential to connect 4 shut-in wells to a low-pressure gas transmission system and put them back into production. This operation was implemented and the initial four previously shut-in wells were brought back into production in July with initial production rates significantly higher than expected and have continued to produce since July with a stabilised flow rate of approx. 350 mmcfpd. Subsequent to these successful operations, a further four wells were targeted with workover operations.\nAt the same time as the ARB acquisition described above, the Company also entered into an agreement and joint operating agreement (\"JOA\") to acquire a direct non-operated interest in 49% of the oil and gas leases owned and operated by Locin Oil Corporation (\"Locin\") which includes a portfolio spanning more than 100,000 acres of oil and gas and helium rich leases in western Colorado. Ascent agreed to acquire this interest for a total consideration of US$2.5 million which was satisfied with the issue of new shares in Ascent at the placing price for an aggregate value of US$600,000 (as set out further below) such that Locin received 89,552,239 new shares in the Company and the issue by Ascent to Locin of a vendor note for an amount of US$1.9 million which has a 3-year term and can be converted into shares in Ascent at a conversion price of 1.0 pence per share (being a 100% premium to the price of the placing completed in May 2025) and accruing interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears after the one year anniversary of issue (\"Vendor Note\"). The issue of the Vendor Note was to facilitate the Company's acquisition of 49% interest in the oil and gas leases owned by Locin without Locin and its affiliates holding more than 29.9% of the Company's enlarged share capital at any time. Accordingly, the conversion rights under the Vendor Note can only be exercised in the event they do not cause Locin and/or its concert party to hold more than 29.9% of the enlarged share capital.\nLocin's asset position in Colorado is a portfolio of oil and gas leases which has Proved Reserves (PDP plus PDNP) of 8.06 Bcf of natural gas net to the JOA partners (APN Energy Consultants LLC Appraisal of Reserves and Revenues report dated 1 June 2024 prepared using the standard petroleum engineering practices in conformity with the SPE Petroleum resources Management System guidelines). The leases have 333 well bores, of which approximately 115 wells are currently producing, having averaged daily production rates of approx. 2mmscfpd throughout 2024 and generated net earnings of US$535,798. Additionally, there is a further ~3mmscfd of currently shut-in production pending the relocation of a third party's gas processing plant. The Company and Locin believe that such gas assets, (i) with proved production, (ii) adjacent to existing infrastructure and (iii) located in cool environments, are well suited for development of wellhead AI data centres and intend to evaluate partnerships to commercialise gas via collaboration and strategic alignment with AI data centre developers.\nLocin has tested the gas composition of several of the existing wells and has identified up-to 1.2% helium concentration in the producing gas streams. Also, Locin has identified several material prospects into target structures which have previously tested or produced gas in the 1960's and 70's as well as on-trend step-out prospects estimated by Locin to have gross Prospective Resources of an additional 663 Bcf of natural gas and potentially up to 5.3 Bcf of helium. Ascent and Locin have agreed to jointly evaluate the prospect inventory with a view to high grading the opportunity set over the coming months. In these evaluations, partners expect to target the Entrada producing formation which has a high associated helium content.\nSlovenian Joint Venture Partner Insolvency & related disputes\nFurther to the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Ascent Slovenia Limited (\"ASL\") receiving a favourable interim award in Q4 2023 in relation to ASL's Slovenian arbitration claims for payment of 90% of the proceeds received by its joint-venture partner and the subsequent self-appointed insolvency of the joint-venture partner, after the period under review, ASL received a final award confirming that the amounts it claimed as owed were indeed owed to it.\nAccordingly, the tribunal decision confirms that ASL's interpretation of the terms of the Restated Joint Operating Agreement (the governing document and rules for the joint venture as amended in 2013) (\"RJOA\") is the correct one and has awarded ASL a further \u20ac4,990,976 plus interest since 19 January 2024 until payment in revenues owed to it from production above the baseline production profile, which is in addition to the amounts of \u20ac2,890,519.17 which has already been accepted by the Geoenergo administrator (\"Administrator\") and approved by the relevant insolvency court. Whilst ASL is entitled to these amounts, the recovery of these payments is subject to the finalisation of the administration of Geoenergo and consequently ASL may recover less than the full amount of what it is owed. Furthermore, the tribunal has also awarded costs of \u20ac79,234.83 which were claimed by ASL ahead of the insolvency of Geoenergo and which are now expected to be approved creditor claims in the Geoenergo insolvency estate and further amounts of \u20ac56,825 which are instructed to be paid in cash.\nSeparately to the award above, ASL has also been invited by the insolvency court to enter mediation with the Administrator in relation to the Administrator's attempts to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal which was lodged around the time ASL requested to resume the arbitration proceedings. ASL believes the administrators position on this is also manifestly wrong, a view which was supported by the tribunal which included one Slovenian senior judge (former Supreme and Constitutional Court Judge) but remains hopeful that an amicable agreement can be reached with the Administrator in the near term.\nThe Company also continues its disputes with Geoenergo's connected party and joint-venture service provider Petrol Geo d.o.o. and expects outcome of the Service Agreement (the agreement with which ASL and Geoenergo, together as joint-venture partners, entered into at the same time as the RJOA to appoint Petrol Geo to operate the joint venture wells) dispute in H2 2025, whereas the Framework Build Operate Transfer Agreement (an ancillary agreement between the joint venture partners and Petrol Geo relating to operation and future transfer of joint venture plant and property upon termination of the RJOA or concession contract and which was signed at the same time as the other agreements) dispute will is in the final stages of mediation, which if unsuccessful will likely result in ASL initiating arbitration.\nBoard Changes & Cost Savings\nFurther to the Company's transformation over the last eighteen months, which include significant advancement of its Slovenian legacy claims and a successful repurposing of the Company to focus itself on growing onshore US oil and gas with helium assets, the Company proposed to appoint David Patterson as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company, which was completed following customary on-boarding due diligence checks after the period under review. David is an experienced oil and gas explorer and geologist who has over 43 years of experience in the oil and gas industry onshore U.S. which includes several years of work in Utah and Colorado where most notably David was VP Geology for Rose Petroleum Plc (now called Zephyr Energy Plc) where he led the evaluation of over 250,000 acres of leases in Utah. David has held previous roles which include VP and manager of Exploration, VP of Geology, Supervisor of Reserves and Senior Geological Engineer in prior roles through his career. David is currently Partner and Technical Manager of Navarro Energy where he will also continue his role and he is retained by the Company for his services to Ascent with a salary of US$120,000 per annum, relating to which the Company has agreed with American Helium, Locin and ARB Energy that Ascent can re-charge the respective joint operations the full annual salary such that Ascent expects to pay US$43,200 of this amount per annum.\nDuring the period under review, Mr Andrew Dennan elected not to stand for re-election at the Company's upcoming AGM and retired as Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Company upon the convening of the AGM. Andrew has led Ascent for five years and felt this transformative moment was the right time to step aside as the business enters a new phase with a particular focus on U.S. onshore assets. He will continue to support the Company during an extended handover period to the proposed new CEO and will in addition continue to support the Company in its pursuit of the Company's highly valuable claims against the Republic of Slovenia under the ECT, as well as in insolvency and associated proceedings against its Slovenian former joint-venture partner and service provider. His detailed knowledge of these ongoing processes remains invaluable to Ascent. The Board are very thankful for the leadership and strategic input from Andrew over the last five years, where he has been instrumental in defending the Company's interests in Slovenia and re-purposing the Company to execute its new U.S. onshore growth strategy and wish him success in future pursuits.\nDuring the period under review the Company also announced that as part of the refining of its board composition it no longer intended to immediately appoint a Chairman to the Board and accordingly the Company will now not be appointing Mr Gilles Thieffry to that position as previously announced on 9 December 2024. Mr Jean-Michel Doublet initially assumed the role of Interim Chairman, which after the period under review was cemented with his appointment as Non-executive Chairman of the Company becoming effective.\nAdditionally, as part of positioning the Company to grow via a production-led strategy onshore U.S., the Company has implemented certain cash preservation measures which include current C-suite and Board of Directors of the Company agreeing to reduce the cash component of their employment and/or service contracts by 30% over the next six months and their corresponding intention to settle these owed amounts, by subscribing for equity on the same terms as the placing (above), as soon as they are either out of a closed period or otherwise not in receipt of insider information and can cause a PMDR dealing which was completed in June 2025. Furthermore, the Company also expects to implement further cost saving measures, which in aggregate with the above changes are expected to reduce the general and administrative cash costs of the business by approximately 20% per annum, with such savings expected to be realised through H2 2025 and beyond.\nCorporate\nIn May 2025, in support of the Company's expanded investment in U.S. onshore gas and helium markets, the Company successfully announced the raise of \u00a31.35 million (US$ 1.8 million) of additional equity via the issue of new shares at a placing price of 0.5 pence per new share. The new shares were issued with one warrant attached to every two placing shares subscribed for with the warrants being exercisable at a price of 1p per new warrant share at any time over the next two years. The Company also successfully re-profiled its existing senior secured debt with RiverFort by using\n\u00a3224,000\n(US$0.3 million)\nof the fundraising proceeds\nto partially redeem in cash part of the RiverFort senior secured loan (as originally announced on 22 April 2024) and RiverFort agreed to convert US$100,000 of loan principal into equity at a price of 0.7245 pence per share (representing a 44% premium to the fundraising issue price).\nThe Company has further agreed with RiverFort to extend the remaining balance of the senior secured loan, being US$1.05 million (inclusive of remaining principal and outstanding coupon) on the same terms as announced 22 April 2024, save that the balance outstanding will accrue a 10% extension fee which will be added on to the outstanding balance and the loan notes will be amended with an extension of the maturity date to 22 April 2027. The loan notes have retained a fixed conversion price of 1p per conversion share throughout the term of the loan note through to the extended maturity date, save as if the Company issues new equity securities at a price below 0.71 pence per new share during the term of the loan then the conversion price will automatically reset to a 40% premium to such future placing price in the event it is less than 0.71 pence per new share. Furthermore, Ascent expects to redeem US$250,000 of principal on the 22 April 2026 and to amend the warrant deeds relating to 18,439,431 existing warrants such that they are exercisable at 1p per warrant share at any time over the next four years and the Company has agreed to issue RiverFort with warrants equal to 35% of the reprofiled debt amount exercisable at 1p per warrant share. For the avoidance of doubt this re-profiling of senior secured debt is at a fixed conversion price, and the lender will not have any rights to convert into new equity of Ascent at a price below this level during the term of the loan notes.\nThe balance of new fundraising proceeds raised are being used to fund Ascent corporate costs and investment in the initial campaign to install artificial lift technologies on at least six existing wells included in the newly acquired ARB Energy acreage.\nFurthermore, the 9,480,000 million warrants issued to the December 2024 subscribers have reset in accordance with their terms such that there is now a revised total of 43,608,000 million warrants in issue which are exercisable at 0.5 pence per revised warrant share.\nFor the period to 30 June 2025, the Company has only recognised limited production revenues from the U.S., derived from sales to an industrial client, since the GNG Lisbon plant remained offline and unable to process American Helium's gas flow, and the effective closing date of the ARB and Locin operated assets being 1 July 2025. Administrative costs in H1 2025 were higher than in H1 2024, most notably due to exceptional one-off workstreams relating to the shareholder distribution and costs of initiating the Company's insolvency claim in against its former JV partner.\nOutlook\nThe Company is well positioned at the end of H1 2025 to be a U.S. onshore upstream oil and gas producer following the Company having (i) completed a second distribution to shareholders with ring fenced access to 41% of the net proceeds to be received in the event of a positive ECT claim outcome in February, (ii) scaled the Company's position and interests in producing and discovered reserves of natural gas with proven helium included in the gas streams, (iii) implemented a cost savings initiative and refocused its executive team on industrial upstream operations, and (iv) continued its resolute defence of the Company and its subsidiary's claims in Slovenia. With GNG looking to secure a significant investment after the period under review, we expect a significant increase in production from American Helium's operated acreage by calendar year-end.\nJean-Michel Doublet\nNon-Executive Chairman\nQualified Person's Statement\nDave Patterson, CEO of the Company and a qualified Geologist with over 40 years of relevant experience in the oil and gas industry has reviewed this announcement for the purposes of the current Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in June 2009 and in accordance with the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) issued in June 2018 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG), the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) and the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE).\nConsolidated Income Statement\nfor the Period ended 30 June 2025\nNotes\nPeriod ended\n30 June 2025\n\u00a3'000s\nPeriod ended\n30 June 2024\n\u00a3'000s\nRevenue\n2\n78\n1\nCost of sales\n(429)\n(26)\nDepreciation of oil & gas assets\n(1)\n(1)\nGross (Loss)/Profit\n(352)\n(26)\nOther income\n12\n-\nAdministrative expenses\n(858)\n(786)\nDecommissioning provision\n(106)\nImpairment of prepaid abandonment fund\n-\n(240)\n(Loss)/Profit from operating activities\n(1,304)\n(1,052)\nFinance income\n45\n-\nFinance cost\n(22)\n(23)\nNet finance costs\n23\n(23)\n(Loss)/Profit before taxation\n(1,281)\n(1,075)\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\n(Loss)/Profit for the period after tax\n(1,281)\n(1,075)\n(Loss)/Profit) for the period attributable to equity shareholders\n(1,281)\n(1,075)\nEarnings per share\nBasic & fully diluted (loss)/profit per share (\u00a3)\n3\n(0.34)\n(0.50)\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the Period ended 30 June 2025\nNotes\nPeriod ended\n30 June 2025\n\u00a3'000s\nPeriod ended\n30 June 2024\n\u00a3'000s\nProfit / (loss) for the period\n(1,281)\n(1,075)\nOther comprehensive income\nForeign currency translation differences for foreign operations\n(10)\n3\nTotal comprehensive gain / (loss) for the period\n(1,291)\n(1,072)\nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position\nAs at 30 June 2025\nNotes\n30 June\n2025\n\u00a3'000s\n31 December\n2024\n\u00a3'000s\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment\n709\n710\nOther debtors\n4\n662\n677\nPrepayments\n5\n197\n216\nTotal non-current assets\n1,568\n1,603\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n5\n187\n415\nCash and cash equivalents\n458\n111\nTotal current assets\n645\n526\nTotal assets\n2,213\n2,129\nEquity and liabilities\nAttributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company\nPreference shares\n15\n-\nShare capital\n8\n10,430\n8,989\nShare premium account\n79,684\n79,703\nMerger reserve\n570\n570\nShare-based payment reserve\n9\n644\n726\nOther equity reserves\n124\n124\nTranslation reserves\n(244)\n(234)\nRetained earnings\n(91,522)\n(90,346)\nTotal equity attributable to the shareholders\n(299)\n(468)\nTotal equity\n(299)\n(468)\nNon-current liabilities\nProvisions\n1,050\n1,019\nTotal non-current liabilities\n1,050\n1,019\nCurrent liabilities\nConvertible loan notes\n7\n540\n780\nDerivative liability\n7\n13\n13\nTrade and other payables\n6\n909\n785\nTotal current liabilities\n1,462\n1,578\nTotal liabilities\n2,512\n2,597\nTotal equity and liabilities\n2,213\n2,129\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\nfor the period ended 30 June 2024\nShare capital\nShare premium\nMerger reserve\nShare based payment reserve\nOther Reserves\nTranslation reserve\nRetained earnings\nTotal\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nBalance at 1 January 2024\n8,495\n77,889\n570\n574\n-\n(258)\n(87,648)\n(378)\nComprehensive income\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1,075)\n(1,075)\nOther comprehensive income\nCurrency translation differences\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3\n-\n3\nTotal comprehensive income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3\n(1,075)\n(1,072)\nTransactions with owners\nIssue of ordinary shares\n147\n532\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n679\nCosts related to share issues\n-\n(23)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(23)\nShare-based payments -

Accounting Policies\nReporting entity\nAscent Resources plc is a company domiciled in England. The address of the Company's registered office is 5 New Street Square, London EC4A 3TW. The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at 30\u00a0June 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the \"Group\").\nBasis of preparation\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The interim financial information has been prepared using the accounting policies which were applied in the Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nAll amounts have been prepared in British pounds, this being the Group's presentational currency.\nThe interim financial information for the six months to 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 are unaudited and does not constitute statutory financial information. The comparatives for the full year ended 31 December 2024 are not the Group's full statutory accounts for that year. The information given for the year ended 31 December 2024 does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined by Section 435 of the Companies Act. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been filed with the Registrar and are available on the Company's web site\nwww.ascentresources.co.uk\n. The auditors' report on those accounts was unqualified. It did not contain a statement under Section 498(2)-(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nNew Standards adopted as at 1 January 2025\nAccounting pronouncements which have become effective from 1 January 2025 do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial results or position.\nNew accounting policies adopted for the interim period ended 30 June 2025\nPreference shares\nThe Company issued preference shares which have been classified as equity instruments, as they do not contain any contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset and the payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company. Dividends on these shares are recognised as a distribution to equity holders when they are declared. No liability is recognised for dividends until such time as they are approved by the Board of Directors.\nGoing Concern\nThe Financial Statements of the Group are prepared on a going concern basis.\nOn 22 May 2025, the Company raised gross proceeds of \u00a31.35 million via an equity fundraise. These funds are being used to fund its investment into the installation of artificial lift technologies on certain existing wells in the ARB Energy acreage, as well as general corporate costs.\nBased on historical and recent support from new and existing investors the Board believes that such funding, if and when required, could be obtained through new debt or equity issuances. The Company is also seeking to monetise some of its large prospect inventory to farm-out new drilling opportunities and is already in advanced discussions with interested parties. However, there can be no guarantee over the outcome of these options and as a consequence there is a material uncertainty surrounding the Group's ability to raise the necessary finance, which may cast doubt on the Group's ability to operate as a going concern. Further, the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties:\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business activities of the Group remain those detailed on pages 14-18 of the\u00a0Annual Review 2024, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at\nwww.ascentresources.co.uk\n.\n2.

GNG Partners LLC used these funds to acquire the assets of\u00a0Paradox Resources LLC. Other key terms of the convertible loan notes are as follows:\n- Date of maturity of April 2026;\n- The notes have a zero-coupon; and\n- Converts, at the election of the Company, into 1 million membership units of GNG.\nThe convertible loan note is held at amortised cost. Management determined the present value to be \u00a3676,942 using the present value formula, resulting in a loss of \u00a3194,256. Interest income of \u00a344,444 (31 December 2024: \u00a371,487) has been recognised and is being unwound evenly over the period of the loan.\n5.

Borrowings\nGroup\n30 June 2025\n\u00a3'000s\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3'000s\nCurrent\nConvertible loan notes\n540\n780\nDerivative liability - conversion feature\n13\n13\nNon-current\nBorrowing\n-\n-\n553\n793\nConvertible loan notes\nIn April 2024, the Company entered into a US$2million secured fixed coupon loan facility with RiverFort Global Opportunities (\"RiverFort\"). Under the agreement the Company received a first advance of US$1million less the historic debt netted against this of \u00a393,383 leaving a cash receipt of $0.883million (\u00a3708,992) as the loan amount issued on 24 April 2024 (the \"Initial Loan\"). Further advances will take place subject to mutual agreement between the Company and RiverFort. The Initial Loan has a 12-month term, during which it is convertible at a fixed price of\u00a03.22 pence, being a 40% fixed premium to the issue price. The loan includes a 7% drawdown fee plus transaction closing costs which were payable via the issue of 2,962,426 new ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the Company.\nThe Initial Loan has a 15% fixed coupon attached to it, payable on redemption, and warrants equal to 33% of the Initial Loan amount exercisable at 140% of the Issue Price at any time during the next four years. The Loan is secured against a company debenture.\nThe gross amount of the loan payable is US$1million, this has been accounted for under amortised cost. An effective interest rate of 15% has been applied and this has been unwound over the term of the loan.\nUnder IFRS, the conversion feature of the loan has been bifurcated from the host debt liability and recognised initially at fair value and remeasured to fair value at the year end reporting date with the movements in fair value recognised in the profit and loss account. Transaction costs have been allocated proportionately between the host debt liability and the conversion feature, with the portion relating to the conversion feature being expensed immediately in profit and loss account. The portion relating to the host debt liability has been deducted against the carrying value of the host debt liability, and the portion relating to warrants deducted against equity. The host debt liability is accounted for under amortised cost using the appropriate discount rate which is deemed to be 20%. The warrants are measured at the residual amount of the transaction price less the fair value of the conversion feature and the present value of the host debt liability.\nThe fair value of the conversion feature was established using an appropriate model which resulted in a value of \u00a313,592 at the year end. The host debt liability is \u00a3774,545 and the equity component is \u00a3123,597. (There is a brought forward CLN balance of \u00a35,000).\nOn 22 May 2025, $100,000 of the outstanding host debt liability was converted to 10,300,465 ordinary shares. On 11 June 2025, \u00a3300,000 was repaid to Riverfort. After these two transactions the host debt liability is \u00a3478,507. Unwinding of the 15% effective interest rate has resulted in an increase of \u00a323,169, leaving a host debt liability as at 30 June 2025 of \u00a3535,119.\nThe movement in the loans is analysed as follows:\nBorrowings & CLN\n30 June 2025\n\u00a3'000s\nAt 1 January 2025\n780\nLoan repayment\n(221)\nConversion of loan to shares\n(75)\nInterest charged on principle\n23\nForeign exchange adjustment\n33\nAt 30 June 2025\n540\nBorrowings & CLN\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3'000s\nAt 1 January 2024\n189\nLoan repayment\n(91)\nAddition - Host debt liability\n709\nPresent value adjustment\n(192)\nInterest charged on principle\n203\nTransaction costs of the Convertible loan note\n(53)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n15\nAt 31 December 2024\n780\n8.

Whilst Ascent Slovenia Limited is entitled to these amounts, the recovery of these payments is subject to the finalisation of the administration of Geoenergo and consequently Ascent Slovenia Limited may recover less than the full value of what it is owed.\nOn 9 July 2025, Mr\u00a0David Patterson\u00a0was appointed as Chief Executive Officer.\n0n 15 July 2025, 215,274,654 new Ordinary shares, each of\u00a00.5 pence nominal value were issued. 89,552,239 of the new shares were issued\u00a0to\u00a0Locin Oil Corporation, as consideration for a 49% share of their interest in certain oil and gas leases in\u00a0Colorado. 111,940,299 of the new shares were issued to\u00a0Arb Energy Utah, LLC\u00a0as consideration for a 49% share of their interest in certain oil and gas leases in\u00a0Utah.
