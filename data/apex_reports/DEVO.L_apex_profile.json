(AIM: DEVO), an award-winning digital publisher and developer of indie video games, announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31st December 2025. All financial figures relate to that period unless otherwise stated.\n2025 full year performance showed improvement over 2024 with growth in both revenues and Adjusted EBITDA1. Revenue performance in 2H 2025 was strong and in-line with expectations, bolstered by the timing of platform deals and the Steam Publisher Sale in September, resulting in management meeting guidance\nof more than US$100m in full year revenues. Underlying Adjusted EBITDA pre-impairments is expected to reach USD double-digit millions, marginally higher than consensus expectations, while an initial unaudited estimate of impairments for released title underperformance is c. $3.5 million.\nNew games released in 2025 maintained very high-quality levels with a full-year average Metacritic score of 78. Notable successes such as\nMonster Train 2\nreleased by publisher subsidiary Big Fan\n, Stronghold: Crusader\nreleased by subsidiary studio Firefly\n,\nand recent sensation\nBall x Pit\nall garnered high-quality scores and user reviews and collectively bolstered front catalogue revenues. Lower cost titles\nMycopunk\nand\nLook Outside\ngarnered favourable user reviews and performed ahead of expectations. System Era also continued making a solid contribution, with\nAstroneer\nreleasing its second PDLC\nMegatech\nin November 2025.\nDevolver has continued its disciplined approach to cost control, with FY25 operating expenses falling slightly compared to FY24. The Board remain committed to delivering efficiencies across the Group, with a continued focus on cost management going into 2026. Devolver has a robust balance sheet with c.US$36.4 million net cash as of 31 December 2025.\n2026 has started strongly with\nQuarantine Zone: The Last Check\nexceeding expectations in the first weeks of its release, and\nCult of the Lamb\n's highly anticipated PDLC\nWoolhaven\nreceiving rave reviews. Notably, Devolver recorded a historic milestone in January with three titles (\nWoolhaven\n,\nCult of the Lamb\nand\nQuarantine Zone: The Last Check\n) all featuring in the Steam2 Global Best Sellers Top 10 list, the first time in Devolver's history.\nHarry Miller, Chief Executive Officer at Devolver, said\n:\n\"We are pleased to have delivered revenues that grew year-over-year, in a gaming market that was flat overall, and met our guidance in 2025, driven by a string of successful new launches by Devolver and its subsidiary companies. And seeing three Devolver titles ranking in Steam's Top 10 Global Best Sellers is a huge historic milestone for us.\nAn overall solid portfolio performance, coupled with sustained operating cost control, resulted in another year of steady improvement in both revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, a very strong early start to 2026 gives us good momentum to deliver further profit improvement this year.\nThe calculated strategies that we began 3 years ago, including an improved greenlight process, in-house developed technologies, cost cutting, improved store management, among others, continue to lead us out of the trough of 2023. The continued adoption and maturation of these strategies,\u00a0along with cycling through products initiated prior to such efforts, give us visibility to reaching higher sustainable profitability in the coming years.\"\nThe Group will announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.\n-ENDS-\nNotes:\n1.\nAdjusted EBITDA (\"EBITDA\") makes the following adjustments: it excludes: 1) stock compensation (share-based payment) expenses and revaluation of contingent consideration; 2) one-time expenses and other non-recurring items; 3) amortisation of IP (but does not exclude amortisation of capitalised software development costs), and; 4) impairments of goodwill and acquired IP. Title performance impairments are included in Adjusted EBITDA.\n2.\nSteam is the world's largest one-stop-shop platform for gamers to buy, store and play video games.\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The 2025 Awards are designed to reward employees at all levels of the Company for performance that delivers value for shareholders. The LTIP awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"\nPSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"\nRSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two-year cliff for other employees with financial performance criteria for senior employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 7,081,612 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.5 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.7 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nTotal\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n1,927,223\n2,873,071\n4,800,294\nOther employees and contractors\n1,831,318\n-\n1,831,318\nTotal\n3,758,541\n2,873,071\n6,631,612\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2025, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2026. All PSUs vest after three years, on 31st December 2027. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees.\nIn addition to the vesting cliffs, the 2025 Awards are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award.\nThe metrics in the table below, which are applicable to PSUs only, apply to actual 2027 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2027:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CFO, require at least 60% of the EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the RSU award to vest. EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this performance target applies to 50% of their RSU grant. No performance targets are applied to RSUs granted to all other employees.\nThe co-founders of Devolver who are\u00a0full-time employees at the company, CEO Harry Miller, COO Graeme Struthers and CMO Nigel Lowrie, have not received any share awards under the LTIP\u00a0since the LTIP's launch in 2022. As in 2024, this year the Board has instead awarded them a performance-linked\u00a0cash\u00a0bonus based on the same targets\u00a0and timing\u00a0as the\u00a02025\u00a0Awards to senior management.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.
