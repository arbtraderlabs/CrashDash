The 2025 Awards are designed to reward employees at all levels of the Company for performance that delivers value for shareholders. The LTIP awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"\nPSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"\nRSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two-year cliff for other employees with financial performance criteria for senior employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 7,081,612 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.5 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.7 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nTotal\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n1,927,223\n2,873,071\n4,800,294\nOther employees and contractors\n1,831,318\n-\n1,831,318\nTotal\n3,758,541\n2,873,071\n6,631,612\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2025, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2026. All PSUs vest after three years, on 31st December 2027. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees.\nIn addition to the vesting cliffs, the 2025 Awards are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award.\nThe metrics in the table below, which are applicable to PSUs only, apply to actual 2027 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2027:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CFO, require at least 60% of the EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the RSU award to vest. EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this performance target applies to 50% of their RSU grant. No performance targets are applied to RSUs granted to all other employees.\nThe co-founders of Devolver who are\u00a0full-time employees at the company, CEO Harry Miller, COO Graeme Struthers and CMO Nigel Lowrie, have not received any share awards under the LTIP\u00a0since the LTIP's launch in 2022. As in 2024, this year the Board has instead awarded them a performance-linked\u00a0cash\u00a0bonus based on the same targets\u00a0and timing\u00a0as the\u00a02025\u00a0Awards to senior management.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.
