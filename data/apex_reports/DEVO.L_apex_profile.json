(AIM: DEVO), an award-winning digital publisher and developer of indie video games, announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31st December 2025. All financial figures relate to that period unless otherwise stated.\n2025 full year performance showed improvement over 2024 with growth in both revenues and Adjusted EBITDA1. Revenue performance in 2H 2025 was strong and in-line with expectations, bolstered by the timing of platform deals and the Steam Publisher Sale in September, resulting in management meeting guidance\nof more than US$100m in full year revenues. Underlying Adjusted EBITDA pre-impairments is expected to reach USD double-digit millions, marginally higher than consensus expectations, while an initial unaudited estimate of impairments for released title underperformance is c. $3.5 million.\nNew games released in 2025 maintained very high-quality levels with a full-year average Metacritic score of 78. Notable successes such as\nMonster Train 2\nreleased by publisher subsidiary Big Fan\n, Stronghold: Crusader\nreleased by subsidiary studio Firefly\n,\nand recent sensation\nBall x Pit\nall garnered high-quality scores and user reviews and collectively bolstered front catalogue revenues. Lower cost titles\nMycopunk\nand\nLook Outside\ngarnered favourable user reviews and performed ahead of expectations. System Era also continued making a solid contribution, with\nAstroneer\nreleasing its second PDLC\nMegatech\nin November 2025.\nDevolver has continued its disciplined approach to cost control, with FY25 operating expenses falling slightly compared to FY24. The Board remain committed to delivering efficiencies across the Group, with a continued focus on cost management going into 2026. Devolver has a robust balance sheet with c.US$36.4 million net cash as of 31 December 2025.\n2026 has started strongly with\nQuarantine Zone: The Last Check\nexceeding expectations in the first weeks of its release, and\nCult of the Lamb\n's highly anticipated PDLC\nWoolhaven\nreceiving rave reviews. Notably, Devolver recorded a historic milestone in January with three titles (\nWoolhaven\n,\nCult of the Lamb\nand\nQuarantine Zone: The Last Check\n) all featuring in the Steam2 Global Best Sellers Top 10 list, the first time in Devolver's history.\nHarry Miller, Chief Executive Officer at Devolver, said\n:\n\"We are pleased to have delivered revenues that grew year-over-year, in a gaming market that was flat overall, and met our guidance in 2025, driven by a string of successful new launches by Devolver and its subsidiary companies. And seeing three Devolver titles ranking in Steam's Top 10 Global Best Sellers is a huge historic milestone for us.\nAn overall solid portfolio performance, coupled with sustained operating cost control, resulted in another year of steady improvement in both revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, a very strong early start to 2026 gives us good momentum to deliver further profit improvement this year.\nThe calculated strategies that we began 3 years ago, including an improved greenlight process, in-house developed technologies, cost cutting, improved store management, among others, continue to lead us out of the trough of 2023. The continued adoption and maturation of these strategies,\u00a0along with cycling through products initiated prior to such efforts, give us visibility to reaching higher sustainable profitability in the coming years.\"\nThe Group will announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.\n-ENDS-\nNotes:\n1.\nAdjusted EBITDA (\"EBITDA\") makes the following adjustments: it excludes: 1) stock compensation (share-based payment) expenses and revaluation of contingent consideration; 2) one-time expenses and other non-recurring items; 3) amortisation of IP (but does not exclude amortisation of capitalised software development costs), and; 4) impairments of goodwill and acquired IP. Title performance impairments are included in Adjusted EBITDA.\n2.\nSteam is the world's largest one-stop-shop platform for gamers to buy, store and play video games.\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The 2025 Awards are designed to reward employees at all levels of the Company for performance that delivers value for shareholders. The LTIP awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"\nPSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"\nRSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two-year cliff for other employees with financial performance criteria for senior employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 7,081,612 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.5 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.7 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nTotal\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n1,927,223\n2,873,071\n4,800,294\nOther employees and contractors\n1,831,318\n-\n1,831,318\nTotal\n3,758,541\n2,873,071\n6,631,612\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2025, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2026. All PSUs vest after three years, on 31st December 2027. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees.\nIn addition to the vesting cliffs, the 2025 Awards are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award.\nThe metrics in the table below, which are applicable to PSUs only, apply to actual 2027 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2027:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CFO, require at least 60% of the EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the RSU award to vest. EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this performance target applies to 50% of their RSU grant. No performance targets are applied to RSUs granted to all other employees.\nThe co-founders of Devolver who are\u00a0full-time employees at the company, CEO Harry Miller, COO Graeme Struthers and CMO Nigel Lowrie, have not received any share awards under the LTIP\u00a0since the LTIP's launch in 2022. As in 2024, this year the Board has instead awarded them a performance-linked\u00a0cash\u00a0bonus based on the same targets\u00a0and timing\u00a0as the\u00a02025\u00a0Awards to senior management.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The 2025 Awards are designed to reward employees at all levels of the Company for performance that delivers value for shareholders. The LTIP awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"\nPSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"\nRSUs\n\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two-year cliff for other employees with financial performance criteria for senior employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 7,081,612 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.5 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.7 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nTotal\n142,742\n307,258\n450,000\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n1,927,223\n2,873,071\n4,800,294\nOther employees and contractors\n1,831,318\n-\n1,831,318\nTotal\n3,758,541\n2,873,071\n6,631,612\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2025, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2026. All PSUs vest after three years, on 31st December 2027. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees.\nIn addition to the vesting cliffs, the 2025 Awards are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award.\nThe metrics in the table below, which are applicable to PSUs only, apply to actual 2027 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2027:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n<90% of target\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CFO, require at least 60% of the EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the RSU award to vest. EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this performance target applies to 50% of their RSU grant. No performance targets are applied to RSUs granted to all other employees.\nThe co-founders of Devolver who are\u00a0full-time employees at the company, CEO Harry Miller, COO Graeme Struthers and CMO Nigel Lowrie, have not received any share awards under the LTIP\u00a0since the LTIP's launch in 2022. As in 2024, this year the Board has instead awarded them a performance-linked\u00a0cash\u00a0bonus based on the same targets\u00a0and timing\u00a0as the\u00a02025\u00a0Awards to senior management.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The 2025 awards are designed to incentivise various employees at the leadership level of the Company for performance that delivers value for shareholders in future. The 2025 Plan awards consist of Stock Options (\"Options\") which are awarded subject to annual vesting over 3 years (1/3 each year), with a 6-month lock up at each vesting period.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 21,687,070 options (on the assumption that all vest), representing 4.6 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.6 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.

The Circular outlining the proposed resolutions will be posted on the Company's website later today and contains the notice convening the Special Meeting and instructions to shareholders on how to vote at the Special Meeting.\nBackground to and reasons for the Special Meeting\nDevolver has approximately 270 employees worldwide in total. There are 148 outstanding grants of options and warrants made to 100 recipients pursuant to the Devolver Digital, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"\n2017 Plan\n\") (or in respect of warrants, made under a stand-alone agreement on substantially the same terms as the 2017 Plan). Of these grants, 133 are 'underwater', with exercise prices per Share of \u00a30.31 to \u00a30.33 and \u00a30.50 that are above the Current VWAP of \u00a30.27 (the \"\nUnderwater Stock Options\n\" and \"\nUnderwater Warrants\n\").\nThe Board wishes to re-set the Company's equity incentive arrangements with the aim of re-incentivising staff across the Group to support the forward trajectory of the Company and build on the work over the last 18 months. The Board intends to do this in three ways:\nProposals in respect of the 2017 Plan and the Underwater Warrants\n: the Board intends to make an offer to stock option holders and warrant holders to amend the terms of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants (as such terms are described in the Circular), as follows:\na. repricing the exercise price of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants to align with the prevailing fair market value of the Shares;\nb. reducing the overall quantum of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants (reduced by: (i) c. 15 per cent. for those holders who were granted stock options or warrants with an exercise price between \u00a30.31 and \u00a30.33; and (ii) 30 per cent. for those holders who were granted stock options or warrants with an exercise price of \u00a30.50 (but in each case subject to the adjustments further described in the Circular);\nc. resetting the exercise period of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants to 10 years from the date when these amendments become effective; and\nd.\namending the leaver provisions which apply to the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants (as more particularly described in the Circular).\nProposals in respect of the Devolver Digital, Inc 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan\")\n: the Board does not intend to make any changes to any awards made under this plan and shall also retain the existing 2022 Plan so that it might make future awards subject to key performance conditions and targets thereunder.\nProposals in respect of the adoption of a new Devolver Digital, Inc 2025 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2025 Plan\")\n: the Board intends to adopt a new 2025 Plan so that it might make awards thereunder. Subject to Shareholder approval, it is proposed that the awards to be made under the 2025 Plan will comprise one-off stock option grants to certain key senior employees.\nAccordingly, the purpose of the Special Meeting is to ask Shareholders to:\n\u00b7\nResolution 1\n: approve the amendments described in the Circular to the terms of the Underwater Stock Options and the Underwater Warrants\n\u00b7\nResolution 2\n: approve the terms of the Company's new 2025 Plan\n\u00b7\nResolution 3\n: grant authority to allot Shares and\ngrant rights over Shares pursuant to the Plans\nRecommendations\nThe Directors believe that the resolutions will promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the Special Meeting, as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings, amounting to (in aggregate)\n128,423,371\nShares, representing\n27.1\nper cent. of the Issued and Outstanding Share Capital of the Company at the date of this document.\nCapitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement have the meanings given to them in the Circular posted on the Company's website earlier today:\nhttps://investors.devolverdigital.com/\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

(AIM: DEVO), an award-winning digital publisher and developer of indie video games, announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31st\u00a0December 2024. All financial figures relate to that period unless otherwise stated.\nPerformance improved steadily as Devolver returned to positive Adjusted EBITDA1. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in line with market expectations2, including non-cash title impairments, of which US$1.7m was reflected in the Group's 1H 2024 results. Revenues saw double-digit year-on-year growth, meeting management guidance\nof more than US$100m for the year.\nNew games released in 2024 achieved a new record high full-year average Metacritic score of 79. Award winning games such as\nThe Plucky Squire\nand\nNeva\ngarnered high quality scores and user reviews which bolstered front catalogue revenues. This was supported by continued strength in back catalogue revenue (over 19% year-on-year growth) including titles\u00a0such as\nCult of The Lamb\nand\nInscryption\nwhich continue to enjoy strong demand.\nCult of the Lamb\n's paid down-loadable content (PDLC) performed strongly as part of the strategy of ongoing investment into successful franchises. System Era also made a strong contribution, with\nAstroneer\nreaching a new milestone with the successful release of\nGlitchwalkers\nPDLC generating new revenues and boosting base game sales.\nDevolver has continued its disciplined approach to cost control, with operating expenses being maintained at similar levels to FY23. The Board remain committed to delivering efficiencies across the Group, with a continued focus on cost management going into 2025. Devolver has a robust balance sheet with c.US$42 million net cash as at 31 December 2024.\nHarry Miller, Chief Executive Officer at Devolver, said\n:\n\"We returned to positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 largely driven by strong back catalogue revenues supplemented by exciting new releases such as The Plucky Squire, Neva and Anger Foot, and a full year contribution from new acquisition System Era and their iconic title Astroneer. Our strong recovery owes to the creative enterprise we are, attributable in part to our innovative game designs and lasting relationships with talented developers. Combining this momentum from 2024 with the Group's strong release pipeline, we expect to see further profit improvement in 2025.\"\nThe Group will announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2024 in 1H April 2025.\n-ENDS-\nNotes:\n1.\nAdjusted EBITDA (\"EBITDA\") makes the following adjustments: it excludes: 1) stock compensation (share-based payment) expenses and revaluation of contingent consideration; 2) one-time expenses and other non-recurring items; 3) amortisation of IP (but does not exclude amortisation of capitalised software development costs), and; 4) impairments of goodwill and acquired IP. Title performance impairments are included in Adjusted EBITDA.\n2.\nAnalyst consensus for FY24: Revenue US$106.5m; Adjusted EBITDA US$5.2m\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The LTIP awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"PSUs\") which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two-year cliff for other employees with financial performance criteria for senior employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 8,568,079 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.8 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.2 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n153,333\n306,667\n460,000\nTotal\n153,333\n306,667\n460,000\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n2,571,499\n3,590,487\n6,161,986\nOther employees and contractors\n1,946,093\n-\n1,946,093\nTotal\n4,517,592\n3,590,487\n8,108,079\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2024, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2025. All PSUs vest after three years, on 31st December 2026. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees.\nIn addition to the vesting cliffs, the LTIP shares are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award. The metrics in the table below, which are applicable to PSUs only, apply to actual 2026 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2026:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CFO, require at least 60% of the EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the LTIP Shares awarded to vest. EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this performance target only applies to 50% of their RSU grant. No performance targets are applied to RSUs granted to all other employees.\nThe co-founders of Devolver who are\u00a0full-time employees at the company, CEO Harry Miller, COO Graeme Struthers and CMO Nigel Lowrie, have not received any awards under the LTIP\u00a0since the LTIP's launch in 2022. This year the Board has instead awarded them a performance-linked\u00a0cash\u00a0bonus based on the same targets\u00a0and timing\u00a0as the\u00a02024\u00a0LTIP\u00a0awards\n.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The accelerated bookbuild will be launched immediately following this Announcement.\nThe Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this Announcement.\nThe timing of the closing of the Bookbuild and the final number and allocation of Placing Shares will be determined at the discretion of the Company (in consultation with Zeus). The Broker reserves the right, by agreement with the Company, to increase the size of the Placing to accommodate additional demand.\nThe Placing, which is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this Announcement, is conditional upon,\ninter alia\n, Admission becoming effective and the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional in all respects by no later than 8.00 a.m. on 05 July 2024 (or such later time and/or date, being not later than 15 July 2024, as the Company and Zeus may agree). Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM. It is expected that Admission will occur and that dealings will commence at 8.00 a.m. on 05 July 2024.\nThe Placing Shares will rank, on issue,\npari passu\nin all respects with the existing shares of common stock of $0.0001 each in the capital of the Company and will be issued free from all liens, charges and encumbrances.

We needed to take long-term decisions to get us back to growth and profit in 2024 and future years. For example, we pushed back high potential titles to 2024, we turned down subscription deals that under-valued our IP and we reduced our cost base. This is all about doubling down on what we are good at: delivering a strong pipeline of fun and creative new titles. I'd like to thank our talented team for their dedication and energy during a challenging year. It's thanks to our people that we had a strong finish to 2023, with 10% 2H sequential revenue growth and a return to profit in the second half of the year.\nLooking ahead to 2024, our recent acquisition System Era is performing well and gives us opportunities to develop into expandable games. We have a busy and exciting release schedule of new titles such as Pepper Grinder, The Plucky Squire, Anger Foot and Neva. Back catalogue sales are expected to continue to benefit from momentum from Cult of the Lamb and Inscryption which have continued to perform s",

(AIM: DEVO), an award-winning digital publisher and developer of indie video games, announces the following changes to its Board and leadership team, as part of planning for Devolver's long-term growth and development.\nChief Executive Officer succession\nDouglas Morin has stepped down from his role as CEO and Board member and will be succeeded by Harry Miller, Executive Chairman and major shareholder, who is today appointed as CEO, with immediate effect. Douglas joined Devolver as Chief of Staff in 2020 and was appointed CEO in 2021. Douglas played a vital role in Devolver's IPO, strengthened the corporate and operating structure of the listed company, and championed the acquisition of System Era Softworks.\nHarry is co-founder and former CEO of Devolver, establishing the Company in 2009 with Rick Stults, Graeme Struthers, Nigel Lowrie and Mike Wilson. In the past 15 years - two of which as Executive Chairman since IPO in 2021 - Harry has been instrumental in defining and building Devolver's business and culture into the award-winning independent video games publisher and developer it has become. Harry has almost 30 years of video games experience, having established and managed a number of publishing and developing businesses in the video gaming sector including Ritual Entertainment (co-founder and CEO), Gathering of Developers (co-founder and President), Hong Kong-based En-Tranz Entertainment (CEO) and Gamecock Media (President).\nChair appointment\nDevolver also announces that Kate Marsh, Senior Independent Director since Devolver's IPO in November 2021, has been appointed as Non-Executive Chair with immediate effect. Kate will step down as Chair of the Remuneration Committee to become Chair of the Nomination Committee and will continue to sit on the Remuneration and Audit Committees. Kate has more than 30 years of experience in digital and media industries, having built and managed significant businesses in senior roles with Sky, GroupM, the BBC, Sony Pictures Television and most recently with Amazon-owned MGM Studios. Kate serves as a Non-Executive Director on the Board of FTSE 250 Games Workshop Group plc where she chairs the Remuneration Committee and has also served at Board level for Mediahuis Ireland (formerly INM plc).\nAdditional Board changes\nThe Company also announces that Graeme Struthers, Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of Devolver, will join the Board with immediate effect. Graeme is a co-founder of Devolver and was appointed as Chief Operating Officer in 2022 to oversee a strengthening of the leadership team and operational structures following the IPO in 2021. Before Devolver, Graeme worked across a number of games companies, including Virgin Interactive and Electronic Arts.\nJo Goodson, Non-Executive Director, will step down as Chair of the Nomination Committee to become Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\nHarry Miller said:\n\"On behalf of the Board and everyone at Devolver, I would like to thank Douglas for his significant commitment and achievements at Devolver in the last four years. Douglas' energy, leadership and determination were critical to our IPO and programme to build our infrastructure as a listed company, culminating in the exciting System Era acquisition. I am excited by the opportunity to step back into the CEO role. It's an incredible pleasure and honour to continue to work with Devolver's fantastic and talented team, building out a strong pipeline of fun and creativity, and of course delivering on our long-term growth strategy.\"\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

All financial figures relate to that period unless otherwise stated.\nPerformance recovered steadily in the second half of 2023, which delivered a positive Normalised Adjusted EBITDA2 in 2H. Full year 2023 revenues are expected to be in line with consensus expectations at not less than US$90 million and Normalised Adjusted EBITDA is expected to breakeven excluding non-cash title impairments of up to US$2.5m, of which US$0.9m was already reflected in 1H 2023.

After a quiet year in 2023 for major title releases, we enter 2024 with a release schedule featuring wonderful titles such as Pepper Grinder, The Plucky Squire, Anger Foot and NEVA, with releases more evenly balanced throughout the year. In addition, we will enjoy a full year of contribution from recently acquired System Era which takes us into the exciting area of expandable games and has performed in line with expectations since acquisition. As a result of this momentum for our strategy heading into 2024,\nwe expect Normalised Adjusted EBITDA to return to growth in 2024 and accelerate in 2025.\n\"\n-ENDS-\nNotes\n1.\nFinancial numbers contained within this Trading Update are based on preliminary unaudited 2023 results and will include impairments which are currently being reviewed.\u00a0The second half 2023 impairment relates to one title published by Good Shepherd.\n2.\nNormalised Adjusted EBITDA (\"EBITDA\") makes the following adjustments: it excludes: 1) stock compensation (share-based payment) expenses and revaluation of contingent consideration; 2) one-time expenses and other non-recurring items; 3) amortisation of IP (but does not exclude amortisation of capitalised software development costs), and; 4) impairments of goodwill and acquired IP\n.\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"PSUs\") which are awarded subject to a three year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\"), which are awarded subject to a three year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two year cliff for other employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 7,457,519 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.7 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 11.4 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDouglas Morin\nCEO\n154,454\n308,908\n463,362\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n119,684\n239,368\n359,052\nTotal\n274,138\n548,276\n822,414\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n2,124,680\n3,324,891\n5,449,571\nOther employees and contractors\n1,185,534\n-\n1,185,534\nTotal\n3,282,569\n3,324,891\n6,635,105\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2023, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2024. All PSUs vest after three years. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees. In addition to the vesting cliffs, the LTIP shares are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award, and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the 2025 Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award.\nThe metrics in the table below apply to actual 2025 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2025:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CEO and CFO, require at least 60% of the 2025 EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the LTIP Shares awarded to vest. 2025 EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this only applies to 50% of their RSU grant. These targets do not apply for all other employees.\nIt should be noted that the co-founders of Devolver who are fully employed at the company, including Executive Chairman Harry Miller, without exception, declined to receive any awards under this grant.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

Astroneer is an Expandable Game* title released in 2016, with a proven history of player retention and engagement through regular content releases and updates. To-date Astroneer has generated over $87 million\nof gross revenues and has been played by over 13 million people.\nAcquisition\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe acquisition represents a strategic opportunity for Devolver to expand outside of its core strength of premium indie titles, leveraging System Era's knowledge of Expandable Game style development, as well as its live operations technology and existing IP.\n\u00b7\nDevolver will capitalise on System Era's development expertise in creating quality, community-centred, long-life titles, which it has proven through the success of its debut title Astroneer, a game that in 2022 achieved its highest annual unit sales figures\n\u00b7\nThe Acquisition adds Astroneer to the Group's current portfolio of high-quality intellectual property, alongside future titles System Era develops.\n\u00b7\nSystem Era's founding team comes from AAA backgrounds, having held senior positions at Ubisoft and Microsoft, working on franchises such as Halo, Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs, and have instilled a strong team culture that aligns with Devolver Digital.\n\u00b7\nTotal consideration of up to US$40 million is to be satisfied by US$22 million initial consideration, made up of US$20 million cash on closing and US$2 million of shares and cash to be issued on the 12-month anniversary of closing, as well as US$10 million deferred consideration, and up to US$8 million potential earn out, both payable in cash and shares. Further detail is provided below.\n\u00b7\nUnder Devolver's accounting policies, based on an estimated restatement of System Era management's unaudited numbers, System Era generated revenue of approximately US$7 million, and adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (\"EBITDA\") of approximately US$3.8 million, in the preceding 12-months to 30 June 2023.\n\u00b7\nUnder Devolver's accounting policies the Acquisition is expected to contribute positively to EBITDA in the year ending 31 December 2024, being the first full year of ownership.\nDouglas Morin, Chief Executive Officer of Devolver Digital, said:\n\"\nThe thing that excites me the most about System Era is the cultural and strategic fit with Devolver. This is a highly experienced, talented group of developers who come with a proven hit, Astroneer, in its eighth year. Their know-how in Expandable Games development opens up a new player-base and revenue stream for Devolver. We are looking forward to bringing the fun to new players in new, innovative ways - and above all welcoming the team to Devolver in coming days and months.\"\nBrendan Wilson, Chief Executive Officer of System Era, said:\n\"Devolver and System Era have been mutual admirers for a long time. We've always seen Devolver's banner as a mark of quality, but they also represent an approach to developing and publishing games that is unique in the industry. Their developer-first orientation lets bold and unorthodox ideas thrive. We're thrilled to be joining into a confederation of like-minded people where System Era's games will get the support needed to reach global audiences, and our developers will continue to work within the culture they love.\"\n* Expandable Games refers to premium games that continue to engage the community and bring in new players for years after rel",

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nDevolver Digital, Inc.\n(\"Devolver Digital\", \"Devolver\" or the \"Company\", and the Company together with all of its subsidiary undertakings \"the Devolver Group\")\nTrading Update\nDevolver Digital, an award-winning digital publisher and developer of indie video games, announces a trading update for the six months to 30 June 2023, and updated guidance for the current financial year ending 31 December 2023.\nOur expectation for performance for 2023 has been impacted by three key factors: delays to new title releases, a reduction in revenue from subscription deals and a lower contribution from our back-catalogue.\nOur strategy is to maximise the appeal and success of new titles by increasing investment in development, quality control and marketing. While critical to our long-term growth, prioritising quality to meet the standards and performance expected of Devolver titles is resulting in delays, higher costs and greater complexity for new releases. As such\nThe Plucky Squire\n, a title that has been tracking well with audiences, will now be released in 2024. It joins other titles previously earmarked for release in 2023, such as\nAnger Foot\n,\nPepper Grinder\nand\nStick It to the Stickman,\nwhich were flagged earlier in 2023 as delayed in order to continue value-add production to further improve their chances of success and longevity. Devolver released one major title in 1H 2023, the award-winning\nTerra Nil\n. In the second half of 2023, we expect to release\nWizard with a Gun\nand\nThe Talos Principle 2,\nas well as other titles in Q4 2023.\nAfter a period of strong contribution during COVID, we have turned down some subscription deal proposals in 2023 that we felt did not adequately recognise the value of our titles. While subscription deals with key platforms remain a part of our long-term growth strategy, the management team has declined several weaker propositions from major platform partners as we felt they undervalued the proposed games' value and revenue opportunity in 2023 and 2024. We expect this trend of reduced revenues from subscription deals to continue in 2024, compared to the period of heightened subscription revenues in 2021 and 2022.\nBack-catalogue sales have been softer following the weaker performance of three key title releases in 2022, except for\nCult of the Lamb\nwhich has continued to perform strongly. As highlighted earlier in 2023, a weaker overall economic environment continues to soften back-catalogue momentum year-to-date.\nIn light of the performance year-to-date we expect Normalised Adjusted EBITDA1 to be negative in the first half of 2023. For the full year ending 31 December 2023, we now expect Group Normalised Adjusted EBITDA to be at least break-even. The Board expects Normalised Adjusted EBITDA to return to growth in 2024 and accelerate in 2025.\nDevolver has a robust balance sheet with c.US$64m net cash on hand as at end June 2023, which takes into account a c.US$7m purchase of shares in the market in 1H 2023, which are now held in Devolver's Employee Benefit Trust.\nDevolver will provide further details on trading in its half year results announcement, which is expected to be released in September 2023.\nHarry Miller, Executive Chairman of Devolver Digital, said:\n\"We are disappointed that 2023 performance will be lower than expected, as we see an impact from delays to new titles, fewer subscription deals and weaker back-catalogue revenues. We want to ensure that we invest the right amount of time, effort and money into our titles as the best way to do justice to our healthy pipeline of releases scheduled for the next 24 months. We continue to look for ways to improve our return from the back-catalogue, as well as taking the right steps to maximise revenues from our new releases.\nWe have seen a strong showing for upcoming Devolver titles at the PlayStation Showcase 2023 in May, and have secured exciting longer-term title wins such as Human Fall Flat 2. We are focusing on our programme to translate the benefits of greater scale and quality into improved revenues and margins beyond 2023, expecting a return to growth in 2024 and 2025.\nAs we work towards these long-term goals, we will pursue a capital allocation strategy that reflects our faith in the long-term strategy of the business. We look forward to updating the market on our progress in the coming months.\"\n-ENDS-\nNotes\n1.\nNormalised adjusted EBITDA excludes: 1) stock compensation (share-based payment) exp",

From the game release perspective, we saw a stronger second half with the stand-out success of Cult of the Lamb and Return to Monkey Island. Our 2H 2022 EBITDA, pre impairments, was the highest ever six-month performance for Devolver, excluding 2020's Fall Guys. At the same time, we underwent a group-wide, title-by-title assessment of commercial viability, carrying value and future prospects. We cancelled some titles, restructured Good Shepherd, and made impairments to IP and Goodwill, reflecting the current lower sector valuations compared to the highs of 2021.

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

I'm no gaming expert! Enter the Gungeon 2 and Fall Flat 2 don't have release date yet so might not even be 2026, and EITR says 'soon' but who knows what that means. So a bit of a mixed bag?

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

I'm no gaming expert! Enter the Gungeon 2 and Fall Flat 2 don't have release date yet so might not even be 2026, and EITR says 'soon' but who knows what that means. So a bit of a mixed bag?

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

Enter the Gungeon 2 will be a hit since the original is one of the best seller Roguelike, Human Fall Flat 2 is another top sequel from a well selling game. Then you have Skate Story and Botsu (Fall guys voxel type game) coming out which both have potential to gain traction and oversell. I like Devolver here with their upcoming catalogue.

I've been thinking that the idea of having industry insiders with contacts go directly to IP holders (where that IP is not currently being utilised - so low risk to impact big ongoing projects) with offers from great independent developers who are enthusiastic about creating games with that IP, has the potential to result in some amazing deals down the line. Attention grabbing IPs combined with the ramp in productivity small dev teams can gain from AI helping them code and develop faster, I'm quite excited about how fast this company might grow. https://www.bigfangames.com/",

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

Enter the Gungeon 2 will be a hit since the original is one of the best seller Roguelike, Human Fall Flat 2 is another top sequel from a well selling game. Then you have Skate Story and Botsu (Fall guys voxel type game) coming out which both have potential to gain traction and oversell. I like Devolver here with their upcoming catalogue. A lot of room for upward surprises",

I've been thinking that the idea of having industry insiders with contacts go directly to IP holders (where that IP is not currently being utilised - so low risk to impact big ongoing projects) with offers from great independent developers who are enthusiastic about creating games with that IP, has the potential to result in some amazing deals down the line. Attention grabbing IPs combined with the ramp in productivity small dev teams can gain from AI helping them code and develop faster, I'm quite excited about how fast this company might grow. https://www.bigfangames.com/",

          "content": "Thanks SmallHex. Sounds like you know the space pretty well - what do you use to get your estimates of sales etc? SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

Then you have Skate Story and Botsu (Fall guys voxel type game) coming out which both have potential to gain traction and oversell. I like Devolver here with their upcoming catalogue.

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

Enter the Gungeon 2 will be a hit since the original is one of the best seller Roguelike, Human Fall Flat 2 is another top sequel from a well selling game. Then you have Skate Story and Botsu (Fall guys voxel type game) coming out which both have potential to gain traction and oversell. I like Devolver here with their upcoming catalogue.

I've been thinking that the idea of having industry insiders with contacts go directly to IP holders (where that IP is not currently being utilised - so low risk to impact big ongoing projects) with offers from great independent developers who are enthusiastic about creating games with that IP, has the potential to result in some amazing deals down the line. Attention grabbing IPs combined with the ramp in productivity small dev teams can gain from AI helping them code and develop faster, I'm quite excited about how fast this company might grow. https://www.bigfangames.com/",

(AIM: DEVO), an award-winning digital publisher and developer of indie video games, announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31st December 2025. All financial figures relate to that period unless otherwise stated.\n2025 full year performance showed improvement over 2024 with growth in both revenues and Adjusted EBITDA1. Revenue performance in 2H 2025 was strong and in-line with expectations, bolstered by the timing of platform deals and the Steam Publisher Sale in September, resulting in management meeting guidance\nof more than US$100m in full year revenues. Underlying Adjusted EBITDA pre-impairments is expected to reach USD double-digit millions, marginally higher than consensus expectations, while an initial unaudited estimate of impairments for released title underperformance is c. $3.5 million.\nNew games released in 2025 maintained very high-quality levels with a full-year average Metacritic score of 78. Notable successes such as\nMonster Train 2\nreleased by publisher subsidiary Big Fan\n, Stronghold: Crusader\nreleased by subsidiary studio Firefly\n,\nand recent sensation\nBall x Pit\nall garnered high-quality scores and user reviews and collectively bolstered front catalogue revenues. Lower cost titles\nMycopunk\nand\nLook Outside\ngarnered favourable user reviews and performed ahead of expectations. System Era also continued making a solid contribution, with\nAstroneer\nreleasing its second PDLC\nMegatech\nin November 2025.\nDevolver has continued its disciplined approach to cost control, with FY25 operating expenses falling slightly compared to FY24. The Board remain committed to delivering efficiencies across the Group, with a continued focus on cost management going into 2026. Devolver has a robust balance sheet with c.US$36.4 million net cash as of 31 December 2025.\n2026 has started strongly with\nQuarantine Zone: The Last Check\nexceeding expectations in the first weeks of its release, and\nCult of the Lamb\n's highly anticipated PDLC\nWoolhaven\nreceiving rave reviews. Notably, Devolver recorded a historic milestone in January with three titles (\nWoolhaven\n,\nCult of the Lamb\nand\nQuarantine Zone: The Last Check\n) all featuring in the Steam2 Global Best Sellers Top 10 list, the first time in Devolver's history.\nHarry Miller, Chief Executive Officer at Devolver, said\n:\n\"We are pleased to have delivered revenues that grew year-over-year, in a gaming market that was flat overall, and met our guidance in 2025, driven by a string of successful new launches by Devolver and its subsidiary companies. And seeing three Devolver titles ranking in Steam's Top 10 Global Best Sellers is a huge historic milestone for us.\nAn overall solid portfolio performance, coupled with sustained operating cost control, resulted in another year of steady improvement in both revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, a very strong early start to 2026 gives us good momentum to deliver further profit improvement this year.\nThe calculated strategies that we began 3 years ago, including an improved greenlight process, in-house developed technologies, cost cutting, improved store management, among others, continue to lead us out of the trough of 2023. The continued adoption and maturation of these strategies,\u00a0along with cycling through products initiated prior to such efforts, give us visibility to reaching higher sustainable profitability in the coming years.\"\nThe Group will announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.\n-ENDS-\nNotes:\n1.\nAdjusted EBITDA (\"EBITDA\") makes the following adjustments: it excludes: 1) stock compensation (share-based payment) expenses and revaluation of contingent consideration; 2) one-time expenses and other non-recurring items; 3) amortisation of IP (but does not exclude amortisation of capitalised software development costs), and; 4) impairments of goodwill and acquired IP. Title performance impairments are included in Adjusted EBITDA.\n2.\nSteam is the world's largest one-stop-shop platform for gamers to buy, store and play video games.\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP. Devolver has an emphasis on premium games and has published more than 135 titles, with more than 30 titles in the pipeline scheduled for release over the next three years.

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",

Then you have Skate Story and Botsu (Fall guys voxel type game) coming out which both have potential to gain traction and oversell. I like Devolver here with their upcoming catalogue.

SteamDB is the only thing I've come across, but I'm sure there are other platforms out there (eg Playstation Store, Google / Apple store) as well, although relevance would vary depending on the game I'm sure... You're right re Quarantine Zone - looks to be doing great given it was only released yesterday! Peak users up to 29000 which is the 5th highest of all their games. Ball X Pit you're right also, that hit 35000 peak users so was 4th highest of all their games. I should have mentioned the cult of the lamb expansion pack which is being released in a week or so also, which could prove popular as that game was a strong performer... Do you have any views on TinyBuild and their slate. Obvs Kingmakers is a bit of a mystery as to what is going on behind the scenes there and when / if it will be release, but at a glance their slate outside that looks pretty good also?",

It has already in less than 24 hrs has had peak concurrent users of 23800 and is currently the #2 top seller on Stram by revenue. This could of course drop off quickly. The reviews are really good ans all negative reviews refer to bugs which will be easily resolved via patch. Ball x Pit did and is still doing  way better than OK. I estimate about  930k copies sold. It has incredible reviews and getting nominated for awards. Skate Story is also certainly financially successful but nowhere near the other 2. I would say Devo are delighted with the past 3 releases. My only concern is the high guidance of USD $100m revenue for 2025 which they will probably just miss due to the delay of Quarantine Zone till 2026. Saying that Ball x pit certainly beat expectations.  I look forward to a Trading update from the company which I expect will be positive and lets see how Quarantine Zone goes over the next few weeks. I think things are looking very good though",

My concern is that, other than Quarantine Zone due in Nov, the rest of the upcoming games seem to be fairly lowly on Steam wishlists / followers etc. And 2025 games already released seem to have been fairly weak so far? Baby Steps seems to not have much of  a following, and like Plucky Squire perhaps is a disappointment? https://steamdb.info/publisher/Devolver+Digital/?sort=release_desc Maybe I'm missing the point given that 88% of their revenues come from the back catalogue and think all game publishers have benefited from a tailwind as the sector recovers and steam purchases etc grow overall? Just wondering what holders think. Why do you own it? Are there any potential hits? Maybe Quarantine Zone? Seems TinyBuild despite the big rerating over the last week or so at least has a few potential hits in the pipeline over the next 6-12 months, most notably Kingmakers, but also possibly Sand, Streets of Rogue, Ferocious, The King is Watching, Lift etc etc.... What am I missing? Is Devolver less dependent on Steam for sales somehow? (Full disclosure I do own a little bit. Wondering what to expect at half year results in a week or so.)",
