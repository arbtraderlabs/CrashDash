The LTIP awards consist of Performance Stock Units (\"PSUs\") which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and achievement of ambitious financial targets, and Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\"), which are awarded subject to a three-year cliff and financial performance criteria for senior management, and a two-year cliff for other employees with financial performance criteria for senior employees.\nThe Remuneration Committee recommended the following awards to the Board, laid out in the tables below. These awards amount to, in aggregate, 8,568,079 shares (on the assumption that all vest), representing 1.8 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital. Total dilution from these awards and all outstanding share options and grants amount to 12.2 per cent. of the issued and outstanding share capital.\nThe following awards have been made to Directors of the Company:\nNumber of shares\nDirector/PDMR\nPosition\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nDaniel Widdicombe\nCFO\n153,333\n306,667\n460,000\nTotal\n153,333\n306,667\n460,000\nThe following awards have been made to other management and employees of the Group:\nNumber of shares\nCategory\nRSUs\nPSUs\nTotal\nOther management and senior employees\n2,571,499\n3,590,487\n6,161,986\nOther employees and contractors\n1,946,093\n-\n1,946,093\nTotal\n4,517,592\n3,590,487\n8,108,079\nThe effective date for the award of these LTIP shares is 1st January 2024, i.e. shares with a two-year cliff will vest on 31st December 2025. All PSUs vest after three years, on 31st December 2026. RSUs vest after three years for senior management and two years for other employees.\nIn addition to the vesting cliffs, the LTIP shares are subject to a range of further vesting conditions specified at the time of award and will lapse if these\u00a0conditions are not met. For the PSUs, these include the following performance conditions:\n(i) the attainment of specified Group revenue targets at the end of a three-year period, and;\n(ii) the attainment of specified Group EBITDA targets at the end of a three-year period.\nThe Company has set challenging financial targets for the PSUs, based upon the Group's internal budgets. Targets are based on organic growth only and exclude any potential M&A uplift.\u00a0The PSUs only begin to be earned once 90% of the Revenue and EBITDA targets are achieved, and management need to deliver at least 110% of the target to realise the full award. The metrics in the table below, which are applicable to PSUs only, apply to actual 2026 Group performance versus the prescribed targets for revenue and EBITDA in 2026:\nMetric\nWeighting\n0% Vesting (Below Threshold)\n12.5% Vesting(Threshold)\n50% Vesting (Target)\n100% Vesting (Maximum)\nRevenue\n50%\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nEBITDA\n50%\n90% of target\nTarget\n110%+ of target\nThe RSUs for senior management, including the CFO, require at least 60% of the EBITDA target to be achieved in order for any of the LTIP Shares awarded to vest. EBITDA performance below this target level will result in all the RSU awards for senior management lapsing. For other management and senior employees, this performance target only applies to 50% of their RSU grant. No performance targets are applied to RSUs granted to all other employees.\nThe co-founders of Devolver who are\u00a0full-time employees at the company, CEO Harry Miller, COO Graeme Struthers and CMO Nigel Lowrie, have not received any awards under the LTIP\u00a0since the LTIP's launch in 2022. This year the Board has instead awarded them a performance-linked\u00a0cash\u00a0bonus based on the same targets\u00a0and timing\u00a0as the\u00a02024\u00a0LTIP\u00a0awards\n.\n-ENDS-\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.

The Circular outlining the proposed resolutions will be posted on the Company's website later today and contains the notice convening the Special Meeting and instructions to shareholders on how to vote at the Special Meeting.\nBackground to and reasons for the Special Meeting\nDevolver has approximately 270 employees worldwide in total. There are 148 outstanding grants of options and warrants made to 100 recipients pursuant to the Devolver Digital, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"\n2017 Plan\n\") (or in respect of warrants, made under a stand-alone agreement on substantially the same terms as the 2017 Plan). Of these grants, 133 are 'underwater', with exercise prices per Share of \u00a30.31 to \u00a30.33 and \u00a30.50 that are above the Current VWAP of \u00a30.27 (the \"\nUnderwater Stock Options\n\" and \"\nUnderwater Warrants\n\").\nThe Board wishes to re-set the Company's equity incentive arrangements with the aim of re-incentivising staff across the Group to support the forward trajectory of the Company and build on the work over the last 18 months. The Board intends to do this in three ways:\nProposals in respect of the 2017 Plan and the Underwater Warrants\n: the Board intends to make an offer to stock option holders and warrant holders to amend the terms of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants (as such terms are described in the Circular), as follows:\na. repricing the exercise price of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants to align with the prevailing fair market value of the Shares;\nb. reducing the overall quantum of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants (reduced by: (i) c. 15 per cent. for those holders who were granted stock options or warrants with an exercise price between \u00a30.31 and \u00a30.33; and (ii) 30 per cent. for those holders who were granted stock options or warrants with an exercise price of \u00a30.50 (but in each case subject to the adjustments further described in the Circular);\nc. resetting the exercise period of the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants to 10 years from the date when these amendments become effective; and\nd.\namending the leaver provisions which apply to the Underwater Stock Options and Underwater Warrants (as more particularly described in the Circular).\nProposals in respect of the Devolver Digital, Inc 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan\")\n: the Board does not intend to make any changes to any awards made under this plan and shall also retain the existing 2022 Plan so that it might make future awards subject to key performance conditions and targets thereunder.\nProposals in respect of the adoption of a new Devolver Digital, Inc 2025 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2025 Plan\")\n: the Board intends to adopt a new 2025 Plan so that it might make awards thereunder. Subject to Shareholder approval, it is proposed that the awards to be made under the 2025 Plan will comprise one-off stock option grants to certain key senior employees.\nAccordingly, the purpose of the Special Meeting is to ask Shareholders to:\n\u00b7\nResolution 1\n: approve the amendments described in the Circular to the terms of the Underwater Stock Options and the Underwater Warrants\n\u00b7\nResolution 2\n: approve the terms of the Company's new 2025 Plan\n\u00b7\nResolution 3\n: grant authority to allot Shares and\ngrant rights over Shares pursuant to the Plans\nRecommendations\nThe Directors believe that the resolutions will promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the Special Meeting, as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings, amounting to (in aggregate)\n128,423,371\nShares, representing\n27.1\nper cent. of the Issued and Outstanding Share Capital of the Company at the date of this document.\nCapitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement have the meanings given to them in the Circular posted on the Company's website earlier today:\nhttps://investors.devolverdigital.com/\nAbout Devolver Digital\nDevolver is an award-winning video games publisher in the indie games space with a balanced portfolio of third-party and own-IP.
