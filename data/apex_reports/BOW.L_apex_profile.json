Trading stabilised during the final quarter of FY25 and the Group's restaurants had a successful four weeks in the run up to Christmas, with some restaurants experiencing record trading. Group revenue for the four weeks ended 28 December 2025 rose by over 1.3% on a like-for-like basis, and this was an encouraging end to the year. The Company expects to report FY25 results in line with current market expectations.\nIn September 2025 \u00a310.1m of new funds (before expenses) were raised and David Page was appointed as Executive Chairman and Nick Wong was appointed as CFO. The Company was also renamed \"Bow Street Group plc\", which completed the trio of a new name, a recapitalised balance sheet and a revitalised team. A comprehensive review of the Group's estate immediately commenced following the fundraising and over 280 work streams have been set up to improve performance in all areas of the business. The Company expects to realise the benefits of this review in the coming year.\nThe current estate has a mixture of long leases and short/very short leases and each restaurant will be judged on its merits and performance. Further to the review outlined above, an agreement has been reached in connection with the lease at Gerrards Cross, which has been assigned to the landlord for a substantial premium. This restaurant was marginally profitable at the EBITDA level (before rent amortisation) and would have required an outlay in excess of \u00a3150,000 to refurbish. The net result for the Group is a major positive in cash terms.\nThe Company is also introducing new targeted incentive schemes for the Group's employees and a share option scheme over approximately 200 million ordinary shares for 105 team members (including the executive directors) was instituted in December 2025.\nLooking forward to 2026, refurbishments of an initial six restaurants are underway; a new menu design will be trialled in February 2026; and new dishes are being launched across the estate. The investments and new menus will help the Group adapt to the increases in National Minimum Wage and Business Rates from April 2026. The early trading performance of, and customer growth at, the refurbished restaurants such as York, Ely and Billericay has been encouraging.\nThe Group is in positive discussions with several potential acquisition targets and will update on the progress of these negotiations in due course.\nDavid Page, Executive\u00a0Chairman of Bow Street Group, commented:\n\"2025\u00a0was an important year for the Group as we\u00a0completed a fundraise that will enable Bow Street to execute a revised strategy to create shareholder value based on improving the performance of the estate and delivering acquisitions of exciting\u00a0and scalable restaurant brands.\n\"During recent months we have conducted a thorough review of the Group's operations and have identified a number of areas for improvement. We have already started to implement some of these improvements and were pleased to see an uplift in trading in the run up to Christmas. Special mention should go to the Lincoln and Maidstone Wildwood restaurants and the Winchester\u00a0dim\u00a0t\u00a0site,\u00a0where exceptionally large numbers of customers were served.\n\"We are in active discussions with several potential acquisition targets spanning European and Asian cuisine. Looking forward to 2026, it will be a year of rebuilding, refreshment and transformation for Bow Street.\"\nFor further information, contact:\nBow Street Group plc\nTel: 020 7637 1166\nDavid Page - Executive Chairman\nJonny Plant - Chief Executive Officer\nNick Wong - Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nMatt Goode / George Lawson / Trisyia Jamaludin - Corporate Finance\nDale Bellis / Harriet Ward - Sales and Corporate Broking\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nNick Naylor / Piers Shimwell - Corporate Finance\nJos Pinnington - Sales and Corporate Broking\nHudson Sandler\n(Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7796 4133\nbowstreetgroup@hudsonsandler.com\nAlex Brennan / Harry Griffiths / Jackson Redley\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Trading stabilised during the final quarter of FY25 and the Group's restaurants had a successful four weeks in the run up to Christmas, with some restaurants experiencing record trading. Group revenue for the four weeks ended 28 December 2025 rose by over 1.3% on a like-for-like basis, and this was an encouraging end to the year. The Company expects to report FY25 results in line with current market expectations.\nIn September 2025 \u00a310.1m of new funds (before expenses) were raised and David Page was appointed as Executive Chairman and Nick Wong was appointed as CFO. The Company was also renamed \"Bow Street Group plc\", which completed the trio of a new name, a recapitalised balance sheet and a revitalised team. A comprehensive review of the Group's estate immediately commenced following the fundraising and over 280 work streams have been set up to improve performance in all areas of the business. The Company expects to realise the benefits of this review in the coming year.\nThe current estate has a mixture of long leases and short/very short leases and each restaurant will be judged on its merits and performance. Further to the review outlined above, an agreement has been reached in connection with the lease at Gerrards Cross, which has been assigned to the landlord for a substantial premium. This restaurant was marginally profitable at the EBITDA level (before rent amortisation) and would have required an outlay in excess of \u00a3150,000 to refurbish. The net result for the Group is a major positive in cash terms.\nThe Company is also introducing new targeted incentive schemes for the Group's employees and a share option scheme over approximately 200 million ordinary shares for 105 team members (including the executive directors) was instituted in December 2025.\nLooking forward to 2026, refurbishments of an initial six restaurants are underway; a new menu design will be trialled in February 2026; and new dishes are being launched across the estate. The investments and new menus will help the Group adapt to the increases in National Minimum Wage and Business Rates from April 2026. The early trading performance of, and customer growth at, the refurbished restaurants such as York, Ely and Billericay has been encouraging.\nThe Group is in positive discussions with several potential acquisition targets and will update on the progress of these negotiations in due course.\nDavid Page, Executive\u00a0Chairman of Bow Street Group, commented:\n\"2025\u00a0was an important year for the Group as we\u00a0completed a fundraise that will enable Bow Street to execute a revised strategy to create shareholder value based on improving the performance of the estate and delivering acquisitions of exciting\u00a0and scalable restaurant brands.\n\"During recent months we have conducted a thorough review of the Group's operations and have identified a number of areas for improvement. We have already started to implement some of these improvements and were pleased to see an uplift in trading in the run up to Christmas. Special mention should go to the Lincoln and Maidstone Wildwood restaurants and the Winchester\u00a0dim\u00a0t\u00a0site,\u00a0where exceptionally large numbers of customers were served.\n\"We are in active discussions with several potential acquisition targets spanning European and Asian cuisine. Looking forward to 2026, it will be a year of rebuilding, refreshment and transformation for Bow Street.\"\nFor further information, contact:\nBow Street Group plc\nTel: 020 7637 1166\nDavid Page - Executive Chairman\nJonny Plant - Chief Executive Officer\nNick Wong - Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nMatt Goode / George Lawson / Trisyia Jamaludin - Corporate Finance\nDale Bellis / Harriet Ward - Sales and Corporate Broking\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nNick Naylor / Piers Shimwell - Corporate Finance\nJos Pinnington - Sales and Corporate Broking\nHudson Sandler\n(Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7796 4133\nbowstreetgroup@hudsonsandler.com\nAlex Brennan / Harry Griffiths / Jackson Redley\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These funds will allow the Board to refurbish the existing estate, where needed, and update the property portfolio as appropriate.

David and Nick have 52 and 21 years of restaurant experience respectively.\n\u00b7\nThe Group acquired The Ventnor Bay Company Limited (\"VBC\"), a private investment vehicle controlled by David Page and Nick Wong at net cash value.

We have a stronger balance sheet and a new strategy which involves enhancing and refurbishing the existing estate, investing in the Wildwood and dim t brands, upgrading technology, and delivering acquisitions of successful scalable restaurant businesses.\n\"I am excited to have joined the Group earlier in September alongside Nick. We are working closely with Jonny and the rest of the team and moving quickly to deliver our plans that will generate value for the Group's shareholders.\"\nJonny Plant, Chief Executive of Bow Street Group, said:\n\"\nDuring the first half of the year, the Group's revenue was impacted by the well-publicised external pressures impacting across the casual dining sector, as well as the effect of our restructuring plan which meant that we traded from five fewer restaurants at the Period end compared to the prior year. Against this backdrop, we have been firmly focused on driving efficiencies to offset cost inflation and protect EBITDA.\n\"We enter the second half of the year in a much stronger position than we have been in for several years. I am delighted to be working closely with David and Nick, who have a formidable track record in the hospitality sector, as we deliver the revised growth strategy. It is an exciting time for Bow Street Group, with our stronger balance sheet giving us the opportunities to invest in our brands and estate, which in turn will allow us to deliver a better experience to customers and ultimately achieve sustainable, profitable growth.\"\nFor further information, contact:\nBow Street Group plc\nTel: 020 7637 1166\nDavid Page - Executive Chairman\nJonny Plant - Chief Executive Officer\nNick Wong - Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nKaty Birkin / George Lawson / Trisyia Jamaludin - Corporate Finance\nDale Bellis / Harriet Ward - Sales and Corporate Broking\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nNick Naylor / Piers Shimwell - Corporate Finance\nJos Pinnington - Sales and Corporate Broking\nHudson Sandler\n(Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7796 4133\nbowstreetgroup@hudsonsandler.com\nAlex Brennan / Harry Griffiths / Jackson Redley\nChairman's statement\nIntroduction\nI am pleased to announce the Group's unaudited interim results for the 26 weeks ended 29 June 2025 (\"H1 2025\" or the \"Period\").
