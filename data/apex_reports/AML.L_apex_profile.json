In response to these market dynamics, we have taken, and continue to take, proactive steps to strengthen our overall position. Work is underway to review our future product cycle plan with the aim of optimising costs and capital investment whilst continuing to deliver innovative, class leading products to meet customer demands and regulatory requirements.\n\"Our core range of models, supported by recent new derivatives, has never been stronger. Valhalla, our first mid-engined plug-in hybrid, enhances this further and in October we reached a pivotal moment in delivering the first of these landmark supercars. We expect to ramp up Valhalla deliveries during the fourth quarter, which will be instrumental in driving improved sequential Q4 2025 financial performance. More importantly, the planned delivery of around 500 Valhallas in 2026, is expected to bolster our profitability and cash flow for the year ahead, in addition to ongoing cost efficiencies.\"\nLawrence Stroll, Aston Martin Executive Chairman commented:\n\"2025 has brought several unexpected challenges at Aston Martin which the Company, under Adrian's leadership, is actively adapting to. My confidence in the long-term prospects for this iconic British brand and commitment to the Company remains unwavering. The positive reception to all our new core models and the groundbreaking Valhalla, which I've experienced first-hand, will help propel Aston Martin forward in 2026 and beyond.\"\nAston Martin's CEO and CFO will host a\nQ&A\nat 8:30am (GMT) today.

This was as a result of the heightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment impacting demand including the ongoing effect of tariffs, in addition to the planned delivery of fewer Specials. Retail volumes in Q3 2025 were in line with total wholesales.\nAston Martin expects to realise the benefits from its expanded range of new core models and Specials in Q4 2025, and beyond. Core models now include Vanquish Volante with deliveries commencing in Q3 2025 and DBX S, Vantage S and Volante 60th anniversary limited edition models deliveries commencing in Q4 2025 whilst DB12 S deliveries will commence in the first half of 2026. The significant milestone of delivering the first of the 999 Valhallas was achieved in October following homologation approvals being received in Europe. The Group expects to deliver c. 150 Valhallas in Q4 2025, assuming no impact from the current U.S. federal government shutdown or the U.S. tariff quota system.\nDuring this period of continued product evolution, the orderbook for core vehicles has remained unchanged, extending for up to five months. An extensive global programme of Valhalla customer driving events is underway in Q4 2025. This will give current and prospective customers the first opportunity to experience the exceptional performance of Aston Martin's first series production mid-engined hybrid supercar, with over 50% already ordered by customers.\nAs previously announced, volumes across most regions were weaker than expected in Q3 2025. The timing of various model transitions and deliveries across the regions over the past year also impacted Q3 2025 volumes when compared to the prior year period. Demand in China remained extremely subdued in line with other luxury automotive peers due to the ongoing weak macroeconomic environment and changes to the luxury car tariff effective from the end of July 2025.\nRevenue and Average Selling Price (ASP) summary\n\u00a3m\nYTD 2025\nYTD 2024\n% change\nQ3 2025\nQ3 2024\n% change\nSale of vehicles\n654.7\n913.4\n(28%)\n255.5\n364.6\n(30%)\nTotal ASP (\u00a3k)\n194\n250\n(22%)\n178\n222\n(20%)\nCore ASP (\u00a3k)\n186\n178\n4%\n177\n177\n0%\nSale of parts\n67.3\n64.6\n4%\n22.6\n21.8\n4%\nServicing of vehicles\n9.1\n8.8\n3%\n3.4\n2.5\n36%\nBrand and motorsport\n8.5\n7.8\n9%\n3.7\n2.7\n37%\nTotal revenue\n739.6\n994.6\n(26%)\n285.2\n391.6\n(27%)\nYTD 2025 revenue decreased by 26% to \u00a3740m (YTD 2024: \u00a3995m), due to the impact of fewer core volumes and, as expected, lower Special deliveries compared to the prior year. While total ASP decreased by 22%, again reflecting fewer Specials, core ASP increased 4%, benefitting from the next generation core derivatives, including the flagship Vanquish and Vanquish Volante. Demand for unique product personalisation continued to drive strong contribution to core revenue YTD 2025 of c. 18%, broadly in line with prior year period.\nCore ASP of \u00a3177k in Q3 2025 was lower sequentially (Q2 2025: \u00a3191k) due to foreign exchange movements, with the U.S. dollar in particular weakening compared to GBP sterling, and support for dealers.\nIncome statement summary\n\u00a3m\nYTD 2025\nYTD 2024\nQ3 2025\nQ3 2024\nRevenue\n739.6\n994.6\n285.2\n391.6\nCost of sales\n(530.2)\n(617.7)\n(202.4)\n(247.6)\nGross profit\n209.4\n376.9\n82.8\n144.0\nGross margin %\n28.3%\n37.9%\n29.0%\n36.8%\nAdjusted operating expenses\n(381.5)\n(498.4)\n(133.4)\n(165.7)\nof which depreciation & amortisation\n179.8\n234.4\n61.3\n72.4\nAdjusted EBIT\n2\n(172.1)\n(121.5)\n(50.6)\n(21.7)\nAdjusting operating items\n(18.7)\n(11.3)\n(5.5)\n(5.0)\nOperating loss\n(190.8)\n(132.8)\n(56.1)\n(26.7)\nNet financing (expense)/income\n(61.9)\n(96.1)\n(55.8)\n14.5\nof which adjusting financing income/ (expense)\n3.0\n(19.2)\n0.5\n3.1\nLoss before tax\n(252.7)\n(228.9)\n(111.9)\n(12.2)\nTax (charge)/ credit\n(27.8)\n9.2\n(19.9)\n0.1\nLoss for the period\n(280.5)\n(219.7)\n(131.8)\n(12.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\n7.7\n112.9\n10.7\n50.7\nAdjusted EBITDA margin2\n1.0%\n11.4%\n3.8%\n12.9%\nAdjusted loss before tax\n2\n(237.0)\n(198.4)\n(106.9)\n(10.3)\n2\nAlternative Performance Measures are defined in Appendix\nThe lower YTD 2025 revenue, as a result of the decrease in Specials deliveries and core volumes, also impacted gross profit, which decreased to \u00a3209m (YTD 2024: \u00a3377m), resulting in a gross profit margin of 28% (YTD 2024: 38%). This includes the impact of the previously communicated warranty costs and other investments made in product quality. The volume impact was reflected in the Q3 2025 gross margin of 29% (Q3 2024: 37%), as was the previously announced support for dealers in China, ongoing support across other regions and foreign exchange movements compared to the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by \u00a3105m YTD 2025 to \u00a38m (YTD 2024: \u00a3113m) with\nadjusted EBITDA margin declining to 1% (YTD 2024: 11%). This reflects the lower gross profit\n, which was partially offset by a 24% decrease in adjusted operating expenses (excluding D&A). This aligns with the Group's focus on optimising the cost base, as part of its ongoing transformation programme. Operating expenses include the \u00a311m benefit from the revaluation uplift of the secondary warrant option offset by c. \u00a33m fees associated with the disposal of the Group's AMR GP investment. The Group now expects to reduce FY 2025 adjusted operating expenses (excluding D&A) to c. \u00a3275m (FY 2024: \u00a3313m) and to drive further operating leverage through disciplined cost management from 2026 onwards.\nAdjusted EBIT decreased by 42% YTD 2025 to \u00a3(172)m (YTD 2024: \u00a3(122)m) with depreciation and amortisation decreasing by 23% to \u00a3180m (YTD 2024: \u00a3234m), primarily reflecting fewer Specials.\nAdjusted net financing costs of \u00a365m (YTD 2024: \u00a377m), decreased primarily due to the \u00a317m year-on-year impact of non-cash U.S. dollar debt revaluation due to the weaker U.S. dollar.

The largest drivers of the YTD 2025 working capital outflow were:\n\u00b7\nA \u00a378m increase in inventories (YTD 2024: \u00a3108m increase) ahead of commencing delivery of new core derivatives and Valhalla and a \u00a310m decrease in payables (YTD 2024: \u00a38.4m increase)\n\u00b7\nwhich were partially offset by a \u00a343m increase (YTD 2024: \u00a3123m decrease) in deposits held, due to Valhalla deposit collections more than offsetting the deposit outflow from other Special deliveries and flat receivables (YTD 2024: \u00a380m decrease)\nCapital expenditure of \u00a3254m was below the comparative period (YTD 2024: \u00a3300m) and as part of its immediate review on cost and capex, the Group now expects FY 2025 to be c. \u00a3350m. This compares with the original guidance of c. \u00a3400m at the start of the year and c. \u00a3375m as at the Q3 Trading Update. Further, the Group is undertaking actions related to its future product cycle plan that will enable the Group to target a reduction in 5-year capex from c. \u00a32bn to c. \u00a31.7bn. Further details on this will be shared at its 2025 Full Year Results.\nYTD 2025 free cash outflow increased by \u00a321m compared to the comparative period to \u00a3415m (YTD 2024: \u00a3394m outflow), due to the increase in cash outflow from operating activities as detailed above and the increase in net cash interest more than offsetting the reduction in capital expenditure.\n\u00a3m\n30-Sep-25\n31-Dec-24\n30-Sep-24\nLoan notes\n(1,326.5)\n(1,378.9)\n(1,227.4)\nInventory financing\n(38.8)\n(38.4)\n(39.8)\nBank loans and overdrafts\n(170.1)\n(8.4)\n(8.3)\nLease liabilities (IFRS 16)\n(94.4)\n(96.6)\n(97.9)\nGross debt\n(1,629.8)\n(1,522.3)\n(1,373.4)\nCash balance\n247.4\n359.6\n156.9\nCash not available for short term use\n1.4\n0.0\n0.0\nNet debt\n(1,381.0)\n(1,162.7)\n(1,216.5)\nCompared with 31 December 2024, gross debt increased to \u00a31,630m (31 December 2024: \u00a31,522m) as a result of drawing on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nTotal cash and available facilities were \u00a3248m on 30 September 2025 marginally improved compared with \u00a3228m on 30 June 2025, with the free cash outflow in the period more than offset by the c. \u00a3106m inflow of net proceeds following the completed sale of AMR GP shares.\nNet debt of \u00a31,381m at 30 September 2025 increased from \u00a31,163m as at 31 December 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the cash balance and increase in banks loans and overdrafts. The adjusted net leverage ratio of 8.3x (30 September 2024: 4.2x) reflects the increase in net debt and YTD decline in adjusted EBITDA.\nOutlook: Now reflects immediate actions taken following Q3 Trading Update\n(on 6 October 2025)\nThe global macroeconomic environment facing the wider automotive industry remains challenging. This includes uncertainties over the economic impact from U.S. tariffs and the implementation of the quota mechanism, changes to China's ultra-luxury car taxes and the increased potential for supply chain pressures, particularly following the recent cyber incident at a major UK automotive manufacturer.\nQ4 2025 is expected to deliver improved sequential financial performance, supported by increased core volumes driven by new derivatives in addition to the accretive financial contribution from the initial deliveries of Valhalla. The Group expects total wholesale volumes in FY 2025 to decline by mid-to-high single digit percentage compared to the prior year (FY 2024: 6,030).\nAs previously reported, the Group expects FY 2025 adjusted EBIT to be below the lower end of the range of market consensus available prior to the 6 October 2025 Trading Update (consensus adjusted EBIT low end range: \u00a3(110)m). This was driven by the weaker volumes and pressure on the gross margin per vehicle. The Group expects sequential gross margin improvement in Q4 2025 resulting in FY 2025 gross margin in the low 30s%.\nFY 2025 capex is now expected to reduce to c. \u00a3350m (previously c. \u00a3375m as at the Q3 Trading Update, and c. \u00a3400m as at the start of the year) with a further reduction in\nadjusted operating expenses (excluding D&A)\nto c. \u00a3275m (FY 2024: \u00a3313m). Notwithstanding these actions, the Group no longer expects to meet its prior guidance of positive free cash flow generation in H2 2025. However, the Group expects free cash outflow to improve sequentially in Q4 2025, including an increase in receivables at the end of the period due to the expected timing of vehicle sales.\nThe Group expects FY 2026 profitability and cash flow to materially improve compared with FY 2025. This will be driven by the contribution from Valhalla deliveries from the start of the year (expected to be c. 500 units in total in FY 2026) in addition to driving improved operating leverage.\nAs part of the immediate actions on costs and capital expenditure, a review of the future product cycle plan is underway. It is expected that this will result in lower capital investment in engineering and development than previously guided down from c. \u00a32bn to c. \u00a31.7bn over the coming 5-year period.\nFor UK automotive manufacturers, the introduction of a U.S. tariff quota mechanism adds a further degree of complexity and limits the Group's ability to accurately forecast for this financial year end and, potentially, quarterly from 2026 onwards.\nThe Group continues to engage with both the U.S. and UK governments to secure greater clarity and certainty. Whilst positive dialogue on this matter has been achieved directly with the U.S. government, the Company continues to seek more proactive support from the UK government to protect the interests of small volume manufacturers, like Aston Martin, who provide thousands of jobs, making an important contribution to local economies and to the wider UK automotive supply chain.\nThe financial information contained herein is unaudited.\nAll metrics and commentary in this announcement exclude adjusting items unless stated otherwise and certain financial data within this announcement have been rounded.\nEnquiries\nInvestors and Analysts\nJames Arnold Head of Investor Relations +44 (0) 7385 222347\njames.arnold@astonmartin.com\nMaddie Herborn Investor Relations Analyst +44 (0) 7345 000730\nmadeleine.herborn@astonmartin.com\nMedia\nKevin Watters Director of Communications +44 (0) 7764 386683\nkevin.watters@astonmartin.com\nFGS Global\nJames Leviton and Jenny Bahr +44 (0) 20 7251 3801\nQ&A details\n\u00b7\nThere will be a Q&A today at 08:30am BST:\nhttps://app.webinar.net/eVW3obWRBLN\n\u00b7\nThe Q&A can be accessed live via the corporate website:\nhttps://www.astonmartin.com/en/corporate/investors/results-and-presentations\n\u00b7\nA replay facility will be available on the website later in the day\nNo representations or warranties, express or implied, are made as to, and no reliance should be placed on, the accuracy, fairness or completeness of the information presented or contained in this release.

The person responsible for releasing this announcement on behalf of the Company is Liz Miles, Company Secretary.\nAston Martin today provides the following Q3 2025 Trading Update and a revision to FY 2025 guidance ahead of its Q3 2025 Results on 29th October 2025.\nAs a result of the heightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment, including the ongoing impact of tariffs, the Company now expects total wholesale volumes in FY 2025 to decline by mid-high single digit percentage when compared to the prior year (FY 2024; 6,030). This revision reflects the Group's continued focus on maintaining a disciplined approach to balancing core wholesales and retail demand in the current trading environment.\nAdditionally, the company confirms that it expects Valhalla deliveries to commence in Q4 2025, with c.150 deliveries forecast in the period. Whilst this is behind prior expectations, it reflects a timing impact, with a smooth delivery profile expected in 2026.\nManagement has initiated an immediate review of future cost and capital expenditure but not withstanding this now expects FY 2025 adjusted EBIT to be below the lower end of the range of market consensus (consensus adjusted EBIT low end: \u00a3(110)m) and no longer expects positive free cash flow generation in H2 2025.\nQ3 2025 Trading Update\nThe Group delivered c. 1,430 wholesale units in Q3 2025, below the previous guidance of being broadly similar to the prior year period (Q3 2024: 1,641). The shortfall was due to weaker than expected demand including in both North America, with the continuing tariff impact, and APAC (including greater China). Q3 2025 retail volumes were in line with wholesales. Q3 2025 financial performance will reflect the impact from fewer than expected wholesale volumes combined with the expected negative mix impact of fewer Special deliveries.\nAston Martin has continued with its launch of new core derivatives, with customer deliveries for the new Vanquish Volante commencing during Q3 2025. In Q4 2025 the Group expects to commence deliveries of the new Vantage S and DBX S, which has received exceptional initial media reviews.\nValhalla entered production in Q3 2025, with a gradual ramp up in volumes planned through to the end of the year. Initial customer deliveries are still expected to commence during Q4 2025, albeit on a marginally delayed timeline linked to completion of vehicle engineering and the finalisation of mandatory homologation approvals. Due to this timing issue, the Group expects to reduce the number of Valhalla wholesales in Q4 2025 to c. 150. Additional risks to the delivery schedule for FY 2025 remain, associated with the current U.S. federal government shutdown potentially impacting final U.S. homologation timing and the ongoing uncertainty created by the U.S. tariff quota system.\nAston Martin completed the sale of shares in AMR GP in Q3 2025, receiving gross proceeds of c. \u00a3108m. This supports the Group's total liquidity, which ended the period at c. \u00a3250m.\nUpdated outlook\nThe global macroeconomic environment facing the industry remains challenging. This includes uncertainties over the economic impact from U.S. tariffs and the implementation of the quota mechanism, changes to China's ultra-luxury car taxes and the increased potential for supply chain pressures, particularly following the recent cyber incident at a major UK automotive manufacturer.\nQ4 2025 is expected to deliver improved sequential financial performance supported by increased core volumes driven by new derivatives in addition to the accretive financial contribution from the initial deliveries of Valhalla. However, the Group no longer expects to meet its previous FY 2025 wholesale volume guidance given Q3 2025 performance and a revised expectation for Q4 2025 wholesales. The latter revision reflects the Group's continued focus on maintaining a disciplined approach to balancing core wholesales and retail demand in the current challenging macroeconomic environment. The Group now expects total wholesale volumes in FY 2025 to decline by mid-to-high single digit percentage compared to the prior year (FY 2024: 6,030) with the majority of the volume adjustment related to the North America and APAC (including Greater China) regions.\nThe Group expects FY 2025 adjusted EBIT to now be below the lower end of the range of market consensus (consensus adjusted EBIT low end: \u00a3(110)m) driven by the weaker volumes and pressure on the gross margin per vehicle. FY 2025 capex is now expected to reduce to c. \u00a3375m (previously c. \u00a3400m) and SG&A remains on track to decline by c. 10% compared to the prior year (FY 2024: \u00a3313m). Notwithstanding these actions, the Group no longer expects to meet its prior guidance of positive free cash flow generation in H2 2025, but does expect free cash flow generation to improve sequentially in Q4 2025.\nThe Group expects FY 2026 profitability and free cash flow generation to materially improve compared with FY 2025. This will be driven by consistent contribution from Valhalla deliveries in addition to ongoing cost reduction programmes benefiting SG&A.\nAn immediate review of future cost and capital expenditures has been initiated by the management team. This will also include a review of the future product cycle plan in response to market and regulatory dynamics. It is expected that this will result in lower capital investment in engineering and development than previously guided (FY 2025 to FY 2029: c. \u00a32bn).\nFor UK automotive manufacturers, the introduction of a U.S. tariff quota mechanism adds a further degree of complexity and limits the Group's ability to accurately forecast for this financial year end and, potentially, quarterly from 2026 onwards.\nThe Group continues to engage with both the U.S. and UK governments to secure greater clarity and certainty.

Our financial performance reflected fewer planned Specials deliveries as we advance towards commencing initial customer deliveries of Valhalla, our first-ever mid-engine PHEV supercar, in Q4 2025. Retail volumes materially outpaced wholesales by over 40%, reflecting our disciplined approach to production and deliveries. We were encouraged by a strong core average selling price in H1 2025, increasing 7% compared to the prior year period. This demonstrates the positive impact of our recently launched range of models, including our V12 Vanquish, and ongoing strong demand for personalisation from our customers\ndriving an 18% contribution to core revenue\n.\n\"The evolving and disruptive U.S. tariff situation was unhelpful to our operations in Q2. In response, we adjusted production and limited imports through April and May while awaiting confirmation of a trade agreement between the UK and the U.S., leveraging existing inventory held by our U.S. dealers in that period. We resumed shipments to the U.S. in June in anticipation of a finalised agreement which came into effect on 30 June 2025. We continue to actively engage the UK government to urge them to improve the quota mechanism to ensure fair access for the whole UK car industry to the 10% rate on an ongoing basis.\n\"Whilst we continue to navigate a complex operating environment, we are excited about the potential of our recently launched Vantage S which joins the DBX S, Vantage Roadster and Vanquish Volante. This gives customers even greater choice across our core range, in addition to our Specials, Valhalla and Valkyrie LM. The volume growth these new models will deliver in H2, combined with the benefits from our transformation programme, unlocking new revenue opportunities and enhancing operational performance, are expected to drive significantly improved financial performance in H2 compared with H1.\"\nAston Martin's management team will host a\nwebcast presentation\nand live Q&A\nat 8am (BST) today.

This reflected a disciplined approach to production and deliveries at the start of 2025, ahead of a planned ramp up in volumes in H2 2025. The limited number of Specials reflects the completion of previous programmes ahead of the eagerly awaited commencement of Valhalla deliveries expected in Q4 2025. Retail volumes in H1 2025, significantly outpaced wholesale volumes by over 40%.\nAston Martin expects to realise the benefits from its full range of new core models and future derivatives as it progresses through H2 2025. These include Vantage Roadster, with deliveries recently commencing in Q2 2025, Vanquish Volante with deliveries commencing in Q3 2025 and the new DBX S and Vantage S with deliveries commencing in Q4 2025. This expanded range of core models is expected to enhance the quality and duration of the order book over time. Currently, the orderbook is stable for core vehicles, extending for up to five months. In addition, the orderbook for Valhalla extends for 12 months with customer specifications ongoing. A strong pipeline of future orders is building following extensive activation events at Monaco, Silverstone and Goodwood in recent weeks ahead of test drives commencing in October.\nAston Martin's volumes remained well balanced across all regions in H1 2025, with the Americas and EMEA excluding UK collectively representing 62% of total wholesales. This was despite the challenges associated with the lower 10% U.S. tariff implementation only coming into effect on 30 June 2025, providing very limited time to wholesale U.S. vehicles. Volumes in APAC decreased 9%, with volumes in China broadly flat compared with H1 2024 reflecting a continued weak macroeconomic environment which is leading to supressed demand and is expected to continue at least in the near-term. UK wholesale volumes increased by 28% which was more than offset by a 20% decline in EMEA due to the timing of model transitions and deliveries.\nRevenue and Average Selling Price (ASP) summary\n\u00a3m\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\n% change\nQ2 2025\nQ2 2024\n% change\nSale of vehicles\n399.2\n548.8\n(27%)\n193.5\n309.2\n(37%)\nTotal ASP (\u00a3k)\n206\n274\n(25%)\n197\n293\n(33%)\nCore ASP (\u00a3k)\n192\n180\n7%\n191\n183\n4%\nSale of parts\n44.7\n42.8\n4%\n22.8\n21.9\n4%\nServicing of vehicles\n5.7\n6.3\n(10%)\n1.9\n2.7\n(30%)\nBrand and motorsport\n4.8\n5.1\n(6%)\n2.3\n1.5\n53%\nTotal revenue\n454.4\n603.0\n(25%)\n220.5\n335.3\n(34%)\nH1 2025 revenue decreased by 25% to \u00a3454m (H1 2024: \u00a3603m), primarily, as guided, due to the decrease in Specials volumes compared to the prior year period. While total ASP decreased by 25%, again reflecting fewer Specials, core ASP increased 7%, benefitting from the next generation core range of vehicles, including the V12 Vanquish. Demand for unique product personalisation continued to drive strong contribution to core revenue of 18%, broadly in line with the prior year period.\nIncome statement summary\n\u00a3m\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nQ2 2025\nQ2 2024\nRevenue\n454.4\n603.0\n220.5\n335.3\nCost of sales\n(327.8)\n(370.1)\n(159.1)\n(202.1)\nGross profit\n126.6\n232.9\n61.4\n133.2\nGross margin %\n27.9%\n38.6%\n27.8%\n39.7%\nAdjusted operating expenses\n(248.1)\n(332.7)\n(118.4)\n(175.9)\nof which depreciation & amortisation\n118.5\n162.0\n58.4\n85.0\nAdjusted EBIT\n2\n(121.5)\n(99.8)\n(57.0)\n(42.7)\nAdjusting operating items\n(13.2)\n(6.3)\n(10.4)\n(4.7)\nOperating loss\n(134.7)\n(106.1)\n(67.4)\n(47.4)\nNet financing (expense)/income\n(6.1)\n(110.6)\n6.2\n(30.5)\nof which adjusting financing income/(expense)\n2.5\n(22.3)\n(0.5)\n4.4\nLoss before tax\n(140.8)\n(216.7)\n(61.2)\n(77.9)\nTax (charge)/credit\n(7.9)\n9.1\n(7.5)\n9.2\nLoss for the period\n(148.7)\n(207.6)\n(68.7)\n(68.7)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\n(3.0)\n62.2\n1.4\n42.3\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n2\n(0.7)%\n10.3%\n0.6%\n12.6%\nAdjusted loss before tax\n2\n(130.1)\n(188.1)\n(50.3)\n(77.6)\n2\nAlternative Performance Measures are defined in Appendix\nThe lower revenue in H1 2025 as a result of the decrease in Specials deliveries impacted gross profit which decreased to \u00a3127m (H1 2024: \u00a3233m). In addition, H1 2025 gross profit was impacted by warranty costs and other investments made in product quality increasing by \u00a320m to \u00a338m (H1 2024: \u00a318m). This includes the previously communicated investment in software and infotainment enhancements, which has resulted in recently elevated customer satisfaction. The combined effects of these meant that gross margin decreased to 28% (H1 2024: 39%).\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by \u00a365m in H1 2025 to \u00a3(3)m (H1 2024: \u00a362m) with adjusted EBITDA margin declining to (1)% (H1 2024: 10%). This reflects the lower gross profit, which was partially offset by a 24% decrease in adjusted operating expenses (excluding D&A) to \u00a3130m (H1 2024: \u00a3171m). The \u00a341m improvement in adjusted operating expenses (excluding D&A) aligns with the Group's focus on optimising the cost base as part of its ongoing transformation programme. The Group's previously announced organisational adjustments, to ensure the business is appropriately resourced for its future plans, are progressing as planned, with the Group on track to deliver a reduction in adjusted operating expenses (excluding D&A) in FY 2025. In addition, operating expenses benefited by \u00a311m from the revaluation uplift of the secondary warrant option associated with the forthcoming sale of the Group's AMR GP investment.\nAdjusted EBIT decreased by 22% in H1 2025 to \u00a3(122)m (H1 2024: \u00a3(100)m) with depreciation and amortisation decreasing by 27% to \u00a3119m (H1 2024: \u00a3162m), primarily reflecting the fewer Specials.\nAdjusted net financing costs of \u00a39m (H1 2024: \u00a388m), decreased primarily due to the \u00a378m year-on-year impact of non-cash U.S. dollar debt revaluations due to the weaker U.S. dollar. H1 2025 net adjusting finance income of \u00a33m relates to movements in the fair value of outstanding warrants. The prior year period net adjusting finance expense of \u00a322m comprised of a redemption premium associated with the refinancing of senior secured notes, partially offset by movements in fair value of outstanding warrants.\nThe adjusted loss before tax reduced by \u00a358m to \u00a3130m (H1 2024: \u00a3188m loss), largely reflecting the decrease in adjusted net finance costs.\nCash flow and net debt summary\n\u00a3m\nH1 2025\nH1 2024\nQ2 2025\nQ2 2024\nCash used in operating activities\n(81.0)\n(71.9)\n(49.9)\n(10.4)\nCash used in investing activities (excl. interest)\n(170.6)\n(200.1)\n(80.8)\n(113.8)\nNet cash interest (paid)/received\n(69.4)\n(40.6)\n(70.0)\n2.0\nFree cash outflow\n2\n(321.0)\n(312.6)\n(200.7)\n(122.2)\nCash inflow from financing and other investing activities (excl. interest)\n91.0\n93.8\n95.9\n65.9\nDecrease in net cash\n(230.0)\n(218.8)\n(104.8)\n(56.3)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(6.0)\n(0.9)\n(4.7)\n(0.6)\nCash balance\n123.6\n172.7\n123.6\n172.7\nAvailable facilities\n104.1\n74.1\n104.1\n74.1\nTotal cash and available facilities (\"liquidity\")\n227.7\n246.8\n227.7\n246.8\n2\nAlternative Performance Measures are defined in Appendix\nNet cash outflow from operating activities increased by \u00a39m in H1 2025 to \u00a381m (H1 2024: \u00a372m outflow), largely reflecting a \u00a365m decrease in adjusted EBITDA, as explained above, offset by a reduced working capital outflow of \u00a345m (H1 2024: \u00a3119m outflow). The largest drivers of working capital outflow in H1 2025 were:\n\u00b7\n\u00a3\n34m decrease in payables following reduction from peak production volumes in Q4 2024 (H1 2024: \u00a339m decrease)\n\u00b7\n\u00a347m increase in inventories (H1 2024: \u00a351m increase) ahead of commencing new core derivatives and Valhalla production\n\u00b7\nwhich were partially offset by a \u00a328m increase (H1 2024: \u00a384m decrease) in deposits held, due to Valhalla deposit collections more than offsetting the deposit outflow from Valiant deliveries and a decrease in receivables of \u00a38m (H1 2024: \u00a355m decrease) relating to Q4 2024 wholesales\nCapital expenditure of \u00a3171m was slightly below the comparative period (H1 2024: \u00a3200m), with investment focused on the future product pipeline set to accelerate in H2 2025.\nFree cash outflow was broadly stable at \u00a3321m in H1 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a3313m outflow), reflecting the increase in net cash interest paid and increase in net cash outflow from operating activities more than offsetting the reduction in capital expenditure. Q2 2025 net cash interest paid of \u00a370m compared with a \u00a32m receipt in the prior year period, reflects the timing of interest paid earlier in Q1 2024 as part of the Group's refinancing.\n\u00a3m\n30 Jun-25\n31 Dec-24\n30 Jun-24\nLoan notes\n(1,310.6)\n(1,378.9)\n(1,140.5)\nInventory financing\n(38.0)\n(38.4)\n(38.9)\nBank loans and overdrafts\n(58.7)\n(8.4)\n(88.1)\nLease liabilities (IFRS 16)\n(94.0)\n(96.6)\n(99.0)\nGross debt\n(1,501.3)\n(1,522.3)\n(1,366.5)\nCash balance\n123.6\n359.6\n172.7\nNet debt\n(1,377.7)\n(1,162.7)\n(1,193.8)\nCompared with 31 December 2024, gross debt marginally decreased to \u00a31,501m (31 December 2024: \u00a31,522m) reflecting the translation benefit of GBP sterling strengthening compared to the U.S. dollar in relation to the Company's U.S. dollar denominated loan notes. As expected, total cash and available facilities decreased to \u00a3228m on 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: \u00a3247m). In Q3 2025, the Group expects to enhance its liquidity position through the c.\u00a3110m gross proceeds from the forthcoming sale of its investment in the Aston Martin Aramco Formula One\u2122 Team.\nNet debt of \u00a31,378m as at 30 June 2025 increased from \u00a31,163m as at 31 December 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the cash balance. The adjusted net leverage ratio of 6.7x (30 June 2024: 4.2x) reflects the increase in net debt and H1 2025 decline in adjusted EBITDA, as the Group prepares to deliver a significantly stronger H2 2025 performance. Through disciplined strategic delivery and profitable growth in the future, the Group expects to deleverage in line with its medium-term target.\nOutlook:\nThe Group continues to expect to deliver a significantly stronger H2 2025 performance compared with H1 2025. Commencing with a quarterly sequential improvement in performance in Q3 2025, it is expected that Q4 2025 will be the primary driver of H2 2025. This is due to the benefits from initial Valhalla and Valkyrie LM deliveries and the contribution from the full range of core models including Vantage Roadster, Vanquish Volante, DBX S and Vantage S. Performance in Q3 2025, is expected to reflect broadly similar wholesale volumes with the negative mix impact of fewer Special deliveries compared to the prior year period.\nWhilst the impact of the recently announced U.S. tariffs on the global economy remains uncertain, several factors have been reflected in a slight revision to some of the Group's FY 2025 guidance. These include the impact from foreign exchange rates movements, increased investment in software and infotainment enhancements and the Group's decisive action to support its dealers in China to reduce stock levels prior to future market improvements.\nFor UK automotive manufacturers, the introduction of a U.S. quota mechanism, published in the Federal Register on 23rd June 2025, and coming into effect on 30th June 2025, adds a further degree of complexity and limits the Group's ability to accurately forecast for this financial year and potentially quarterly from 2026 onwards. Under this mechanism, up to 100,000 UK vehicles can be imported into the U.S. at a 10% tariff in a calendar year, with volumes above that threshold subject to a 27.5% tariff. The quota is currently based on a \"first come first served\" basis with 25,000 UK made vehicles able to qualify for the lower tariff rate each quarter from Q1 2026 and the equivalent amount pro-rated for the 2025 calendar year since being instated.\nThe Company continues to closely monitor global events and will remain agile\nin responding to changes in the external environment\n.\nThe Group also remains vigilant regarding broader risk factors that could influence its plans\n.

Aston Martin fuses the latest technology, time honoured craftsmanship and beautiful styling to produce a range of critically acclaimed luxury models including the Vantage, DB12, Vanquish, DBX and its first hypercar, the Aston Martin Valkyrie. Aligned with its Racing. Green. sustainability strategy, Aston Martin is developing alternatives to the Internal Combustion Engine with a blended drivetrain approach between 2025 and 2030, with a clear plan to have a line-up of electrified sports cars and SUVs.\nBased in Gaydon, England, Aston Martin Lagonda designs, creates, and exports cars which are sold in more than 50 countries around the world. Its sports cars are manufactured in Gaydon with its luxury DBX SUV range proudly manufactured in St Athan, Wales.\nLagonda was founded in 1899 and came together with Aston Martin in 1947 when both were purchased by the late Sir David Brown, and the company is now listed on the London Stock Exchange as Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc.\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nThe principal risks and uncertainties that could substantially affect the Group's business and results were previously reported on pages 58 to 60 of the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts. The Group's risk environment has been reassessed as of 30 June 2025 to consider any significant changes to the Group's previous risk assessment including any new and emerging risks and opportunities.\nThe only change to the principal risks previously disclosed within the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts is the removal of the 'achieving financial and cost-reduction targets' risk. This reflects the fact that this risk is directly linked to the other principal risks with all mitigating controls and activities encapsulated within the risk mitigation plans of the remaining principal risks.\nStrategic risks\nMacro-economic and political instability:\nExposure to multiple political and economic factors could impact customer demand or affect the markets in which we operate.\nThe Group operates in the ultra-luxury segment (ULS) vehicle market and accordingly its performance is linked to market conditions and consumer demand in that market. Sales of ULS vehicles are affected by general economic conditions and can be materially affected by the economic cycle. Demand for luxury goods, including ULS vehicles, is volatile and depends to a large extent on the general economic, political, and social conditions in a given market. Furthermore, economic slowdowns in the past have significantly affected the automotive and related markets. Periods of deteriorating general economic conditions may result in a significant reduction in ULS vehicle sales, which may put downward pressure on the Group's product and service prices and volumes and negatively affect profitability. These effects may have a more pronounced effect on the Group's business, due to the relatively small scale of its operations and its limited product range.\nDuring the first half of the year the implementation of increased U.S. import tariffs on vehicles manufactured outside of North America became a material risk. Increased tariffs can adversely affect demand for certain models, disrupt established distribution flows and increase the Group's cost base in a strategically critical market. To mitigate this the Group is actively engaging with policy and industry stakeholders, while also reviewing contingency plans, including supply chain adjustments and pricing strategies, to mitigate the potential impacts.\nThe Group is also exposed to changes in Government policy in areas such as vehicle electrification, trade and the environment, for example in relation to the trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union or through changes in emissions legislation. We continue to monitor macro-economic indicators and geopolitical development closely, maintaining a disciplined approach to scenario planning, cost and liquidity management. Whilst these external conditions remain uncertain, the Group is well positioned to respond with agility and resilience.\nBrand / reputational damage:\nOur brand and reputation are critical in securing demand for our vehicles and in developing additional revenue streams.\nThe Group's success depends on the preservation and enhancement of our brand and reputation with ultra-luxury consumers. In the first half of the year, heightened public and regulatory scrutiny across ESG performance, AI ethics and supply chain transparency has intensified reputational risk exposure. Negative sentiment can amplify quickly across global media and social platforms, with potential to influence consumer behaviour and investor sentiment.\nThe Group continues to invest in brand stewardship, customer engagement, and ESG governance, while reinforcing internal controls and crisis response protocols. We also promote brand awareness and identity through our marketing activity, leveraging the global reach of the Aston Martin Aramco Formula OneTM Team. We continue to pursue our 'build to order' strategy, which combined with the positive impact of our fixed marketing activity is driving brand exclusivity.\nTechnological advancement:\nIt is essential to maintain pace with technological development to meet evolving customer expectation, remain competitive and stay ahead of regulatory requirements.\nTo remain competitive the Group needs to consider the latest technologies (e.g. electrification, active safety, connected car, autonomous driving) for future use in its products and keep pace with the transition to electrified and lower emission powertrains. Strategic agreements with key suppliers, including Lucid and Mercedes Benz AG provide access to technology that may otherwise be too costly to develop internally.\nOperational risks\nTalent acquisition and retention:\nWe may fail to attract, retain, engage and develop a productive workforce or develop key talent.\nAttracting, developing and retaining world-class talent remains critical to delivering our strategic objectives, particularly as the industry undergoes rapid transformation across electrification, digitalisation, and AI integration. The global competition for specialist skills, notably in software, battery technology, and advance manufacturing continues to intensify, placing upward pressure on talent costs and increasing the risk of capability gaps. Failure to attract or retain the right talent could impact our innovation pipeline, execution pace, and cultural alignment\nThe Group remains focussed on building an agile, inclusive, and high-performance culture.\nWe continue to monitor workforce sentiment through regular listening mechanisms, including the Great Place to Work survey, and maintain focus on strengthening strategic workforce planning to ensure the organisation is positioned to meet future capability needs.\nQuality:\nPoor quality could damage our brand and reputation and adversely affect our ability to generate demand or achieve our financial targets.\nThe Group is committed to the highest standards of engineering, craftsmanship, and customer satisfaction. As an ultra-luxury automotive OEM, any deviation in quality, whether in vehicle components, software functionality, or aftersales performance, can materially impact brand reputation, customer loyalty, and financial performance. The increasing complexity of drivetrains connected systems and software updates increases the risk associated with quality. To mitigate this the Group continues to invest in quality governance which includes the Customer Perception Audit process, AML Parts Approval Process and a Quality led production ramp-up for new vehicle programmes managed through the Product Creation Delivery System.\nProgramme delivery:\nFailure to implement major programmes on time, within budget and to the right technical and quality specification could jeopardise delivery of our strategy and have significant adverse financial and reputational consequences.\nThe Group faces significant risk related to the successful and timely delivery of its strategic and product development programmes. Given the complexity of designing and manufacturing ultra-luxury vehicles, delays, cost overruns, or performance failures could result from a variety of factors, including but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, unforeseen technological challenges, regulatory changes, and resource constraints. Additionally, the pace of innovation in the automotive industry, including the transition to electric vehicles and evolving consumer preferences, presents both opportunities and risks to our programmes timelines. Any significant deviation from projected delivery schedules or cost estimates could impact the Group's financial performance, reputation, and market position. The Group employ vehicle line Project Management teams to deliver significant programmes using our 'Mission' Product Creation and Delivery System.\nCyber security and IT resilience:\nBreach of cyber security could result in a system outage, impacting core operations and / or result in a major data loss leading to reputational damage and financial loss.\nThe Group is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and the resilience of its IT systems, which are critical to both daily operations and long-term strategic objectives. Increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, data breaches, and system failures could result in significant disruption to business activities, financial loss, or damage to brand and reputation. As the automotive industry becomes more interconnected, with a growing reliance on digital platforms, connected vehicles, and advanced technologies, the risk of cyber threats escalates.\nThe Group is committed to maintaining a robust cybersecurity framework, improving threat detection and response capabilities, and ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory standards.\nSupply chain disruption:\nSupply chain disruption could result in production stoppages, delays, quality issues and increased costs.\nThe Group faces significant risks associated with the potential disruption to its global supply chain. Factors such as geopolitical instability, natural disasters, trade barriers, and fluctuations in demand can create vulnerabilities in the procurement of critical components and raw materials. These disruptions may result in delays, increased costs, and reduced flexibility, impacting production schedules and customer deliveries. The automotive sector, particularly in the luxury market, is heavily dependent on high-quality, specialised suppliers, and any disruption in the supply of these components could have a material impact on product quality and brand reputation.\nThe Group continues to invest in procedures and controls to monitor its supply chain and develop resilience.\nCompliance risks\nCompliance with laws and regulations:\nNon-compliance with laws or regulations could damage our corporate reputation and subject the Group to significant financial penalties and / or trading sanctions / restrictions. Non-compliance with product technical regulations and supply chain due diligence regulations could prevent the Group from competing in certain markets.\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of non-compliance with evolving laws, regulations, and standards across multiple jurisdictions in which it operates. This includes, but is not limited to, environmental, health and safety, product safety, data privacy, and anti-bribery regulations. As the automotive industry faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly with regard to sustainability and emissions standards, the risk of failing to comply with these requirements could result in significant fines, penalties, legal costs, and reputational damage. Additionally, non-compliance may also hinder the Group's ability to operate in certain markets or impact product approvals.\nThe Group continues to invest in compliance activities, including experienced personnel, and the development of its risk management systems.\nClimate Change risks\nClimate change\n: The impact of climate change could significantly affect demand for our vehicles, our ability to sell within certain markets or have financial consequences through increased carbon pricing, taxes and other regulatory restrictions on Internal Combustion Engine vehicles.\nThe luxury automotive industry is exposed to risks arising from climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Increasing regulatory pressures and global commitments to reduce carbon emissions may require substantial investment in sustainable technologies, such as electric vehicle development, alternative fuel systems, and carbon neutral manufacturing processes. Additionally, climate-related physical risks, such as extreme weather events or disruptions to supply chains due to environmental factors, could affect production capacity and operational efficiency.\nAs consumer expectations shift towards more sustainable products, failure to adapt to these changes may impact brand reputation and market share. The Group is committed to integrating climate-related considerations into its strategic and operational decisions, focussing on reducing carbon emissions, enhancing energy efficiency, and innovating within the alternative powertrain space.\nHowever, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding future climate-related policies and environmental risks represents an ongoing challenge to the business's long-term performance and competitiveness.\nFinancial risks\nLiquidity:\nThe Group may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund its capital expenditure, service its debt or sustain its operations.\nThe Group's significant leverage and existing levels of debt may make it difficult to obtain additional debt financing should the need arise due to unforeseen economic shocks.\u00a0Failure to collect planned deposits could place additional stress on the Group's liquidity. The Group's liquidity requirements arise primarily from its need to fund capital expenditure for product development, including the electrification of its product portfolio, and to service debt. The Group is also subject to foreign exchange risks and opportunities and manages its exposure in accordance with the Group Hedging Policy. During the last six months the Group raised additional liquidity through an Equity Placing which raised c.\u00a352.5m of liquidity and it has proposed to further enhance liquidity in H2 through the intended sale of its minority shareholding in the Aston Martin Aramco Formula One\u2122 Team.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n6 months ended\n30 June 2025\n6 months ended\n30 June 2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\nNotes\nAdjusted\nAdjusting items*\nTotal\nAdjusted\nAdjusting items*\nTotal\nAdjusted\nAdjusting items*\nTotal\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nRevenue\n3\n454.4\n-\n454.4\n603.0\n-\n603.0\n1,583.9\n-\n1,583.9\nCost of sales\n(327.8)\n-\n(327.8)\n(370.1)\n-\n(370.1)\n(1,000.0)\n-\n(1,000.0)\nGross profit\n126.6\n-\n126.6\n232.9\n-\n232.9\n583.9\n-\n583.9\nSelling and distribution expenses\n(54.1)\n-\n(54.1)\n(66.9)\n-\n(66.9)\n(135.4)\n-\n(135.4)\nAdministrative expenses\n4\n(194.0)\n(13.2)\n(207.2)\n(265.8)\n(6.3)\n(272.1)\n(531.3)\n(16.7)\n(548.0)\nOperating loss\n(121.5)\n(13.2)\n(134.7)\n(99.8)\n(6.3)\n(106.1)\n(82.8)\n(16.7)\n(99.5)\nFinance income\n4, 5\n75.4\n2.5\n77.9\n4.1\n13.4\n17.5\n7.1\n18.8\n25.9\nFinance expense\n4, 6\n(84.0)\n-\n(84.0)\n(92.4)\n(35.7)\n(128.1)\n(179.8)\n(35.7)\n(215.5)\nLoss before tax\n(130.1)\n(10.7)\n(140.8)\n(188.1)\n(28.6)\n(216.7)\n(255.5)\n(33.6)\n(289.1)\nIncome tax (charge)/credit\n4, 7\n(7.9)\n-\n(7.9)\n9.1\n-\n9.1\n(34.4)\n-\n(34.4)\nLoss for the period\n(138.0)\n(10.7)\n(148.7)\n(179.0)\n(28.6)\n(207.6)\n(289.9)\n(33.6)\n(323.5)\n(Loss)/profit for the period attributable to:\nOwners of the group\n(148.8)\n(207.8)\n(323.5)\nNon-controlling interests\n0.1\n0.2\n-\n(148.7)\n(207.6)\n(323.5)\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that will never be reclassified to the Income Statement\nRemeasurement of defined benefit pension liability (note 15)\n0.1\n0.3\n10.2\nChange in fair value of investments in equity instruments (note 12)\n25.0\n51.4\n51.4\nTaxation on items that will never be reclassified to the Income Statement\n(6.3)\n(12.9)\n(11.9)\nItems that are or may be reclassified to the Income Statement\nForeign exchange translation differences\n(1.6)\n(0.3)\n0.8\nFair value adjustment on cash flow hedges\n15.6\n3.8\n-\nAmounts recycled to the Income Statement in respect of cash flow hedges\n(1.0)\n0.2\n(3.6)\nTaxation on items that may be reclassified to the Income Statement\n(3.7)\n(1.0)\n0.9\nOther comprehensive income for the period, net of income tax\n28.1\n41.5\n47.8\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(120.6)\n(166.1)\n(275.7)\nTotal comprehensive (loss)/income for the period attributable to:\nOwners of the group\n(120.7)\n(166.3)\n(275.7)\nNon-controlling interests\n0.1\n0.2\n-\n(120.6)\n(166.1)\n(275.7)\nEarnings per ordinary share\nBasic loss per share\n8\n(15.6p)\n(25.3p)\n(38.9p)\nDiluted loss per share\n8\n(15.6p)\n(25.3p)\n(38.9p)\n* Adjusting items are detailed in note 4.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nShare Capital\nShare Premium\nMerger Reserve\nCapital Redemption\nReserve\nCapital Reserve\nTranslation Reserve\nHedge Reserve\nRetained Earnings\nNon-controlling Interest\nTotal Equity\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nAt 1 January 2025\n93.6\n2,192.6\n143.9\n9.3\n6.6\n3.3\n(1.9)\n(1,707.2)\n12.7\n752.9\nTotal comprehensive (loss)/profit for the period\n(Loss)/profit for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(148.8)\n0.1\n(148.7)\nOther comprehensive income\nForeign currency translation differences\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1.6)\n-\n-\n-\n(1.6)\nFair value movement -

The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The auditor's report on the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 was not qualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The annual report for the year ended 31 December 2025 will be prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards.\nAston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc (the \"Company\") is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The Consolidated Interim Condensed Financial Statements of the Company as at the end of the period ended 30 June 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group').\nGoing Concern\nThe Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements and medium-term funding requirements through a mixture of $1,050.0m Senior Secured Notes (\"SSNs\") at 10.0% and \u00a3565.0m of SSNs at 10.375% both of which mature in March 2029, a revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") (\u00a3170.0m) which matures on 31 December 2028, facilities to finance inventory, a bilateral RCF facility and a wholesale vehicle financing facility. Under the RCF, the Group is required to comply with a leverage covenant tested quarterly. Leverage is calculated as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt, after certain accounting adjustments are made. Of these adjustments, the most significant is to account for lease liabilities under \"frozen GAAP\", i.e. under IAS17 rather than IFRS 16. The Group has complied with its covenant requirements for the period ended 30 June 2025 and expects to do so for the going concern review period.\nThe directors have developed trading and cash flow forecasts for the period from the date of approval of these Interim Condensed Financial Statements through 30 September 2026 (the \"going concern review period\"). These forecasts show that the Group has sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due and to comply with covenants for the going concern review period.\nThe forecasts reflect the Group's ultra-luxury performance-oriented strategy, balancing supply and demand, and the actions taken to improve cost efficiency and gross margin. The forecasts include the costs of the Group's environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") commitments and make assumptions in respect of future market conditions and, in particular, wholesale volumes, average selling price, the launch of new models, and future operating costs. The nature of the Group's business is such that there can be variation in the timing of cash flows around the development and launch of new models. In addition, the availability of funds provided through the vehicle wholesale finance facility changes as the availability of credit insurance and sales volumes vary, in total and seasonally. The forecasts take into account these factors to the extent that the Directors consider them to represent their best estimate of the future based on the information that is available to them at the time of approval of these Interim Condensed Financial Statements.\nThe Group Directors have considered a severe but plausible downside scenario that includes considering the impact of a 20% reduction in DBX volumes and a 10% reduction in sports volumes from forecast levels covering, although not exclusively, operating costs higher than the base plan, margin headwinds arising from tariff legislation changes, incremental working capital requirements such as reduced deposit inflows or increased deposit outflows and the impact of the strengthening of the sterling-dollar exchange rate.\nThe Group plans to make continued investment for growth in the period and, accordingly, funds generated through operations are expected to be reinvested in the business mainly through new model development and other capital expenditure. To a certain extent such expenditure is discretionary and, in the event of risks occurring which could have a particularly severe effect on the Group, as identified in the severe but plausible downside scenario, actions such as constraining capital spending, working capital improvements, reduction in marketing expenditure and the continuation of strict and immediate expense control would be taken to safeguard the Group's financial position.\nIn addition, the Group Directors also considered the circumstances which would be needed to exhaust the Group's liquidity over the assessment period; a reverse stress test. This would indicate that vehicle sales would need to reduce by more than 30% from forecast levels without any of the above mitigations to result in having no liquidity. The likelihood of these circumstances occurring is considered remote both in terms of the magnitude of the reduction and that over such a long period, management could take substantial mitigating actions, such as reducing capital spending to preserve liquidity.\nAccordingly, after considering the forecasts, appropriate sensitivities, current trading and available facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and to comply with its financial covenants, therefore, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Interim Condensed Financial Statements.\nStatement of compliance\nThese Interim Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with\nUK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\"\n. They do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nMaterial accounting policies\nThese Interim Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Group's published Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. A number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period and the Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n2.\nPrior period restatement\nThe Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2024 has been restated to reflect a prior period adjustment in respect of the presentation of the RCF from current to non-current. The carrying amount of the RCF at 30 June 2024 was \u00a388.1m net of unamortised arrangement fees of \u00a31.9m. At 30 June 2024 \u00a390.0m of the \u00a3170.0m RCF was drawn as cash. The Group has a contractual right to rollover the RCF such that contractual repayment is not required until at least 12 months after the balance sheet date and therefore the Group has restated the RCF as a non-current liability in line with IAS 1. There is no change to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as there is no change to the timing of the cash movements.\nWhere the notes included in these Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional analysis in respect of amounts impacted by the above restatement, the comparative values presented have been restated on a consistent basis. The following table details the impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2024.\nAs previously reported 30 June 2024\nAdjustment\nRestated balance 30 June 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nCurrent liabilities\nBorrowings\n88.1\n(88.1)\n-\nNon-Current liabilities\nBorrowings\n1,140.5\n88.1\n1,228.6\nThere is no impact arising from the above restatement on the Consolidated Income Statement for the period ended 30 June 2024. As there is no adjustment to the Consolidated Income Statement and no change in the income tax position, there is no impact on earnings per share.\nAs the RCF was presented as a non-current borrowing in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2024, there is no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements as presented for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n3.\nSegmental information\nOperating segments are defined as components of the Group about which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in assessing performance. The Group has only one operating segment, the automotive segment, and therefore no separate segmental report is disclosed. The automotive segment includes all activities relating to design, development, manufacture and marketing of vehicles including consulting services; as well as the sale of parts, servicing and automotive brand activities from which the Group derives its revenues.\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\nRevenue\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nAnalysis by category\nSale of vehicles\n399.2\n548.8\n1,477.9\nSale of parts\n44.7\n42.8\n84.4\nServicing of vehicles\n5.7\n6.3\n11.0\nBrands and motorsport\n4.8\n5.1\n10.6\n454.4\n603.0\n1,583.9\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\nRevenue\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nAnalysis by geographic location\nUnited Kingdom\n100.5\n103.6\n262.1\nThe Americas\n149.2\n196.1\n629.2\nRest of Europe, Middle East & Africa\n127.7\n202.9\n434.7\nAsia Pacific\n77.0\n100.4\n257.9\n454.4\n603.0\n1,583.9\n4.\nAdjusting items\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nAdjusting operating expenses:\nERP implementation costs1\n(3.6)\n(4.5)\n(10.0)\nLegal costs2\n(2.3)\n(4.2)\n(8.1)\nLegal settlement income2\n-\n2.4\n2.9\nDirector settlement and change costs3\n-\n-\n(1.5)\nRestructuring costs4\n(7.3)\n-\n-\n(13.2)\n(6.3)\n(16.7)\nAdjusting finance income:\nGain on financial instruments recognised at fair value through Consolidated Income Statement\n5\n2.5\n12.7\n18.1\nGain on financial instrument utilised during refinance transactions\n6\n-\n0.7\n0.7\nAdjusting finance expenses:\nPremium paid on the early redemption of SSNs6\n-\n(35.7)\n(35.7)\n2.5\n(22.3)\n(16.9)\nAdjusting items before tax\n(10.7)\n(28.6)\n(33.6)\nTax charge on adjusting items7\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusting items after tax\n(10.7)\n(28.6)\n(33.6)\nSummary of adjusting items\n1. In the 6 months ended 30 June 2025 the Group incurred further implementation costs for a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for which the Group will not own any Intellectual Property. During the period \u00a33.6m (6 months ended 30 June 2024: \u00a34.5m, 12 months ended 31 December 2024: \u00a310.0m) of costs have been incurred and expensed to the Income Statement. During the period, the Group completed the migration of the second manufacturing site with the business currently in post go-live optimisation phase. Due to the infrequent recurrence of such costs and the expected quantum during the implementation phase, these have been separately presented as adjusting. The cash impact of this item is a working capital outflow at the time of invoice payment.\n2. During the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Group incurred legal costs in relation to a number of disputes and claims with entities ultimately owned by a former significant shareholder of the Group. The Group has incurred legal costs of \u00a32.3m (30 June 2024: \u00a34.2m; 31 December 2024: \u00a38.1m) associated with its defence of such claims and pursuit of its counterclaims. AMMENA, Aston Martin's distributor in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey region has brought various claims, which the Group denies. Certain aspects of these claims, and Aston Martin's counterclaims, were heard in a confidential arbitration in September 2024. The Tribunal made a partial award in November 2024. In May 2025, the counterparty was granted permission to appeal a specific part of the award and that appeal is expected to be heard by the High Court in September 2025.\nSeparately, on 1 March 2024 a court order was issued quantifying the amounts payable to the Group from the judgment of a previous case involving claims against a retail dealership, which is ultimately owned by entities that are shareholders in one of the Group's subsidiary entities, including for unpaid debts relating to two agreements from 2015 and 2016. The Group was awarded certain of its legal costs, including some on an indemnity basis. Following challenge by the counterparty, the overall amount received by the Group was \u00a32.9m. All remaining amounts due in relation to this dispute have now been resolved.\nWhilst disputes and legal proceedings pending are often in the normal course of the Group's business, in all these cases the opposing party has links to companies that were former significant shareholders of the Group. On that basis the Group has classified these costs as non-recurring in nature.\nThe Group has disclosed a contingent liability in respect of ongoing claims with former significant shareholders of the Group at the period ended 30 June 2025 (note 18).\n3. On 22 March 2024 it was announced that Amedeo Felisa would be retiring from the business and Adrian Hallmark would be joining the Group as Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Marco Mattiacci, the Group's Chief Commercial Officer, left the Group on 31 December 2024. The total costs associated with these changes was \u00a31.5m, all of which represents severance costs and payments in lieu of notice. Due to the nature and quantum, these items have been separately presented. The cash impact of such changes was a working capital movement in the six months ended 30 June 2025.\n4. On 26 February 2025 it was announced that the Group was commencing a process to make organisational adjustments which is expected to ultimately see the departure of around 170 valued colleagues from the Group, representing circa 5% of the global workforce. During the six months ended 30 June 2025 the Group recognised a provision of \u00a37.3m in relation to restructuring costs. As at 30 June 2025 \u00a32.3m of the costs have been realised with the remaining \u00a35.0m expected to be settled in the second half of the year.\n5. During 2020 the Group issued second lien Senior Secured Notes which included detachable warrants classified as a derivative option liability. The movement in fair value of the warrants between 31 December 2024 and 30 June 2025 resulted in a gain of \u00a32.5m being recognised in the Income Statement (6 months ended 30 June 2024: gain of \u00a312.7m; 12 months ended 31 December 2024: gain of \u00a318.1m). This item has no cash impact.\n6. During the 6 months ended 30 June 2024 the Group undertook a refinancing exercise whereby new SSNs of $960.0m at 10.0% and \u00a3400.0m at 10.375% repayable 31 March 2029 were issued, and all outstanding First Lien and Second Lien SSNs issued by the Group were repaid. To facilitate the repayment of the outstanding SSNs, the Group placed a forward currency contract to purchase US dollars. Due to favourable movements in the exchange rates, a gain of \u00a30.7m was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement at the transaction date. There is no cash impact of this adjustment. Additionally, in repaying the notes prior to their redemption date, a redemption premium of \u00a335.7m was incurred, of which the cash impact was incurred in the period ended 30 June 2024.\n7. In the period to 30 June 2025, a Nil tax charge has been recognised on Adjusting items (6 months ended 30 June 2024: Nil tax charge; 12 months ended 31 December 2024: Nil tax charge). This is on the basis that the adjusting items generate net deferred tax assets, specifically tax losses, which have not been recognised to the extent that sufficient taxable profits are not forecast in the foreseeable future to which the tax losses would be utilised.\n5.\nFinance income\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nBank deposit and other interest income\n3.3\n4.1\n7.1\nForeign exchange gain on borrowings not designated as part of a hedging relationship\n72.1\n-\n-\nFinance income before adjusting items\n75.4\n4.1\n7.1\nAdjusting finance income items:\nGain on financial instruments recognised at fair value through Income Statement\n(note 4)\n2.5\n12.7\n18.1\nGain on financial instrument utilised during refinance transactions (note 4)\n-\n0.7\n0.7\n77.9\n17.5\n25.9\n6.\nFinance expense\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nInterest on bank loans, overdrafts and SSNs\n78.7\n79.1\n151.4\nInterest on lease liabilities\n2.0\n2.1\n4.2\nNet interest expense on the net defined benefit liability (note 15)\n0.7\n1.0\n2.0\nInterest on contract liabilities held\n0.4\n2.2\n3.7\nForeign exchange loss on borrowings not designated as part of a hedging relationship\n-\n6.3\n14.1\nEffect of discounting on long term liabilities\n2.2\n1.7\n4.4\nFinance expense before adjusting items\n84.0\n92.4\n179.8\nAdjusting finance expense items:\nPremium paid on the early redemption of SSNs (note 4)\n-\n35.7\n35.7\nTotal adjusting finance expense\n-\n35.7\n35.7\nTotal finance expense\n84.0\n128.1\n215.5\n7.\nIncome tax credit\nThe Group's total income tax charge for the period to 30 June 2025 is \u00a37.9m (period ended 30 June 2024: \u00a39.1m tax credit) which represents an effective tax rate of (5.6)%\u00a0(period ended 30 June 2024: 4.2%). The difference between the total effective tax rate of (5.6)% and the UK statutory tax rate of 25% is predominantly due to net prior year deferred tax assets no longer recognised.\u00a0Net deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses or credits can be recovered or utilised. In evaluating the level of probable future taxable profits the Group reviews the same underlying assumptions and future forecasts used for going concern and business planning. Tax on other comprehensive income of \u00a39.9m is predominantly related to the fair value movement of investments recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income.\nThe future forecasts cover an extended period, which inherently increases the level of significant estimation uncertainty in the later periods. Specifically in this context, for the deferred tax assets held by the main UK trading entity, a defined look-out period for Internal Combustion Engine ('ICE') and Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle ('PHEV') to 31 December 2030 was selected on the basis that this timeframe correlates to existing vehicle life cycles and the prior year look-out period end date. All other methodologies used in determining deferred tax balances are consistent with those used at 31 December 2024.\nAn increase/decrease of \u00a350m in forecast taxable UK profits by 2030 would increase/decrease the level of deferred tax asset that would be recognised on losses by \u00a36.3m under current UK tax legislation. A 20% decrease in DBX volumes, a 10% decrease in sports volumes and an \u00a382m non-achievement of cost-saving initiatives, adverse movements in foreign exchange and headwinds from tariffs to the base forecasts results in a potential decrease in recognition of \u00a362m, equivalent to 5 years of additional recognition under current UK tax legislation.\nPillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The legislation is effective from the Group's financial year commencing 1 January 2024. The Group has performed an assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two Transitional Safe Harbour provisions are expected to apply in each jurisdiction the Group operates in, and management is not aware of any circumstance under which this might change. Therefore, there is no tax expense associated with the Pillar Two legislation for the financial period ended 30 June 2025. The Group has applied the exception in IAS 12 'Income Taxes' to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n8.\nEarnings per ordinary share\nIn calculating the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025, a total of 2,301,201 ordinary shares issued to the Employee Benefit Trust are excluded owing to the control the Group has over the Trust (6 months ended 30 June 2024: 2,301,201 ordinary shares excluded; 12 months ended 31 December 2024: 2,301,201 ordinary shares excluded).\nContinuing and total operations\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\nBasic earnings per ordinary share\nLoss available for equity holders (\u00a3m)\n(148.8)\n(207.8)\n(323.5)\nBasic weighted average number of ordinary shares (million)\n955.5\n822.6\n832.4\nBasic earnings per ordinary share (pence)\n(15.6)p\n(25.3)p\n(38.9p)\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share\nLoss available for equity holders (\u00a3m)\n(148.8)\n(207.8)\n(323.5)\nDiluted weighted average number of ordinary shares (million)\n955.5\n822.6\n832.4\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share (pence)\n(15.6)p\n(25.3)p\n(38.9p)\nThe impact of ordinary shares issued as part of the Long-term incentive plans (\"LTIP\") and the potential number of ordinary shares issued as part of the 2020 issue of share warrants have been excluded from the weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares as including them is anti-dilutive in arriving at diluted earnings per share.\n9.\nResearch and Development expenditure\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nTotal research and development expenditure\n123.2\n158.4\n333.3\nCapitalised research and development expenditure\n(117.9)\n(146.5)\n(312.1)\nResearch and development expenditure recognised as an expense during the period\n5.3\n11.9\n21.2\n10.\nNet debt\n30 June\n2025\n*30 June\n2024 (restated)\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nCash and cash equivalents\n123.6\n172.7\n359.6\nInventory repurchase arrangements1\n(38.0)\n(38.9)\n(38.4)\nLoans and other borrowings - non-current2\n(1,369.3)\n(1,228.6)\n(1,387.3)\nLease liabilities - current\n(9.8)\n(8.2)\n(9.4)\nLease liabilities - non-current\n(84.2)\n(90.8)\n(87.2)\n(1,377.7)\n(1,193.8)\n(1,162.7)\n* Detail on the restatement is disclosed in note 2.\n1. At 30 June 2025 a repurchase liability of \u00a338.0m including accrued interest of \u00a30.1m (30 June 2024: \u00a338.9m including accrued interest of \u00a31.3m; 31 December 2024: \u00a338.4m including accrued interest of \u00a30.7m) was included within accruals and other payables and Net Debt relating to parts for resale, service parts and production stock which were sold in 2025 and subsequently repurchased. Under the repurchase agreement, which has a repayment date of February 2026, the Group will repay \u00a340.0m gross of indirect tax. As part of this arrangement legal title to the parts was surrendered, however control remained with the Group. The arrangement which existed as at 30 June 2024 was fully settled during the six months ended 30 June 2025.\n2. Included within loans and other borrowings is the balance drawn on the Group's \u00a3170.0m RCF. At 30 June 2025 \u00a360.0m of the \u00a3170.0m RCF was drawn down in cash (30 June 2024: \u00a390.0m of \u00a3170.0m facility, 31 December 2024: \u00a310.0m of \u00a3170.0m facility). \u00a35.9m of the RCF has been reserved for the issuance of letters of credit and guarantees (30 June 2024: \u00a35.9m of the revolving credit facility was reserved; 31 December 2024: \u00a35.9m was reserved). The loan is presented net of amortised transaction fees of \u00a31.3m (30 June 2024: \u00a31.9m; 31 December 2024: \u00a31.6m).\n11.\nMovement in net debt\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nMovement in net debt\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n(236.0)\n(219.7)\n(32.8)\nAdd back cash flows in respect of other components of net debt:\nNew borrowings\n(50.0)\n(1,243.1)\n(1,394.6)\nProceeds from inventory repurchase arrangement\n(37.8)\n(37.7)\n(75.4)\nRepayment of existing borrowings\n-\n1,084.9\n1,084.9\nRepayment of inventory repurchase arrangement\n40.0\n40.0\n80.0\nLease liability payments\n4.7\n4.8\n9.5\nTransaction fees paid on financing activities\n1.6\n20.6\n24.3\nIncrease in net debt arising from cash flows\n(277.5)\n(350.2)\n(304.1)\nNon-cash movements:\nForeign exchange gain/(loss) on SSNs\n72.1\n(6.3)\n(14.1)\nInterest added to debt\n(1.6)\n(1.5)\n(4.6)\nMovement in transaction fee accruals\n(1.6)\n1.2\n1.7\nBorrowing fee amortisation\n(4.1)\n(16.1)\n(18.5)\nLease liability interest charge\n(2.0)\n(2.1)\n(4.2)\nLease modifications\n(0.8)\n(1.5)\n(1.6)\nNew leases\n(1.8)\n(5.3)\n(7.7)\nExchange and other adjustments\n2.3\n2.3\n4.7\nIncrease in net debt\n(215.0)\n(379.5)\n(348.4)\nNet debt at beginning of the period/year\n(1,162.7)\n(814.3)\n(814.3)\nNet debt at the end of the period/year\n(1,377.7)\n(1,193.8)\n(1,162.7)\n12.\nInvestments in equity interests - Assets held for sale\nOn 15 November 2023, the Group subscribed for shares in AMR GP Holdings Limited by exercising its primary warrant option and subscribing for reward shares it was entitled to under the initial sponsorship term. The primary warrant became exercisable following the Group entering an agreement with AMR GP for a second sponsorship term running from 2026 to 2030.\nAs at 30 June 2024 the Group had measured the fair value of its holding in line with the equity value implied by investments into AMR GP by a number of third parties.\nThe Group made the election to carry the investment at fair value through other comprehensive income and will continue to fair value the investment in line with the requirements of IFRS 9 at future balance sheet dates. This election was made to reduce volatility due to movements in fair value within the Consolidated Income Statement.\nOn 31 March 2025 the Group announced its intention to dispose of its entire shareholding in AMR GP Holdings Limited. The shareholding is available for sale in its current condition and there is an active sale process underway. As the Group is committed to selling the shareholding, the asset has been classed as held for sale as at 30 June 2025.\nAs there is an active sale process underway, the Group has uplifted the fair value of its shareholding by \u00a325.0m in line with the valuation in the proposed sale agreement.\nInvestments - asset held for sale*\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nOpening\n50.9\n18.2\n18.2\nFair value change\n25.0\n51.4\n51.4\nDisposals\n-\n-\n(18.7)\nClosing\n75.9\n69.6\n50.9\n* At 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024 the investment is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as \"Investments in equity interests\" within non-current assets due to the lack of an active plan to dispose of the shareholding on those dates.\n13.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe following tables provide an analysis of financial instruments grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the value is observable.\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\nNominal Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nNominal Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nNominal Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nIncluded in assets\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nLevel 2\nForward foreign exchange contracts\n-\n11.6\n11.6\n-\n6.6\n6.6\n-\n1.0\n1.0\nInvestments held for sale\n-\n75.9\n75.9\n-\n69.6\n69.6\n-\n50.9\n50.9\nOther derivative contracts\n-\n34.6\n34.6\n-\n-\n-\n-\n23.2\n23.2\n-\n122.1\n122.1\n-\n76.2\n76.2\n-\n75.1\n75.1\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\nNominal Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nNominal Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nNominal Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nIncluded in liabilities\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nLevel 1\n$1,050.0 10% US dollar Notes (30 June 2024: $960.0m 10% US dollar Notes)\n765.7\n756.0\n716.0\n759.4\n747.0\n746.5\n837.7\n826.2\n820.0\n\u00a3465.0m 10.375% GBP Notes (30 June 2024: \u00a3400.0m 10.375% GBP Notes)\n464.6\n459.2\n434.5\n400.0\n393.5\n398.5\n464.6\n458.0\n458.4\n\u00a3100.0m 10.375% GBP Notes\n97.1\n95.4\n92.5\n-\n-\n-\n96.6\n94.7\n97.6\nLevel 2\nForward foreign exchange contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1.7\n1.7\n-\n5.6\n5.6\nDerivative option over own shares\n33.1\n2.5\n2.5\n33.1\n10.4\n10.4\n33.1\n5.0\n5.0\nOther derivative contracts\n-\n23.2\n23.2\n-\n-\n-\n-\n23.2\n23.2\n1,360.5\n1,336.3\n1,268.7\n1,192.5\n1,152.6\n1,157.1\n1,432.0\n1,412.7\n1,409.8\nUnder IFRS 7, such assets and liabilities are classified by the way in which their fair value is calculated. The interest bearing loans and borrowings are considered to be level 1 liabilities. Forward foreign exchange contracts are considered to be level 2 assets and liabilities. Derivative options are considered to be level 2 liabilities.\nIFRS 13 defines each level as follows:\n\u00b7\nlevel 1 assets and liabilities have inputs observable through quoted prices;\n\u00b7\nlevel 2 assets and liabilities have inputs observable, other than quoted prices, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); or\n\u00b7\nlevel 3 assets and liabilities as those with inputs not based on observable market data.\nThe forward currency contracts are carried at fair value based on pricing models and discounted cash flow techniques derived from assumptions provided by third party banks.\nOther derivative contracts represent the secondary warrant option which entitles the Group to subscribe for additional equity in AMR GP for a fixed value. The secondary warrant option, an embedded derivative, was not recognised upon entering the initial sponsorship contract in March 2020 due to insufficient certainty over the conditions attached to the warrant being achieved. During 2024, the Group further extended its sponsorship contract with AMR GP for a period from 2031 to 2045 giving the Group sufficient certainty to recognise the derivative as a financial asset. A corresponding liability was recognised on recognition of the derivative which represents an accrual for that element of future sponsorship payments. The fair value of the option was assessed in the same manner as the Group values its existing investment in AMR GP (see note 12) resulting in an increase in the fair value of the derivative asset of \u00a311.4m during the six months ended 30 June 2025. The option is exercisable from 1 January 2031. The Group is currently in negotiations to amend its rights in relation to the exercise period of the option as part of the wider sale of interests in AMR GP (see note 12). As the amendments have not concluded as at 30 June 2025 the derivative option has not been classified as held for sale due to not being available for immediate sale in its present condition.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are all valued at amortised cost retranslated at the year-end foreign exchange rate where applicable. The fair value of these Notes at the current and comparative period ends are determined by reference to the quoted price on The International Stock Exchange Authority in St. Peter Port, Guernsey. The fair value and nominal value exclude the impact of transaction costs.\nThe derivative option over own shares reflects the detachable warrants issued alongside the 2020 second lien SSNs enabling the warrant holders to subscribe for a number of Ordinary Shares in the Company. The fair value is calculated using a binomial model and updated at each period end reflecting the latest market conditions. The inputs used in the valuation model include the quoted share price, market volatility, exercise ratio, and risk-free rate. The fair value movement in the option for the period ended 30 June 2025 was a gain of \u00a32.5m (30 June 2024: gain of \u00a312.7m; 31 December 2024: gain of \u00a318.1m) and is recognised within the Consolidated Income Statement in interest income as an adjusting item.\n14.\nProvisions\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n31 December\n2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nWarranty provision\n45.2\n43.2\n46.8\nRestructuring provision\n5.0\n-\n-\n50.2\n43.2\n46.8\nCurrent\n19.7\n21.1\n19.7\nNon-current\n30.5\n22.1\n27.1\n50.2\n43.2\n46.8\nOn 26 February 2025 it was announced that the Group was commencing a process to make organisational adjustments which is expected to ultimately see the departure of around 170 valued colleagues from the Group, representing circa 5% of the global workforce. During the six months ended 30 June 2025 the Group recognised a provision of \u00a37.3m in relation to restructuring costs. As at 30 June 2025 \u00a32.3m of the costs have been realised with the remaining \u00a35.0m expected to be settled in the second half of the year.\n15.\nPension Obligations\nThe net liability for defined benefit obligations of \u00a328.7m at 31 December 2024 has decreased to a net liability of \u00a325.4m at 30 June 2025. The movement of \u00a33.3m comprises an underlying charge to the Income Statement of \u00a30.8m offset by an actuarial gain of \u00a30.1m in addition to contributions of \u00a34.0m.\nFollowing the High Court ruling in the case of Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited and others in June 2023, it was held that section 37 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 operates to make void any amendment to the rules of a contracted out pension scheme without written actuarial confirmation under Regulation 42(2) of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Contracting Out) Regulations 1996, in so far that the amendment relates to members' section 9(2B) rights. The Department for Work and Pensions' made an announcement on 5 June 2025 outlining the Government's proposed legislation to allow retrospective actuarial confirmation of benefit changes to deal with issues arising from the Virgin Media v NTL Pension Trustees judgment. The Trustees of the Scheme and the Plan (collectively the \"Pension Schemes\") have confirmed that; - The Pension Schemes were contracted out of the additional state pension between 1997 and 2016; and - It was possible that amendments were made to the Pension Schemes that may have impacted on the members' section 9(2B) rights. The Trustees of the Pension Schemes and the Directors work closely together and take appropriate legal and professional advice when making amendments to the Pension Schemes.\nAn initial assessment has been undertaken to determine whether any amendments to section 9(2B) rights were made to the Pension Schemes that were not in accordance with section 37 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 requirements, however as at 30 June 2025, the assessment is ongoing and no final conclusions have been reached.\u00a0Further, it is not currently possible to reliably estimate any potential impact to the defined benefit obligations of the Pension Schemes if these amendments were not in accordance with section 37 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 requirements.

The shares were issued at 100p, raising gross proceeds of \u00a3111.2m, with \u00a311.1m recognised as share capital and the remaining \u00a3100.1m recognised as share premium.

The Group denies the claims made and is working to resolve the matter.\n19.\nAlternative performance measures\nIn the reporting of financial information, the directors have adopted various Alternative Performance Measures (\"APMs\"). APMs should be considered in addition to IFRS measurements. The directors believe that these APMs assist in providing useful information on the underlying performance of the Group, enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods, and are used internally by the directors to measure the Group's performance.\nThe key APMs that the Group focuses on are as follows:\ni) Adjusted EBT is the loss before tax and adjusting items as shown in the Consolidated Income Statement.\nii) Adjusted EBIT is operating (loss)/profit before adjusting items.\niii) Adjusted EBITDA removes depreciation, loss on sale of fixed assets and amortisation from adjusted EBIT.\niv) Adjusted operating margin is adjusted EBIT divided by revenue.\nv) Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) divided by revenue.\nvi) Adjusted Earnings Per Share is loss after tax before adjusting items as shown in the Consolidated Income Statement, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the reporting period.\nvii) Net Debt is current and non-current borrowings in addition to inventory repurchase arrangements and lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and cash held not available for short-term use as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nviii) Adjusted leverage is represented by the ratio of Net Debt to the last twelve months ('LTM') Adjusted EBITDA.\nix) Free cashflow is represented by cash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities plus the cash used in investing activities (excluding interest received) plus interest paid in the year less interest received.\nIncome Statement\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nLoss before tax\n(140.8)\n(216.7)\n(289.1)\nAdjusting operating expenses\n13.2\n6.3\n16.7\nAdjusting finance income\n(2.5)\n(13.4)\n(18.8)\nAdjusting finance expense\n-\n35.7\n35.7\nAdjusted loss before tax (EBT)\n(130.1)\n(188.1)\n(255.5)\nAdjusted finance income\n(75.4)\n(4.1)\n(7.1)\nAdjusted finance expense\n84.0\n92.4\n179.8\nAdjusted operating loss (EBIT)\n(121.5)\n(99.8)\n(82.8)\nAdjusted operating margin\n(26.7%)\n(16.6%)\n(5.2%)\nReported depreciation\n35.2\n45.4\n84.4\nReported amortisation\n83.3\n116.6\n269.3\nLoss on sale/scrap of property, plant and equipment\n-\n-\n0.1\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(3.0)\n62.2\n271.0\nEarnings per share\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2024\n12 months ended\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nAdjusted earnings per ordinary share\nLoss available for equity holders (\u00a3m)\n(148.8)\n(207.8)\n(323.5)\nAdjusting items\nAdjusting items before tax (\u00a3m)\n10.7\n28.6\n33.6\nTax on adjusting items (\u00a3m)\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted loss (\u00a3m)\n(138.1)\n(179.2)\n(289.9)\nBasic weighted average number of ordinary shares (million)\n955.5\n822.6\n832.4\nAdjusted loss per ordinary share (pence)\n(14.5p)\n(21.8p)\n(34.8p)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share\nAdjusted loss (\u00a3m)\n(138.1)\n(179.2)\n(289.9)\nDiluted weighted average number of ordinary shares (million)\n955.5\n822.6\n832.4\nAdjusted diluted loss per ordinary share (pence)\n(14.5p)\n(21.8p)\n(34.8p)\nNet debt\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nOpening cash and cash equivalents\n359.6\n392.4\n392.4\nCash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities\n(81.0)\n(71.9)\n123.9\nCash outflow from investing activities\n(167.4)\n(196.1)\n(374.8)\nCash inflow from financing activities\n18.4\n49.2\n215.8\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(6.0)\n(0.9)\n2.3\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n123.6\n172.7\n359.6\nInventory repurchase arrangement\n(38.0)\n(38.9)\n(38.4)\nLease liabilities\n(94.0)\n(99.0)\n(96.6)\nBorrowings\n(1,369.3)\n(1,228.6)\n(1,387.3)\nNet Debt\n(1,377.7)\n(1,193.8)\n(1,162.7)\nAdjusted LTM EBITDA\n205.8\n287.5\n271.0\nAdjusted leverage (LTM)\n6.7x\n4.2x\n4.3x\nFree Cashflow\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nNet cash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities\n(81.0)\n(71.9)\n123.9\nNet cash used in investing activities less interest received\n(170.6)\n(200.1)\n(400.6)\nInterest paid less interest received\n(69.4)\n(40.6)\n(114.9)\nFree cashflow\n(321.0)\n(312.6)\n(391.6)\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT\nThe Interim consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance\nUK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge that the Interim Management Report includes a fair review of the information required by:\n(a) DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n(b) DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being related party transactions that have taken place in the first six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and any changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report that could do so.\nBy order of the Board\nAdrian Hallmark Doug Lafferty\nChief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer\n29 July 2025 29 July 2025\nIndependent review report to Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc\nConclusion\nWe have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2025 which comprises the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and notes 1 to 19. We have read the other information contained in the half yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any\napparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is not prepared\n, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.\nBasis for Conclusion\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (UK) \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" (ISRE) issued\nby the Financial Reporting Council. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nAs disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the group are prepared in accordance\nwith UK adopted international accounting standards. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\nConclusions Relating to Going Concern\nBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for Conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that management have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that management have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not\nappropriately disclosed.\nThis conclusion is based on the review procedures performed\nin accordance with this ISRE, however future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\nResponsibilities of the directors\nThe directors are responsible for\npreparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.\nIn preparing the half-yearly financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the review of the financial information\nIn reviewing the half-yearly report, we are responsible for expressing to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report. Our conclusion,\nincluding our Conclusions Relating to Going Concern, are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for Conclusion paragraph of this report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the\ncompany in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (UK) \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Financial Reporting Council. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.\nErnst & Young LLP\nLondon\n29 July 2025\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In response to these market dynamics, we have taken, and continue to take, proactive steps to strengthen our overall position. Work is underway to review our future product cycle plan with the aim of optimising costs and capital investment whilst continuing to deliver innovative, class leading products to meet customer demands and regulatory requirements.\n\"Our core range of models, supported by recent new derivatives, has never been stronger. Valhalla, our first mid-engined plug-in hybrid, enhances this further and in October we reached a pivotal moment in delivering the first of these landmark supercars. We expect to ramp up Valhalla deliveries during the fourth quarter, which will be instrumental in driving improved sequential Q4 2025 financial performance. More importantly, the planned delivery of around 500 Valhallas in 2026, is expected to bolster our profitability and cash flow for the year ahead, in addition to ongoing cost efficiencies.\"\nLawrence Stroll, Aston Martin Executive Chairman commented:\n\"2025 has brought several unexpected challenges at Aston Martin which the Company, under Adrian's leadership, is actively adapting to. My confidence in the long-term prospects for this iconic British brand and commitment to the Company remains unwavering. The positive reception to all our new core models and the groundbreaking Valhalla, which I've experienced first-hand, will help propel Aston Martin forward in 2026 and beyond.\"\nAston Martin's CEO and CFO will host a\nQ&A\nat 8:30am (GMT) today.

This was as a result of the heightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment impacting demand including the ongoing effect of tariffs, in addition to the planned delivery of fewer Specials. Retail volumes in Q3 2025 were in line with total wholesales.\nAston Martin expects to realise the benefits from its expanded range of new core models and Specials in Q4 2025, and beyond. Core models now include Vanquish Volante with deliveries commencing in Q3 2025 and DBX S, Vantage S and Volante 60th anniversary limited edition models deliveries commencing in Q4 2025 whilst DB12 S deliveries will commence in the first half of 2026. The significant milestone of delivering the first of the 999 Valhallas was achieved in October following homologation approvals being received in Europe. The Group expects to deliver c. 150 Valhallas in Q4 2025, assuming no impact from the current U.S. federal government shutdown or the U.S. tariff quota system.\nDuring this period of continued product evolution, the orderbook for core vehicles",

The person responsible for releasing this announcement on behalf of the Company is Liz Miles, Company Secretary.\nAston Martin today provides the following Q3 2025 Trading Update and a revision to FY 2025 guidance ahead of its Q3 2025 Results on 29th October 2025.\nAs a result of the heightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment, including the ongoing impact of tariffs, the Company now expects total wholesale volumes in FY 2025 to decline by mid-high single digit percentage when compared to the prior year (FY 2024; 6,030). This revision reflects the Group's continued focus on maintaining a disciplined approach to balancing core wholesales and retail demand in the current trading environment.\nAdditionally, the company confirms that it expects Valhalla deliveries to commence in Q4 2025, with c.150 deliveries forecast in the period. Whilst this is behind prior expectations, it reflects a timing impact, with a smooth delivery profile expected in 2026.\nManagement has initiated an immediate review of future cost and capital expenditure but not withstanding this now expects FY 2025 adjusted EBIT to be below the lower end of the range of market consensus (consensus adjusted EBIT low end: \u00a3(110)m) and no longer expects positive free cash flow generation in H2 2025.\nQ3 2025 Trading Update\nThe Group delivered c. 1,430 wholesale units in Q3 2025, below the previous guidance of being broadly similar to the prior year period (Q3 2024: 1,641). The shortfall was due to weaker than expected demand including in both North America, with the continuing tariff impact, and APAC (including greater China). Q3 2025 retail volumes were in line with wholesales. Q3 2025 financial performance will reflect the impact from fewer than expected wholesale volumes combined with the expected negative mix impact of fewer Special deliveries.\nAston Martin has continued with its launch of new core derivatives, with customer deliveries for the new Vanquish Volante commencing during Q3 2025. In Q4 2025 the Group expects to commence deliveries of the new Vantage S and DBX S, which has received exceptional initial media reviews.\nValhalla entered production in Q3 2025, with a gradual ramp up in volumes planned through to the end of the year. Initial customer deliveries are still expected to commence during Q4 2025, albeit on a marginally delayed timeline linked to completion of vehicle engineering and the finalisation of mandatory homologation approvals. Due to this timing issue, the Group expects to reduce the number of Valhalla wholesales in Q4 2025 to c. 150. Additional risks to the delivery schedule for FY 2025 remain, associated with the current U.S. federal government shutdown potentially impacting final U.S. homologation timing and the ongoing uncertainty created by the U.S. tariff quota system.\nAston Martin completed the sale of shares in AMR GP in Q3 2025, receiving gross proceeds of c. \u00a3108m. This supports the Group's total liquidity, which ended the period at c. \u00a3250m.\nUpdated outlook\nThe global macroeconomic environment facing the industry remains challenging. This includes uncertainties over the economic impact from U.S. tariffs and the implementation of the quota mechanism, changes to China's ultra-luxury car taxes and the increased potential for supply chain pressures, particularly following the recent cyber incident at a major UK automotive manufacturer.\nQ4 2025 is expected to deliver improved sequential financial performance supported by increased core volumes driven by new derivatives in addition to the accretive financial contribution from the initial deliveries of Valhalla. However, the Group no longer expects to meet its previous FY 2025 wholesale volume guidance given Q3 2025 performance and a revised expectation for Q4 2025 wholesales. The latter revision reflects the Group's continued focus on maintaining a disciplined approach to balancing core wholesales and retail demand in the current challenging macroeconomic environment. The Group now expects total wholesale volumes in FY 2025 to decline by mid-to-high single digit percentage compared to the prior year (FY 2024: 6,030) with the majority of the volume adjustment related to the North America and APAC (including Greater China) regions.\nThe Group expects FY 2025 adjusted EBIT to now be below the lower end of the range of market consensus (consensus adjusted EBIT low end: \u00a3(110)m) driven by the weaker volumes and pressure on the gross margin per vehicle. FY 2025 capex is now expected to reduce to c. \u00a3375m (previo",

Our financial performance reflected fewer planned Specials deliveries as we advance towards commencing initial customer deliveries of Valhalla, our first-ever mid-engine PHEV supercar, in Q4 2025. Retail volumes materially outpaced wholesales by over 40%, reflecting our disciplined approach to production and deliveries. We were encouraged by a strong core average selling price in H1 2025, increasing 7% compared to the prior year period. This demonstrates the positive impact of our recently launched range of models, including our V12 Vanquish, and ongoing strong demand for personalisation from our customers\ndriving an 18% contribution to core revenue\n.\n\"The evolving and disruptive U.S. tariff situation was unhelpful to our operations in Q2. In response, we adjusted production and limited imports through April and May while awaiting confirmation of a trade agreement between the UK and the U.S., leveraging existing inventory held by our U.S. dealers in that period. We resumed shipments to the U.S. in June in anticipation of a finalised agreement which came into effect on 30 June 2025. We continue to actively engage the UK government to urge them to improve the quota mechanism to ensure fair access for the whole UK car industry to the 10% rate on an ongoing basis.\n\"Whilst we continue to navigate a complex operating environment, we are excited about the potential of our recently launched Vantage S which joins the DBX S, Vantage Roadster and Vanquish Volante. This gives customers even greater choice across our core range, in addition to our Specials, Valhalla and Valkyrie LM. The volume growth these new models will deliver in H2, combined with the benefits from our transformation programme, unlocking new revenue opportunities and enhancing operational performance, are expected to drive significantly improved financial performance in H2 compared with H1.\"\nAston Martin's management team will host a\nwebcast presentation\nand live Q&A\nat 8am (BST) today.

It continues to invest in future growth opportunities and the proceeds of the Financing are also expected to be used by the Group to support capital investments related to the Company's electrification strategy, consistent with its plans to invest c.\u00a0\u00a32 billion\u00a0over the five year period between 2023 and 2027, and to repay the borrowings under its existing super senior revolving credit facility, to pay fees and expenses and for general corporate p\nurposes.\nThrough the Share Offering 111,249,416 new Ordinary Shares have been subscribed for, raising gross proceeds of approximately \u00a3111 million at a price of 100.00 pence per Ordinary Share (the \"Placing Price\"), which represents a discount of 7.3% to the closing share price of 107.90 pence on 26 November 2024.

The Company is pleased by the strong support it has received from new investors and existing shareholders. Allocations were determined by an independent sub-committee of the Board.\nPursuant to the Director Subscription, one of the directors of the Company has agreed to subscribe for 1,000,000 Director Subscription Shares, representing a consideration of \u00a31 million.\nApplications will be made to the Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") and London Stock Exchange plc (the \"LSE\") respectively for the admission of the Offering Shares to listing in the equity shares (commercial companies) category of the Official List of the FCA and to trading on the main market for listed securities of the LSE (together, \"Admission\").

The person responsible for releasing this announcement on behalf of the Company is Liz Miles, Company Secretary.\nAston Martin today announces a strategic realignment of its 2024 wholesale volumes, making a circa 1,000 unit reduction to address disruption in its supply chain and continued macroeconomic weakness in China. In addition, the Company seeks to smooth the cadence of wholesale volumes over the coming quarters to deliver on its demand-led approach and maximise production efficiencies.\nThe Company is today providing updated guidance for Full Year 2024, with adjusted EBITDA now expected to be slightly below FY 2023 and no longer expecting to achieve positive free cash flow in H2'24.\nFrom now on, and for the first time in many years, Aston Martin will be in the enviable position of commencing the new year with a fully reinvigorated portfolio of ultra-luxury high performance models. This will support future growth with the Company remaining focused on achieving its previously communicated targets for FY 2025.\nOperational update\nExternal factors within the global automotive industry, including supply chain disruption and weak demand in China, are now impacting Aston Martin's volume outlook for the remainder of 2024. Concurrent with the significant ramp-up in production for the second half of the year, following new model introductions, the Company is experiencing a growing number of late component arrivals due to disruption at several of its suppliers. As a result, an increasing number of vehicles are taking longer to complete, with these issues impacting the efficiency of its operations and delaying the delivery of its vehicles.\nIn addition, a decision has been taken to strategically re-align planned volumes, in line with the Company's demand-led strategy, commitment to quality and optimised production processes.\u00a0The Company is addressing the supply chain challenges and continues to recognise the significant market opportunity that China represents as its macroeconomic environment improves.\nUpdated guidance\n\u00b7\nQ3 2024 wholesale volumes and adjusted EBITDA are now expected to be below current market expectations.\n\u00b7\nFY 2024 wholesale volumes are now expected to decline by high single digit percentage compared with FY 2023 (previously high single digit volume growth)\n\u00b7\nFY 2024 gross margin now expected to be modestly below 40% (previously targeting c. 40%)\n\u00b7\nFY 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin now in the high teen's percentage (previously low 20s%)\n\u00b7\nH2'24 free cash flow, while materially improved compared with H1'24, will remain negative (previously positive free cash flow generation in H2'24)\n\u00b7\nThe Company remains focused on achieving its previously communicated targets for FY 2025\nAdrian Hallmark, Aston Martin Chief Executive Officer commented:\n\"Having been with the Company for a month I am even more convinced than before in its growth potential. The team at Aston Martin has done an exceptional job in launching a fully reinvigorated core range of vehicles over the last 18 months.\n\"Near perfect execution was required to meet the Company's ambitious 2024 plan. However, it has become clear that we need to take decisive action to adjust our production volumes for 2024 given a combination of supplier disruption, the\nweak macroeconomic environment in China and a proactive decision to strategically re-align our production plans to optimise efficiency and achieve a more balanced delivery cadence in the future.\"\nLawrence Stroll, Executive Chairman Aston Martin commented:\n\"When the Yew Tree Consortium made its significant investment in Aston Martin in 2020, we did this with a long-term view of the necessary commitment and turnaround required to unlock the enormous value potential of this iconic brand.

Aston Martin fuses the latest technology, time honoured craftsmanship and beautiful styling to produce a range of critically acclaimed luxury models including the Vantage, DB12, DBS, DBX and its first hypercar, the Aston Martin Valkyrie. Aligned with its\nRacing. Green.\nsustainability strategy, Aston Martin is developing alternatives to the Internal Combustion Engine with a blended drivetrain approach between 2025 and 2030, including PHEV and BEV, with a clear plan to have a line-up of electric sports cars and SUVs.\nBased in Gaydon, England, Aston Martin Lagonda designs, creates, and exports cars which are sold in more than 50 countries around the world. Its sports cars are manufactured in Gaydon with its luxury DBX SUV range proudly manufactured in St Athan, Wales. The Company is on track to deliver net-zero manufacturing facilities by 2030.\nLagonda was founded in 1899 and came together with Aston Martin in 1947 when both were purchased by the late Sir David Brown, and the company is now listed on the London Stock Exchange as Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc.\n2020 saw Lawrence Stroll become the company's Executive Chairman, alongside significant new investment. This coincided with Aston Martin's return to the pinnacle of motorsport with the Aston Martin Aramco Formula One\u00ae Team and commenced a new era for the iconic British marque.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This will be underpinned by a significant ramp up in wholesale volumes including both the new V12 flagship Vanquish and ultra-exclusive Valiant Special, which we recently unveiled at Goodwood with Fernando Alonso.\n\"Our high performance products and ultra-luxury brand positioning strategies are creating strong demand amongst a new audience and existing loyal customers. Vantage's extremely positive media reception and reviews position it at the very top of the sports car segment, while the upgraded DBX707 with new interior and state of the art infotainment and the multi-award-winning DB12 underpin the strength of our next generation models. In tandem, Formula One\u00ae continues to drive considerable excitement and reappraisal of our brand with new and existing audiences.\n\"Earlier this year we successfully completed our planned refinancing, securing improved five-year terms following credit rating agency upgrades, and enhancing our liquidity through a new increased RCF provided by our existing lenders. We were also delighted to announce that Adrian Hallmark will become our new Chief Executive Officer. We have today confirmed his appointment will take effect on 1 September 2024, bringing unrivalled experience in both the ultra-luxury and British automotive sectors to further progress delivery of our strategic goals.\"\nAston Martin's management team will host a\nvideo\nwebcast presentation\nand live Q&A\nat 8am (BST) today.

The UK firm also said it is reviewing its strategy for future models as sales tumbled further in the face of pressure from US tariffs and weak demand in China. Aston Martin Lagonda told shareholders it will cut its five-year investment commitment from \u00a32 billion to \u00a31.7 billion as it launched a review into costs and capital expenditure. The car company, known for its association with the James Bond franchise, said it is also investing \u00a3350 million into its operations this year, in the latest cut to its spending plans. Earlier this month the company said it was on track for \u00a3375 million of investment, having already pulled back from a previous \u00a3400 million target. The company reported revenues had slid by 27% to \u00a3285.2 million for the quarter to September 30, compared with a year earlier. The drop was driven by weaker wholesale volumes, which fell by 13% to 1,430 vehicles for the quarter. The weakness was driven by \u201cheightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment\u201d which weighed down on demand, as well as pressure from US tariffs. Sales volumes were weaker than expected across \u201cmost regions\u201d during the quarter, as it reported that UK sales volumes slid by 32%.",

This is not a promise that historically has ended well.  While the Valhalla will help on the revenue side, how profitable it is, is an unknown.  In addition, the 999 production run is still well away from being sold out, after 7 years.  2026 is also an even number year, which based on the past precedent, means that it\u2019s time for Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll to change CEOs\u2026..again.

The rapid rise of Chinese brands has contributed to the sharp increase in EVs and plug-in hybrid sales \u2014 they increased their share of the UK\u2019s EV market to 12.8 per cent last year, compared with 8.5 per cent in 2024.",

As you gaze at your complimentary IG account, it's amusing to reflect on how AML has trended upward in the past and will likely do so again.

It seems your authenticity is about as genuine as a mirage, and the irony is that everyone else sees it too, yet you continue to post here with unabashed confidence!

No-one could be this dumb.\u201d @c2645sg \u2013 So, why not change your spots for once & simply admit your \u201860 + 10 + 90 = 160\u2019 RCF calculation was dumb? ;-) Have a good day everyone, cheers, Paul. :) PS @Stockcompass - Looking back over the last three months, there has been hardly any large daily trading volumes. https://www.lse.co.uk/SharePrice.html?shareprice=AML&share=Aston-Martin-Lagonda Even the peak volume of 4m+ shares on 29/10/25 represents just 0.4% of the 1bn+ AML shares in circulation.",

Aston Martin Lagonda told shareholders it will cut its five-year investment commitment from \u00a32 billion to \u00a31.7 billion as it launched a review into costs and capital expenditure. The car company, known for its association with the James Bond franchise, said it is also investing \u00a3350 million into its operations this year, in the latest cut to its spending plans. Earlier this month the company said it was on track for \u00a3375 million of investment, having already pulled back from a previous \u00a3400 million target. The company reported revenues had slid by 27% to \u00a3285.2 million for the quarter to September 30, compared with a year earlier. The drop was driven by weaker wholesale volumes, which fell by 13% to 1,430 vehicles for the quarter. The weakness was driven by \u201cheightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment\u201d which weighed down on demand, as well as pressure from US tariffs. Sales volumes were weaker than expected across \u201cmost regions\u201d during the quarter, as it reported that UK sales volumes slid by 32%.",

The rapid rise of Chinese brands has contributed to the sharp increase in EVs and plug-in hybrid sales \u2014 they increased their share of the UK\u2019s EV market to 12.8 per cent last year, compared with 8.5 per cent in 2024.",

I see you were trying to sound clever, but sadly, your words don\u2019t hold much weight for someone like me who has a deeper understanding & insight of trading. As you gaze at your complimentary IG account, it's amusing to reflect on how AML has trended upward in the past and will likely do so again. Have you ever been able to provide even a shred of constructive feedback? It seems your authenticity is about as genuine as a mirage, and the irony is that everyone else sees it too, yet you continue to post here with unabashed confidence!

Whereas, your posts claiming the RCF was \u00a310m at 30/06/25 have been shown, in your own words, to be \u201cfinancially illiterate\u201d.

The UK firm also said it is reviewing its strategy for future models as sales tumbled further in the face of pressure from US tariffs and weak demand in China. Aston Martin Lagonda told shareholders it will cut its five-year investment commitment from \u00a32 billion to \u00a31.7 billion as it launched a review into costs and capital expenditure. The car company, known for its association with the James Bond franchise, said it is also investing \u00a3350 million into its operations this year, in the latest cut to its spending plans. Earlier this month the company said it was on track for \u00a3375 million of investment, having already pulled back from a previous \u00a3400 million target. The company reported revenues had slid by 27% to \u00a3285.2 million for the quarter to September 30, compared with a year earlier. The drop was driven by weaker wholesale volumes, which fell by 13% to 1,430 vehicles for the quarter. The weakness was driven by \u201cheightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment\u201d which weighed down on demand, as well as pressure from US tariffs. Sales volumes were weaker than expected across \u201cmost regions\u201d during the quarter, as it reported that UK sales volumes slid by 32%.",

The first one, with the activation going on right now and in the coming months, would you expect to be fully sold for the 2026 build slots by the year-end of this year? What is your updated expectation for the full 999? And then the second question on the Valhalla is, just how many of the 150 deliveries in the guide for this year are earmarked for the U.S. if we do get an ongoing government shutdown there? Adrian Hallmark: Okay Harry, so I'll start with the easy one first. The number of cars going to the States is around 40 in the final quarter of this year. In respect to the government shutdown, the certification process that we have to run is complete. The documentation has all being submitted. And until about 10 days ago, we were still getting responses from them until they ran out of funding. So, it is tight. We no longer have a significant risk on quotas. We're not gleeful about this, but the unfortunate and critical situation that JLR found themselves in has probably taken significant pressure off the quota allocation risk for Q4. So yes, you're right, we now just still face the certification risk, but until a few days ago, we were still in active contact. The work has been done. The documents are submitted. So, we're cautiously optimistic that it will flow, and we should know in the coming weeks how that looks. In terms of the sellout of Valhalla, I mean it would be great if we could sell them all tomorrow. By the year-end, I think certainly, we will have sold the majority that will be available in 2026, because we've already sold most of them as we sit here today, if you add the total numbers up. And in terms of the 999, that's still a plan over the 2.5 year period, of all the cars in the marketplace. And we are encouraged by the fact we've got more than 50% of those sold before anybody saw the actual car or drove it. So, we have a high number of people that are currently specing, negotiating and finalising arrangements for the car. So, I won't predict exact numbers and exact dates, but it's looking positive as we open up the marketing channel.",

USA is AML\u2019s biggest market now, people hold off buying because of confusion over how much of a tariff they will pay. Plus the economy is slowing and interest  rates are still high. Then you have EV\u2019s complicating issues and taking sales away from AML. Nothing has changed, Aston is for a strange breed of fanboy who can\u2019t stand anything negative being said about Aston. That fanboy is dying out, and no one to replace them. Cash raise coming soon. Full year 2025 results are out at the end of February.",

It looks like Aston Martin will need to raise money shortly\u2026..again.   Positive cash flow will likely be promised in the 2nd half\u2026\u2026again.  This is not a promise that historically has ended well.  While the Valhalla will help on the revenue side, how profitable it is, is an unknown.  In addition, the 999 production run is still well away from being sold out, after 7 years.  2026 is also an even number year, which based on the past precedent, means that it\u2019s time for Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll to change CEOs\u2026..again.  Somehow Aston Martin will find a way to limp by.  The one thing we can count on, it will be entertaining\u2026..again.",

          "content": "Harry Martin (Bernstein): I have two questions on Valhalla to start with. The first one, with the activation going on right now and in the coming months, would you expect to be fully sold for the 2026 build slots by the year-end of this year? What is your updated expectation for the full 999? And then the second question on the Valhalla is, just how many of the 150 deliveries in the guide for this year are earmarked for the U.S. if we do get an ongoing government shutdown there? Adrian Hallmark: Okay Harry, so I'll start with the easy one first. The number of cars going to the States is around 40 in the final quarter of this year. In respect to the government shutdown, the certification process that we have to run is complete. The documentation has all being submitted. And until about 10 days ago, we were still getting responses from them until they ran out of funding. So, it is tight. We no longer have a significant risk on quotas. We're not gleeful about this, but the unfortunate and critical situation that JLR found themselves in has probably taken significant pressure off the quota allocation risk for Q4. So yes, you're right, we now just still face the certification risk, but until a few days ago, we were still in active contact. The work has been done. The documents are submitted. So, we're cautiously optimistic that it will flow, and we should know in the coming weeks how that looks. In terms of the sellout of Valhalla, I mean it would be great if we could sell them all tomorrow. By the year-end, I think certainly, we will have sold the majority that will be available in 2026, because we've already sold most of them as we sit here today, if you add the total numbers up. And in terms of the 999, that's still a plan over the 2.5 year period, of all the cars in the marketplace. And we are encouraged by the fact we've got more than 50% of those sold before anybody saw the actual car or drove it. So, we have a high number of people that are currently specing, negotiating and finalising arrangements for the car. So, I won't predict exact numbers and exact dates, but it's looking positive as we open up the marketing channel.",

          "content": "Harry Martin (Bernstein): I have two questions on Valhalla to start with. The first one, with the activation going on right now and in the coming months, would you expect to be fully sold for the 2026 build slots by the year-end of this year? What is your updated expectation for the full 999? And then the second question on the Valhalla is, just how many of the 150 deliveries in the guide for this year are earmarked for the U.S. if we do get an ongoing government shutdown there? Adrian Hallmark: Okay Harry, so I'll start with the easy one first. The number of cars going to the States is around 40 in the final quarter of this year. In respect to the government shutdown, the certification process that we have to run is complete. The documentation has all being submitted. And until about 10 days ago, we were still getting responses from them until they ran out of funding. So, it is tight. We no longer have a significant risk on quotas. We're not gleeful about this, but the unfortunate and critical situation that JLR found themselves in has probably taken significant pressure off the quota allocation risk for Q4. So yes, you're right, we now just still face the certification risk, but until a few days ago, we were still in active contact. The work has been done. The documents are submitted. So, we're cautiously optimistic that it will flow, and we should know in the coming weeks how that looks. In terms of the sellout of Valhalla, I mean it would be great if we could sell them all tomorrow. By the year-end, I think certainly, we will have sold the majority that will be available in 2026, because we've already sold most of them as we sit here today, if you add the total numbers up. And in terms of the 999, that's still a plan over the 2.5 year period, of all the cars in the marketplace. And we are encouraged by the fact we've got more than 50% of those sold before anybody saw the actual car or drove it. So, we have a high number of people that are currently specing, negotiating and finalising arrangements for the car. So, I won't predict exact numbers and exact dates, but it's looking positive as we open up the marketing channel.",

It expects a cash call on similar terms to the previous two, which were done at a \u00a32.3bn enterprise value. And there\u2019s more to come. JPMorgan, Aston Martin\u2019s joint house broker, forecasts \u00a3360mn of cash burn in 2025 and a further \u00a3230mn in the first half of 2026.\" That's a 1/3 of the current market cap, so a cash raise would be at 40p. Cash running out fast folks, beware of the rampers.",

I remain optimistic about their future and am glad to keep them in my portfolio. Yes, they\u2019ve faced some challenges recently, but history shows that companies undergoing such transformations typically require about five years to turn things around.

In 2025, 764,715 cars and vans were produced \u2014 15.5 per cent lower than the year before and the worst year since 1952 \u2014 according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on Thursday. Exports to Europe, the largest destination for vehicles manufactured in the UK, were down 3.3 per cent in 2025 against the year before, while those to the US and China were down 18 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively. In Britain in 2025, 717,371 cars were built, the lowest since 1956. The previous low since 1956 was recorded in 2022, when Covid caused supply-chain disruptions that hit production.",

The first one, with the activation going on right now and in the coming months, would you expect to be fully sold for the 2026 build slots by the year-end of this year? What is your updated expectation for the full 999? And then the second question on the Valhalla is, just how many of the 150 deliveries in the guide for this year are earmarked for the U.S. if we do get an ongoing government shutdown there? Adrian Hallmark: Okay Harry, so I'll start with the easy one first. The number of cars going to the States is around 40 in the final quarter of this year. In respect to the government shutdown, the certification process that we have to run is complete. The documentation has all being submitted. And until about 10 days ago, we were still getting responses from them until they ran out of funding. So, it is tight. We no longer have a significant risk on quotas. We're not gleeful about this, but the unfortunate and critical situation that JLR found themselves in has probably taken significant pressure off the quota allocation risk for Q4. So yes, you're right, we now just still face the certification risk, but until a few days ago, we were still in active contact. The work has been done. The documents are submitted. So, we're cautiously optimistic that it will flow, and we should know in the coming weeks how that looks. In terms of the sellout of Valhalla, I mean it would be great if we could sell them all tomorrow. By the year-end, I think certainly, we will have sold the majority that will be available in 2026, because we've already sold most of them as we sit here today, if you add the total numbers up. And in terms of the 999, that's still a plan over the 2.5 year period, of all the cars in the marketplace. And we are encouraged by the fact we've got more than 50% of those sold before anybody saw the actual car or drove it. So, we have a high number of people that are currently specing, negotiating and finalising arrangements for the car. So, I won't predict exact numbers and exact dates, but it's looking positive as we open up the marketing channel.",

A company simply wouldn\u2019t decide to reduce its workforce by a fifth unless it was certain that this wouldn\u2019t disrupt its daily operations. You seem a bit out of touch with the dynamics here. Before making such significant decisions, companies conduct thorough analyses to identify roles that are either redundant or manageable with fewer employees. This move is actually quite strategic as they can always bring back staff if the situation changes, but the stability of the company\u2019s operations remains intact! It's clear that your familiarity with this area\u2014or any area, really\u2014is a bit lacking. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

It was not that long ago they were on stop from some suppliers for late payment as they ran out of cash. Those suppliers will be watching AML cash at bank like hawks and if it looks like they will not be paid they will be cash upfront only suppliers. At that point it gets pretty sketchy. So there will be another cash raise and I suspect as many more as they can get away with before the bondholders take the lot leaving you Stocky with a big fat nothing.",

          "content": "Harry Martin (Bernstein): I have two questions on Valhalla to start with. The first one, with the activation going on right now and in the coming months, would you expect to be fully sold for the 2026 build slots by the year-end of this year? What is your updated expectation for the full 999? And then the second question on the Valhalla is, just how many of the 150 deliveries in the guide for this year are earmarked for the U.S. if we do get an ongoing government shutdown there? Adrian Hallmark: Okay Harry, so I'll start with the easy one first. The number of cars going to the States is around 40 in the final quarter of this year. In respect to the government shutdown, the certification process that we have to run is complete. The documentation has all being submitted. And until about 10 days ago, we were still getting responses from them until they ran out of funding. So, it is tight. We no longer have a significant risk on quotas. We're not gleeful about this, but the unfortunate and critical situation that JLR found themselves in has probably taken significant pressure off the quota allocation risk for Q4. So yes, you're right, we now just still face the certification risk, but until a few days ago, we were still in active contact. The work has been done. The documents are submitted. So, we're cautiously optimistic that it will flow, and we should know in the coming weeks how that looks. In terms of the sellout of Valhalla, I mean it would be great if we could sell them all tomorrow. By the year-end, I think certainly, we will have sold the majority that will be available in 2026, because we've already sold most of them as we sit here today, if you add the total numbers up. And in terms of the 999, that's still a plan over the 2.5 year period, of all the cars in the marketplace. And we are encouraged by the fact we've got more than 50% of those sold before anybody saw the actual car or drove it. So, we have a high number of people that are currently specing, negotiating and finalising arrangements for the car. So, I won't predict exact numbers and exact dates, but it's looking positive as we open up the marketing channel.",

This move is actually quite strategic as they can always bring back staff if the situation changes, but the stability of the company\u2019s operations remains intact!

The first one, with the activation going on right now and in the coming months, would you expect to be fully sold for the 2026 build slots by the year-end of this year? What is your updated expectation for the full 999? And then the second question on the Valhalla is, just how many of the 150 deliveries in the guide for this year are earmarked for the U.S. if we do get an ongoing government shutdown there? Adrian Hallmark: Okay Harry, so I'll start with the easy one first. The number of cars going to the States is around 40 in the final quarter of this year. In respect to the government shutdown, the certification process that we have to run is complete. The documentation has all being submitted. And until about 10 days ago, we were still getting responses from them until they ran out of funding. So, it is tight. We no longer have a significant risk on quotas. We're not gleeful about this, but the unfortunate and critical situation that JLR found themselves in has probably taken significant pressure off the quota allocation risk for Q4. So yes, you're right, we now just still face the certification risk, but until a few days ago, we were still in active contact. The work has been done. The documents are submitted. So, we're cautiously optimistic that it will flow, and we should know in the coming weeks how that looks. In terms of the sellout of Valhalla, I mean it would be great if we could sell them all tomorrow. By the year-end, I think certainly, we will have sold the majority that will be available in 2026, because we've already sold most of them as we sit here today, if you add the total numbers up. And in terms of the 999, that's still a plan over the 2.5 year period, of all the cars in the marketplace. And we are encouraged by the fact we've got more than 50% of those sold before anybody saw the actual car or drove it. So, we have a high number of people that are currently specing, negotiating and finalising arrangements for the car. So, I won't predict exact numbers and exact dates, but it's looking positive as we open up the marketing channel.",

It looks like Aston Martin will need to raise money shortly\u2026..again.   Positive cash flow will likely be promised in the 2nd half\u2026\u2026again.  This is not a promise that historically has ended well.  While the Valhalla will help on the revenue side, how profitable it is, is an unknown.  In addition, the 999 production run is still well away from being sold out, after 7 years.  2026 is also an even number year, which based on the past precedent, means that it\u2019s time for Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll to change CEOs\u2026..again.  Somehow Aston Martin will find a way to limp by.  The one thing we can count on, it will be entertaining\u2026..again.",

I'll leave it up to the readers to decide which one. Either way, you offer nothing, you're more obsessed with me than AML shares it seems. I won't bother resounding any more, it's futile.
