Beyond its substantial economic impact-such as job creation and tax revenues-the project plays a crucial role in establishing in\nAngola\na key segment of the value chain for an industry essential to the global energy transition.\nAs a key investor, FSDEA has been instrumental in demonstrating the untapped potential of\nAngola's\nmining sector, which remains a critical driver of economic diversification.

These minerals are essential for high-tech industries, from semiconductors to advanced batteries and renewable energy solutions. At AFC, we recognize the immense strategic value of\nAfrica's\nresources-not just for our economic transformation but for securing diversified, sustainable supply chains for the future. Our partnership with Pensana and FSDEA on the Longonjo project reflects our unwavering commitment to unlocking\nAfrica's\nmineral potential through local value addition, industrial growth, and responsible mining. By investing in\nAfrica's\nrare earth sector, we are not only accelerating regional development but also strengthening global energy security in line with the aspirations of the Mineral Security Partnership.\"\nPensana Chairman,\nPaul Atherley\n, commented:\n\"We are extremely grateful for the work undertaken by the\nAFC\nand FSDEA\nteams\nin providing the Longonjo project with\nthe\nfunding requirements\nfor the Longonjo project.\nThe Longonjo project\nwill\nproduce an average of around 20,000 tonnes per annum of clean high value MREC and will\nhave a major positive impact on the community,\ncreating\nover\n430 high value processing jobs.

At the time of writing this report I am delighted to confirm that both ABSA Bank Limited (\u201cABSA\u201d) and the Africa Finance Corporation (\u201cAFC\u201d), alongside our highly supportive and largest shareholder, the Angolan Sovereign Wealth fund (\u201cFSDEA\u201d), have now completed their requisite credit approval processes thereby allowing the team to initiate the move to main construction on the Longonjo Project.\nIn the build up to this key financing event, FSDEA\u2019s\nUS$15 million\nbridging facility continued to provide the impetus on-site over this period. Having now fully deployed these funds I am pleased to confirm completion of the accommodation camp (including all underground and surface infrastructure encompassing electrical reticulation, water supply, effluent services and storm water management), the upgrade of the access road to the Longonjo railway station, contractor laydown areas and the agricultural demonstration plots under the Land Restitution Programme.\nWe are particularly pleased with the progress by the management of the Lobito Atlantic Rail Consortium (LARC) who now have assumed full operational control of the freight services along the rail corridor to the port. Serving as the primary route for inbound materials and reagents, and the export of ultra-clean Mixed Rare Earth Carbonate product (\u201cMREC\u201d), LARC\u2019s management is a further de-risking of the logistics chain that will serve the mine site.\nWe have a strong owners team supporting the main construction led by\nKevin Botha\n, with supervision of all project deliverables by Mining Consultancy Company Limited (MCC), a veteran project management team with a track record of delivering projects across\nAfrica\n, including\nAngola\n. The engineering team is supported by ADP Group and ProProcess, both being African minerals specialists in the detailed design, construction and commissioning of modular mineral processing plants with extensive development experience in\nAngola\n. Additionally, our team within\nAngola\ncontinue to develop and progress in their careers with internal merit-based promotions of Angolan nationals to management positions in the roles of country manager (Geraldine Tchimbali) and site manager (\nBenedito Dumbo\n) during the past year. Stakeholder engagement continues apace with regular meetings taking place over the period between the project team and key stakeholders.
