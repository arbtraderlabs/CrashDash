The programme is designed to provide both detailed geological and grade control information ahead of the commencement of mining and stockpiling/blending activities in early 2027 alongside the resource expansion drilling programme announced on 17 November 2025.\nTwo reverse circulation drilling rigs are planned to be mobilised ahead of drilling activities throughout the anticipated dry season from May through to October 2026. The programme anticipates completion of a 10 x 10 metre drill grid across the weathered run-of-mine from the initial pit(s) production zones/areas.\nThe Longonjo deposit comprises a near-surface blanket of high-grade, NdPr-rich total rare earth oxides (TREO), with an average depth of approximately 30 metres. Previous drilling has confirmed that mineralisation extends to depths in excess of 100 metres beneath the current resource, indicating significant potential to increase the resource base through further drilling.\nDuring the campaign samples will also be collected at depth to develop a detailed understanding of the full vertical extent of the mineralization and support assessment of the potential for an increase in inferred resources from the existing 313 million tonnes at 1.43% TREO towards one billion tonnes at a similar grade - which would make it one of the world's largest rare earth deposits currently in development .\nA laboratory is being procured for delivery to site alongside drill rig mobilisation. This containerised unit will include sample preparation facilities and an automated XRF analyser enabling timeous and cost saving multi-element analysis on site. Grade control drilling will be ongoing for most of the Longonjo life of mine, staying a year ahead of mine planning.\nThese results will further support the current mine and stockpile blending plan developed with Practara, well before commissioning, and enhances the existing dataset.\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is developing one of the world's largest and highest-grade magnet metal rare earth deposits which will produce initially 20,000 tpa of a clean high value MREC including both LREE and HREE. The plan is to expand production to 40,000 tpa of MREC once initial operations have been established.\nThe Longonjo operation will extract, concentrate, calcine and chemically refine the free dig material to produce a high-value MREC which will be railed 273 kilometers in containers to the Atlantic port of Lobito for export.\nPensana is looking to establish a world class fully integrated mine-to-magnet supply chain in partnership with US partners and with backing from U.S. Government.\nThe Longonjo rare earths deposit is located adjacent to the Lobito rail corridor approximately 60 kilometers west of the provincial capital of Huambo in central Angola.\nThe project currently under development comprises an open pit, concentrator and recovery plants, tailings storage facility (designed to meet the requirements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management), process water supply, bulk power supply, mine infrastructure, workshops, offices, accommodation village, recreational facilities, and other associated infrastructure.\nThe information contained within this announcement is considered by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No.596/2014.

Whilst there is still much to do there is a growing sense of achievement as the project rapidly emerges.\"\nPictures of the site construction activities are available on the Company's website\nwww.pensana.co.uk\nHighlights include:\nGrupo Nov, the Angolan civil and earthworks company already involved in the Longonjo early works program, has completed site preparation and has commenced construction of the SRK designed Tailings Storage Facility according to Global Industry Standards on Tailings Management,\nThe concrete batching plant has been established to provide for the civils and piling works required for the senior load bearing foundations of major equipment items on the compacted process plant terrace area,\nNCP has completed fabrication of the 2 MW regrind circuit ball mill which awaits delivery to site once foundations are complete during the next quarter,\nClark in Brazil has commenced construction of the 250 tonne-per-day modular sulphuric acid plant after the completion of the Hazard and Operability Study review in late 2025,\nProcurement of all long lead items has been enabled to meet the targeted construction and budget schedules post conclusion of the detailed design processes by Lycopodium and Pro Process,\nFollowing procurement completion of the balance of the major capital items including flotation columns, calciner, thickeners and nano-filtration units, all detailed design and fabrication schedules remain on track for delivery from the respective vendors,\nAdditional plant storage and laydown areas have been completed ahead of deliveries and installation due from mid-2026 onwards, and\nRegional government recognition and awards have been received for the Company's positive economic and social impact, including community outreach programmes guided by IFC and Equator Principles risk management compliance.\nPermanent power, potable water, wastewater treatment, telecommunications, and site security infra-structure were installed and commissioned in 2025. This infrastructure is now able to fully support the growing construction workforce as the project executes the large-scale construction workstreams through 2026 under the leadership of Country Manager Geraldine Tchimbali.\nSafety remains a core strength of the on-site team, underpinned by a sustainability-led owner-operator approach and close collaboration with quality engineering and delivery partners to reduce risk. The project continues to follow a modular construction philosophy within the detailed design process to maintain construction schedule certainty and reducing risk associated with on-site implementation.\nAs the on-site workforce increases towards the peak of 750 on-site personnel, the Company is actively encouraging integration with the surrounding community through the use of local accommodation, services, and established transport links to nearby towns.\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is developing one of the world's largest and highest-grade magnet metal rare earth deposits which will produce initially 20,000 tpa of a clean high value MREC including both LREE and HREE. The plan is to expand production to 40,000 tpa of MREC once initial operations have been established.\nThe Longonjo operation will extract, concentrate, calcine and chemically refine the free dig material to produce a high-value MREC which will be railed 273km in containers to the Atlantic port of Lobito for export.\nPensana is looking to establish a world class fully integrated U.S. Mine-to-magnet supply chain in partnership with eVAC magnetics South Carolina with backing from U.S. Government.\nThe Longonjo rare earths deposit is located adjacent to the Lobito rail Corridor approximately 60 km west of the provincial capital of Huambo i",

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo.\nThe Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026.\nM&G, the Company's second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company's plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025.\nPaul Atherley Pensana Chairman commented:\n\"\nWe very much welcome the ongoing support from the Company's two largest shareholders for the U.S. focused mine to magnet strategy and for the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. The integration of Longonjo into a world class major mine to magnet supply chain via the Lobito Corridor has the potential to put Angola on the map as a major long term and reliable supplier of rare earths at a time when the US is looking to realign dependency away from a single source.\"\nSummary of the terms of the Transaction\nConversion\nPursuant to the US$15 million bridging loan entered into between the Company and FSDEA's wholly owned subsidiary, ASF Yova Mining Holding Limited (\"ASF Yova\"), on 7 August 2023 (\"the Facility\"), the Company and ASF Yova have agreed that 50% of the US$15 million principal debt outstanding under the Facility will be converted into new ordinary shares in the Company. The conversion price will be 24 pence resulting in 23,148,148 conversion shares. Following admission, ASF Yova will hold 98,686,785 of the Company's issued ordinary share capital, approximately 29.2 per cent shareholding.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing admission of the 23,148,148 new ordinary shares, the Company's issued share capital will be 338,114,583 ordinary shares.\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is focused on developing a mine-to-magnet rare earth supply chain to support the growth of industries including robotics, artificial intelligence, electrification and advanced manufacturing. Through strategic partnerships and investment, the Company aims to provide the critical mineral resources required by the United States and its allies to underpin industrial growth.\nPensana has spent US$ 70 million over the past six years on exploration, technical and environmental studies on the Longonjo rare earth project in the Huambo district of Angola approximately 350 kilometres Southeast of the capital Luanda.\nThe Company has successfully delineated a near surface JORC compliant reserve of 22 million tonnes grading 3.04% TREO containing 139,457 tonnes of NdPrO making it one of the world's largest and highest grade, undeveloped magnet metal rare earth deposits with a projected mine life of over 20 years.\nThe Phase 1 production will be 20,000 tonnes of a highly marketable clean MREC. The proposed second phase expansion will see production increase to 40,000 tonnes of MREC per annum which would represent around 5% of the world's production capable of being converted into permanent magnets for electric vehicles and offshore wind turbines (based on current reported global production).\nThe investment by Pensana in Longonjo is expected to generate hundreds of local high value jobs, give work to many local businesses and, once in production, will generate substantial fiscal returns for the Government of Angola. The downstream development of the mine and processing facilities to a mixed rare earth carbonate go beyond the conventional dig and ship approach.\nThe Company is committed to developing the Longonjo mine to the very best international standards with the highest level of community engagement and has published a blueprint for sustainable rare earth development which is available on our website.\nPensana_Blueprint_for_Sustainable_Rare_Earths.pdf\nThe team's efforts were recognised in 2022 when Pensana received green bond assurance by S&P Green Bond Rating Agency CICERO and more recently were awarded a Gold M",

Our offtake partners have been clear about their requirements and in response this circuit upgrade will further enhance Longonjo's importance within the rare earth landscape. \"\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is focused on developing a mine-to-magnet rare earth supply chain to support the growth of industries including robotics, artificial intelligence, electrification and advanced manufacturing. Through strategic partnerships and investment, the Company aims to provide the critical mineral resources required by the United States and its allies to underpin industrial growth.\nPensana has spent US$70 million over the past six years on exploration, technical and environmental studies on the Longonjo rare earth project in the Huambo district of Angola approximately 350 kilometres Southeast of the capital Luanda.\nThe Company has successfully delineated a near surface JORC compliant reserve of 22 million tonnes grading 3.04% TREO containing 139,457 tonnes of NdPrO making it one of the world's largest and highest grade, undeveloped magnet metal rare earth deposits with a projected mine life of over 20 years.\nThe Phase 1 production will be 20,000 tonnes of a highly marketable clean MREC. The proposed second phase expansion will see production increase to 40,000 tonnes of MREC per annum which would represent around 5% of the world's production capable of being converted into permanent magnets for electric vehicles and offshore wind turbines (based on current reported global production).\nThe investment by Pensana in Longonjo is expected to generate hundreds of local high value jobs, give work to many local businesses and, once in production, will generate substantial fiscal returns for the Government of Angola. The downstream development of the mine and processing facilities to a mixed rare earth carbonate go beyond the conventional dig and ship approach.\nThe Company is committed to developing the Longonjo mine to the very best international standards with the highest level of community engagement and has published a blueprint for sustainable rare earth development which is available on our website.\nPensana_Blueprint_for_Sustainable_Rare_Earths.pdf\nThe team's efforts were recognised in 2022 when Pensana received green bond assurance by S&P Green Bond Rating Agency CICERO and more recently were awarded a Gold Medal by EcoVadis, a leading sustainability ratings provider, placing it among the top 5% of the companies assessed.\nThe information contained within this announcement is considered by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No.596/2014.

Previous drilling has confirmed that the mineralisation continues to well over 100 metres directly beneath the current resource indicating the potential for substantially increasing resources with further drilling.\nA 25,000-metre vertical core drilling programme has been planned which aims to extend the existing JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate from 313 million tonnes at 1.43% TREO to over one billion tonnes at a similar grade.\nMetallurgical sampling and testwork will be undertaken for mine planning and processing optimisation. The programme is scheduled to commence early in the new year with results released as they become available.\nPaul Atherley Chairman commented:\n\"Following the recent announcement that China is looking to establish a major rare earth processing hub to boost mining, refining and magnet production at the world's largest rare earth mine at Bayan Obu in Inner Mongolia, further strengthening China's position as the world's major producer, it is clear that large scale, cost efficient, fully integrated supply chains are set to dominate the industry.\nWe are fortunate that the style of mineralisation at Longonjo is known to have very significant depth extensions and we are very confident that this programme will rapidly deliver a substantial increase to our already world-class resource inventory. Longonjo benefits from the ongoing multi-billion dollar investments into the Lobito Corridor rail, hydro-electric power and port facilities enabling it to rapidly scale up production to meet the growing demand from the U.S.\nOur recent partnership with eVAC to establish a world class integrated mine-to-magnet supply chain in the U.S. will see Longonjo supply the recently commissioned advanced magnetics facility at Sumter in South Carolina with feedstock, initially to produce 2,000 tonnes of magnets rising to 12,000 tonnes per year in 2029, making eVAC one of the world's largest producers underpinned by a world class long life resource base at Longonjo. This major new fully integrated mine to magnet supply chain is expected to capture the interest of major offtake partners looking to reduce their exposure to China's export controls.\"\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is focused on developing a mine-to-magnet rare earth supply chain to support the growth of industries including robotics, artificial intelligence, electrification and advanced manufacturing. Through strategic partnerships and investment, the Company aims to provide the critical mineral resources required by the United States and its allies to underpin industrial growth.\nPensana has spent US$ 70 million over the past six years on exploration, technical and environmental studies on the Longonjo rare earth project in the Huambo district of Angola approximately 350 kilometres Southeast of the capital Luanda.\nThe Company has successfully delineated a near surface JORC compliant reserve of 22 million tonnes grading 3.04% TREO containing 139,457 tonnes of NdPrO making it one of the world's largest and highest grade, undeveloped magnet metal rare earth deposits with a projected mine life of over 20 years.\nThe Phase 1 production will be 20,000 tonnes of a highly marketable clean MREC.

reserve estimate and an update on the project delivery for the Longonjo rare earth project in\nAngola\n.\nThe highlights are as follows:\nThe updated JORC compliant ore reserve grade has increased to 3.04% TREO containing 139,000 tonnes of NdPr oxide for a mine life of over 20 years making it one of the largest and highest-grade undeveloped magnet metal projects worldwide.\nThe plant will process 800,000 tonnes per annum with a feed grade for the first five years of 4.12% TREO with a very low strip ratio of 0.25 tonnes of waste for each tonne of ore mined.\nBenefitting from the excellent infrastructure in the region the capital cost at\nUS$217 million\n, including contingency, is one of the lowest capital intensities for a rare earth project of this scale.\nWith the site infrastructure and access road already in place and the mobilisation of contractors underway the main construction of the modularised process plant is expected to commence in the coming weeks.\nInitial production of 20,000 tonnes per annum of clean, highly marketable mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) is due to commence in late 2026.\nThe Company has received considerable interest in offtake for the stage one production of 20,000 tonnes per annum of MREC and has received expressions of interest in the proposed expansion tonnage of 40,000 tonnes per annum.\nThe technical due diligence carried out by independent technical consultants on behalf of the lender consortium has reported the following updated JORC compliant ore reserve estimate.\nORE RESERVE

In addition to the\nUS$15.0 million\nbridging loan already provided by FSDEA, the funding approvals received include equity financed by FSDEA of\nUS$38.0 million\ncomprising equity and a convertible loan, as well as\nUS$54.9 million\nfrom AFC in the form of a convertible loan. The debt funding, which comprises approximately 60% of Phase 1 project funding for Longonjo, includes participation by AFC of\nUS$81.2 million\nand ABSA of\nUS$78.8 million\n, all at a subsidiary level.\nCEO\u2019s Review\nDear Pensana Shareholders,\nHaving prepared the Longonjo site for main construction over the period our attention was predominantly focussed on any additional due diligence workstreams the Lender group required as they progressed through the multiple stages of their credit approval processes. At the time of writing this report I am delighted to confirm that both ABSA Bank Limited (\u201cABSA\u201d) and the Africa Finance Corporation (\u201cAFC\u201d), alongside our highly supportive and largest shareholder, the Angolan Sovereign Wealth fund (\u201cFSDEA\u201d), have now completed their requisite credit approval processes thereby allowing the team to initiate the move to main construction on the Longonjo Project.\nIn the build up to this key financing event, FSDEA\u2019s\nUS$15 million\nbridging facility continued to provide the impetus on-site over this period. Having now fully deployed these funds I am pleased to confirm completion of the accommodation camp (including all underground and surface infrastructure encompassing electrical reticulation, water supply, effluent services and storm water management), the upgrade of the access road to the Longonjo railway station, contractor laydown areas and the agricultural demonstration plots under the Land Restitution Programme.\nWe are particularly pleased with the progress by the management of the Lobito Atlantic Rail Consortium (LARC) who now have assumed full operational control of the freight services along the rail corridor to the port. Serving as the primary route for inbound materials and reagents, and the export of ultra-clean Mixed Rare Earth Carbonate product (\u201cMREC\u201d), LARC\u2019s management is a further de-risking of the logistics chain that will serve the mine site.\nWe have a strong owners team supporting the main construction led by\nKevin Botha\n, with supervision of all project deliverables by Mining Consultancy Company Limited (MCC), a veteran project management team with a track record of delivering projects across\nAfrica\n, including\nAngola\n. The engineering team is supported by ADP Group and ProProcess, both being African minerals specialists in the detailed design, construction and commissioning of modular mineral processing plants with extensive development experience in\nAngola\n. Additionally, our team within\nAngola\ncontinue to develop and progress in their careers with internal merit-based promotions of Angolan nationals to management positions in the roles of country manager (Geraldine Tchimbali) and site manager (\nBenedito Dumbo\n) during the past year. Stakeholder engagement continues apace with regular meetings taking place over the period between the project team and key stakeholders. This includes local, provincial and national authorities, transitional leade",

With the support of ABSA and AFC, this initiative represents a concerted effort to foster sustainable growth, enhance local capabilities, and reinforce\nAngola's\nposition in the international mining landscape\".\nPresident & CEO of Africa Finance Corporation, Samaila Zubairu, commented:\n\"With approximately one-third of the world's rare earth mineral reserves,\nAfrica\nis poised to become a cornerstone of the global clean energy revolution. These minerals are essential for high-tech industries, from semiconductors to advanced batteries and renewable energy solutions. At AFC, we recognize the immense strategic value of\nAfrica's\nresources-not just for our economic transformation but for securing diversified, sustainable supply chains for the future. Our partnership with Pensana and FSDEA on the Longonjo project reflects our unwavering commitment to unlocking\nAfrica's\nmineral potential through local value addition, industrial growth, and responsible mining. By investing in\nAfrica's\nrare earth sector, we are not only accelerating regional development but also strengthening global energy security in line with the aspirations of the Mineral Security Partnership.\"\nPensana Chairman,\nPaul Atherley\n, commented:\n\"We are extremely grateful for the work undertaken by the\nAFC\nand FSDEA\nteams\nin providing the Longonjo project with\nthe\nfunding requirements\nfor the Longonjo project.\nThe Longonjo project\nwill\nproduce an average of around 20,000 tonnes per annum of clean high value MREC and will\nhave a major positive impact on the community,\ncreating\nover\n430 high value processing jobs. Over 50% of the jobs created are expected to be allocated to young people\nas well as\nsupporting local businesses, service providers\nand farmers.\nOnce in full\nsecond phase production,\nthe\nproject\nwill create an estimated 2,400\ndirect and\nindirect jobs\nand\nwill\nproduce around 5% of the world's\nmagnet metal rare earths\nused for\ndiverse applications including\nwind turbines and electric vehicles.\"\nAbout Longonjo\nPensana has spent over\nUS$70 million\nover the past six years on exploration, technical and environmental studies on the Longonjo rare earth project in the Huambo district of\nAngola\napproximately 350 kilometres Southeast of the capital\nLuanda\n.\nThe Company has successfully delineated a near surface\nJORC compliant reserve of 30 million tonnes grading 2.55% TREO containing 166,000 tonnes of NdPrO has been delineated making it one of the world's largest undeveloped magnet metal rare earth deposits with a mine life of over 20 years.\nThe electrification of motive power is arguably the biggest energy transition in history and needs rare earths for permanent magnets.\nOnce in full second phase production the mine will pr",

The programme is designed to provide both detailed geological and grade control information ahead of the commencement of mining and stockpiling/blending activities in early 2027 alongside the resource expansion drilling programme announced on 17 November 2025.\nTwo reverse circulation drilling rigs are planned to be mobilised ahead of drilling activities throughout the anticipated dry season from May through to October 2026. The programme anticipates completion of a 10 x 10 metre drill grid across the weathered run-of-mine from the initial pit(s) production zones/areas.\nThe Longonjo deposit comprises a near-surface blanket of high-grade, NdPr-rich total rare earth oxides (TREO), with an average depth of approximately 30 metres. Previous drilling has confirmed that mineralisation extends to depths in excess of 100 metres beneath the current resource, indicating significant potential to increase the resource base through further drilling.\nDuring the campaign samples will also be collected at depth to develop a detailed understanding of the full vertical extent of the mineralization and support assessment of the potential for an increase in inferred resources from the existing 313 million tonnes at 1.43% TREO towards one billion tonnes at a similar grade - which would make it one of the world's largest rare earth deposits currently in development .\nA laboratory is being procured for delivery to site alongside drill rig mobilisation. This containerised unit will include sample preparation facilities and an automated XRF analyser enabling timeous and cost saving multi-element analysis on site. Grade control drilling will be ongoing for most of the Longonjo life of mine, staying a year ahead of mine planning.\nThese results will further support the current mine and stockpile blending plan developed with Practara, well before commissioning, and enhances the existing dataset.\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is developing one of the world's largest and highest-grade magnet metal rare earth deposits which will produce initially 20,000 tpa of a clean high value MREC including both LREE and HREE. The plan is to expand production to 40,000 tpa of MREC once initial operations have been established.\nThe Longonjo operation will extract, concentrate, calcine and chemically refine the free dig material to produce a high-value MREC which will be railed 273 kilometers in containers to the Atlantic port of Lobito for export.\nPensana is looking to establish a world class fully integrated mine-to-magnet supply chain in partnership with US partners and with backing from U.S. Government.\nThe Longonjo rare earths deposit is located adjacent to the Lobito rail corridor approximately 60 kilometers west of the provincial capital of Huambo in central Angola.\nThe project currently under development comprises an open pit, concentrator and recovery plants, tailings storage facility (designed to meet the requirements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management), process water supply, bulk power supply, mine infrastructure, workshops, offices, accommodation village, recreational facilities, and other associated infrastructure.\nThe information contained within this announcement is considered by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No.596/2014.

          "content": "When a company applies to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the standard minimum bid price requirement is $4.00 per share. However, Nasdaq\u2019s rules provide an alternative based on the company\u2019s closing price \u2014 allowing companies to qualify with a $3.00 or $2.00 closing price instead of the $4 minimum bid price \u2014 if the company also meets additional, specific financial and listing criteria. Here\u2019s how the varying requirements work for the closing price alternatives: \ud83d\udcc9 1) $3.00 Closing Price Alternative A company may list with a minimum closing price of $3.00 per share (for at least 5 consecutive business days prior to Nasdaq approval) if it meets the Equity or Net Income listing standards. In addition to the closing price test, the company must satisfy the other required financial and liquidity criteria under those standards: Equity Standard Example Requirements Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $5 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $15 million Operating history: At least 2 years Net Income Standard Example Requirements Net income: At least $750,000 in the most recent fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $4 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $5 million Under either standard, the closing price of $3.00 must be maintained for at least five consecutive business days before Nasdaq will approve the listing under this alternative. \ud83d\udcc9 2) $2.00 Closing Price Alternative A company may list with a minimum closing price of $2.00 per share (also for at least 5 consecutive business days prior to approval) if it meets the Market Value of Listed Securities standard instead of the Equity or Net Income standards. This is generally viewed as a somewhat less demanding alternative in terms of profitability or operating history, but requires overall market value size. It also carries more stringent asset/value thresholds: Market Value of Listed Securities Standard Example Requirements Market value of listed securities: At least $50 million Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $4 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $15 million Again, the $2 closing price condition must be sustained for a minimum of five consecutive business days before Nasdaq will grant listing approval under this alternative.",

          "content": "Here\u2019s how the Nasdaq closing-price alternative checklist would apply to Pensana Rare Earths PLC (the London-listed company planning a U.S. listing, often reported as targeting Nasdaq in 2026) \u2014 based on the latest available financial and market data: \ud83d\udccc 1) Current Share Price & Market Context Pensana\u2019s London share price recently traded around ~84\u201388 pence (about \u00a30.84\u2013\u00a30.88), and a share consolidation is being proposed to align its share price with Nasdaq eligibility standards. Pensana is also trading OTC in the U.S. under tickers like PNSPF / PNSNF, with a U.S. market cap previously estimated around ~$480 m (data from late 2025). \ud83d\udc49 Implication: The share consolidation proposal strongly suggests management is aware that the company\u2019s pre-consolidation per-share price may be below Nasdaq\u2019s usual minimums \u2014 especially if they want to avoid needing a very low price exception \u2014 although consolidated price targets haven\u2019t been publicly confirmed. \ud83d\udcc9 2) $3.00 or $2.00 Closing Price Eligibility To qualify under Nasdaq\u2019s closing price alternatives instead of the standard $4.00 minimum bid price, Pensana would need to meet specific conditions: \ud83d\udd39 $3.00 Closing Price Alternative (To use a $3 closing price instead of $4) Checklist: \u2610 Closing share price \u2265 $3.00 for 5 consecutive business days \u2610 Qualify under either: Equity Standard (e.g., \u2265 $5 m equity + \u2265 $15 m public float; operating history) Net Income Standard (positive or qualifying profitability + equity & float) Pensana Status: Pensana is currently unprofitable (net losses) with no positive net income reported and no revenue as it remains in development. Stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet appears positive but modest relative to Nasdaq thresholds (equity around tens of millions of dollars), but detailed audited figures vs Nasdaq thresholds aren\u2019t public. Market value of unrestricted public float likely meets Nasdaq thresholds when aggregated across U.S. OTC + LSE ownership if consolidated shares lift per-share value. (Estimates vary depending on currency and exchange rates.) \ud83d\udc49 Result: Qualifying under the $3 closing price standard seems challenging because Pensana does not currently meet a Net Income Standard and the Equity Standard (while perhaps technically possible if equity and float are adequate) still requires the $3 share price before Nasdaq will approve the alternative. Management\u2019s share consolidation indicates ongoing work to meet that price threshold. \ud83d\udd39 $2.00 Closing Price Alternative (To use a $2 closing price instead of $4) Checklist: \u2610 Closing price \u2265 $2.00 for 5 consecutive business days \u2610 Qualify under Market Value of Listed Securities Standard: \u2265 $50 m market value of listed securities \u2265 $4 m stockholders\u2019 equity \u2265 $15 m unrestricted float value Pensana Status: Pensana\u2019s current LSE market cap is likely well over $50 m, and combined with an OTC valuation could satisfy the $50 m",

Equity is positive, though at development stage and dependent on audited statements; it appears above the minimum. Unrestricted float thresholds are plausibly met given wide institutional and public holdings if share consolidation increases per-share price. \ud83d\udc49 Result: The $2.00 closing price alternative is the most realistic Nasdaq path for Pensana \u2014 but only if: The post-consolidation share price stays \u2265 $2 for at least five consecutive business days, and The company satisfies the Market Value of Listed Securities Standard (which hinges on total float and audited equity figures).",

I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

My friendly AI chatbot assures me that: \"The average time for a mining company to receive assay results after finishing a drilling program is typically several weeks to several months, commonly ranging from 3 to 12 weeks\" So here we are almost exactly 12 weeks on - every reason to believe the results are already in the bag, back at Pensana HQ, wherever that might be. Any views on what Pensana might do about announcing them,  if the results are good or if they are bad, in view of the current (depressed and depressing) SP and the upcoming Nasdaq float? The other drilling survey (Longonjo reserve enhancement) announced mid-Nov 25 starts around now in early 2026, but Pensana isn't going to wait till all the those results come in, but plans to strategically 'drip-feed' results, released throughout 2026 as they become available, or more likely - when the time is right..",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem.

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

          "content": "Novice - I doubt very much if  \"making stuff up as they go along\" is going to keep Pensana's sponsors of the  Coola/Sulima West project happy. In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

That's my understanding anyway, unless anyone knows differently? I think it's best to just focus on prospects for the 'organic' share price, personally.",

That's 40,000 tons = the total output of both Phases 1 and 2. So how can they then announce a further offtake with the German Vacuumwhatever company?? * Earlier this year the Angolan wealth fund was issued shares in the Ozanga subsidiary which was stated at that time as being 84% owned by Pensana. Has that 84% now been decreased due to dilution at project level, or is the 84% fixed? Will there be dilution in future? What %age of the Longonjo project will Pensana eventually own?

          "content": "Hulkm & Cybberbub ~ Depending upon where your own interests lie, you are both correct. From a purely technical viewpoint, there are three main drivers to every Mining company's Share price at any given time: 1) The fundamental physical aspects of a mines operations such as: Logistics, Orebody, Process and Commodity economics. 2) Market Sentiment ie the Public's capacity, desire and appetite to be involved and 3) Manipulation by entities with ulterior motives ie China, Brokers, Traders, Competitors and Sharks. In Pensana's case, Fundamentals are pretty much down to the BOD's ability to identify and execute the development of Longonjo. We know the deposit is there and that there is going to be a strong demand for our product. The Geo-political aspects are sound, and the economics are improving rapidly on multiple fronts. The second driver ~ Market Sentiment, is down to each Shareholder's personal perception and financial situation. When Pensana moved from Australia to London, the UK was on an emotional high, Brexit was driving an economic resurgence, British sentiment was positive, our SP reached an all-time high. Covid and a birthday party destroyed all that! Britain became rudderless and consequentially people have lost any appetite for financial risk, Sentiment collapsed along with our share price. Not so in the USA. One thing that the Americans do well, is to thrive under adversity. Once the US finally woke up to the prospect of being captive to China's monopolization of Rare Earths, they decided to fight back. War means $$$ can be made in the USA, Sentiment and the expectation of future profits are so strong there that the share prices of any company involved in the development of Rare Earths has go thru the roof! hence Pensana's NASDAQ listing. Lastly ~ Manipulation. It is now a given that China has been attacking the development of every RE Company on multiple fronts, Geo-politically in Greenland, Tanzania, South Africa and thru the Markets: GGG, PEK, ARU, MP, LYC, NTU; we would be mad to assume that they have left Pensana alone? Brokers are primarily interested earning commissions and could not care less where the money is coming from. While some Traders, may be trying to accumulate a position at the lowest carried cost possible, most are parasitically milking volatility to fill their pockets and do not consider the bigger picture. Five years ago, before it became apparent that global demand for RE's was going too far exceed any capacity to supply; there was a lot of negative speculation published on various forums by existing producers and competitors jockeying for position. Thankfully this trolling has now diminished although a few suborned soles remain. The last category 'Sharks' are ever present, and usually unseen until too late. The prime example is Shenghe's acquisition of Ngualla, and their ongoing battles for NTU and ARU. In each of these cases blatant SP manipulation is evident, for us Shibian-Stillwater, was a",

For me, Q2 is where the pieces of the jigsaw really start to fit together, One point that doesn\u2019t seem to get enough attention is the modular build approach for the plant, which should help reduce construction risk and support a smoother, faster ramp-up compared with traditional builds. On top of that, the recent US$100m strategic investment is a strong vote of confidence from serious backers (Hopefully soon to be revealed) and further underlines that Pensana is moving from concept into delivery.

His qualifications are in Media studies! having spent most of his time conducting \"opinion polls\" and reporting on local politics. To give him credit at least he is a journalist rather than a Librarian. But just like Chris he has no compunctions about mixing up his supposed 'facts' to match his storyline. In his very next article he states that there will be an Oz floor price of US$55,000/t  (half of Donald's), so how can he even contemplate his suggestion made about PRE just 2 weeks earlier that \"sustained pricing below $40-45 per kilogram for NdPr oxide.\"? While Indonisia is not in the same league as China, it does aspire to becoming a Rare Earth producer (Discovery Alert 25 Aug 2025). Their biggest problem in achieving those goals, is in Indonesia's atrocious ESG compliance and historical corruption record. If Mr Hidayat really wants to make a name for himself, perhaps he should apply his investigative journalistic talents to exposing what is actually happening in his own Country?",

          "content": "Novice - thanks for the question.  Yes, I am still trying to clarify what is going on with PRE's manifestly weird daily trading patterns, and why the SP has been way off-trend since November. First - have a look here: https://ibb.co/svjLKMrM Its a composite overlay chart of PRE SP since Jul 1 2025, + Nd Pr indicative pricing chart + the two RE indices (Wisdom Tree ETF and REMX) which have hitherto performed quite well as PRE SP trend indicators.   I've not made any attempt to reindex them all vertically - I just wanted to line up and see the shape and direction of the four charts across the same time base. By my (admittedly rough) estimates, PRE should be around \u00a31.39 (worst case) to \u00a31.48 (best case) at the moment, had the SP followed the others from the China-RE-sanctions panic peak in mid-October, then the post Trump/Xi reprieve deal at end Oct, leading to a general drop over the next 2 weeks to mid Nov, but then followed by sustained recovery all the way up to near the mid Oct peak (when Pensana was \u00a31.81) again. Whereas, Pensana continued its steady fall to the current low of 88.2p. Why?  What little real news in last Q 25 has been resaonably encouraging, if not even positive. My own views are that 3 factors are at work - geopolitics, Pensana Board's rapidly evolving strategy, and outright share price suppression. Too long to explain here, but I'd be interested to hear some feedback - particularly on the latter?",

Like PRE since Jun 2025 -  USB trading also has huge numbers of tiny trades of 1 or a few shares, among the expected size deals.  These are all type \"basket idx\".   Appears to be a way for large investors and balanced protfolio brokers to maintain their portfolio component ratios by combining all the buys and sells required to rebalance all their portfolio holdings in a single order, which triggers many small orders after being automatically executed as one. I don't think  offers any explanation for the Pensana small trades, unless somewhere there are investors with balanced  funds of RE stocks which operate as a single RE portfolio (Chima maybe??) .  PRE doesn't even appear in the REMX or Wisdom Tree component holdings as far as I know. I've just looked at the Dec 29 day's dealing for PRE, and there were 506 trades, of which 371 trades fall into the small number group.  Many of these are for just 1 share, but there was a string of 31 trades in 5 seconds just before the US NYSE open at 2:30pm - and every single one was for 454 shares.  When PRE opened at 8:00am, there were 120 O deals (not AT which is rather strange)  in the first 4 minutes all for less than 50 shares.  Definitely something fishy going on - possibly to do with keeping the PRE SP well down, so that the Q1 placement on the NASDAQ gets a good reception?",

If the 100 million strategic is in place and the EXIM arrangement comes off we will maintain 75% of ozango (maybe more if PLC pays 11 million USD drilling program and 30 million additional recovery circuit for Dy/Tb. but at the moment looking like 75% of phase 1 production, percentage of phase 2 isnt know yet, but FSDEA will continue to own 25% of the Longonjo resource.

          "content": "When a company applies to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the standard minimum bid price requirement is $4.00 per share. However, Nasdaq\u2019s rules provide an alternative based on the company\u2019s closing price \u2014 allowing companies to qualify with a $3.00 or $2.00 closing price instead of the $4 minimum bid price \u2014 if the company also meets additional, specific financial and listing criteria. Here\u2019s how the varying requirements work for the closing price alternatives: \ud83d\udcc9 1) $3.00 Closing Price Alternative A company may list with a minimum closing price of $3.00 per share (for at least 5 consecutive business days prior to Nasdaq approval) if it meets the Equity or Net Income listing standards. In addition to the closing price test, the company must satisfy the other required financial and liquidity criteria under those standards: Equity Standard Example Requirements Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $5 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $15 million Operating history: At least 2 years Net Income Standard Example Requirements Net income: At least $750,000 in the most recent fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $4 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $5 million Under either standard, the closing price of $3.00 must be maintained for at least five consecutive business days before Nasdaq will approve the listing under this alternative. \ud83d\udcc9 2) $2.00 Closing Price Alternative A company may list with a minimum closing price of $2.00 per share (also for at least 5 consecutive business days prior to approval) if it meets the Market Value of Listed Securities standard instead of the Equity or Net Income standards. This is generally viewed as a somewhat less demanding alternative in terms of profitability or operating history, but requires overall market value size. It also carries more stringent asset/value thresholds: Market Value of Listed Securities Standard Example Requirements Market value of listed securities: At least $50 million Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $4 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $15 million Again, the $2 closing price condition must be sustained for a minimum of five consecutive business days before Nasdaq will grant listing approval under this alternative.",

          "content": "Here\u2019s how the Nasdaq closing-price alternative checklist would apply to Pensana Rare Earths PLC (the London-listed company planning a U.S. listing, often reported as targeting Nasdaq in 2026) \u2014 based on the latest available financial and market data: \ud83d\udccc 1) Current Share Price & Market Context Pensana\u2019s London share price recently traded around ~84\u201388 pence (about \u00a30.84\u2013\u00a30.88), and a share consolidation is being proposed to align its share price with Nasdaq eligibility standards. Pensana is also trading OTC in the U.S. under tickers like PNSPF / PNSNF, with a U.S. market cap previously estimated around ~$480 m (data from late 2025). \ud83d\udc49 Implication: The share consolidation proposal strongly suggests management is aware that the company\u2019s pre-consolidation per-share price may be below Nasdaq\u2019s usual minimums \u2014 especially if they want to avoid needing a very low price exception \u2014 although consolidated price targets haven\u2019t been publicly confirmed. \ud83d\udcc9 2) $3.00 or $2.00 Closing Price Eligibility To qualify under Nasdaq\u2019s closing price alternatives instead of the standard $4.00 minimum bid price, Pensana would need to meet specific conditions: \ud83d\udd39 $3.00 Closing Price Alternative (To use a $3 closing price instead of $4) Checklist: \u2610 Closing share price \u2265 $3.00 for 5 consecutive business days \u2610 Qualify under either: Equity Standard (e.g., \u2265 $5 m equity + \u2265 $15 m public float; operating history) Net Income Standard (positive or qualifying profitability + equity & float) Pensana Status: Pensana is currently unprofitable (net losses) with no positive net income reported and no revenue as it remains in development. Stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet appears positive but modest relative to Nasdaq thresholds (equity around tens of millions of dollars), but detailed audited figures vs Nasdaq thresholds aren\u2019t public. Market value of unrestricted public float likely meets Nasdaq thresholds when aggregated across U.S. OTC + LSE ownership if consolidated shares lift per-share value. (Estimates vary depending on currency and exchange rates.) \ud83d\udc49 Result: Qualifying under the $3 closing price standard seems challenging because Pensana does not currently meet a Net Income Standard and the Equity Standard (while perhaps technically possible if equity and float are adequate) still requires the $3 share price before Nasdaq will approve the alternative. Management\u2019s share consolidation indicates ongoing work to meet that price threshold. \ud83d\udd39 $2.00 Closing Price Alternative (To use a $2 closing price instead of $4) Checklist: \u2610 Closing price \u2265 $2.00 for 5 consecutive business days \u2610 Qualify under Market Value of Listed Securities Standard: \u2265 $50 m market value of listed securities \u2265 $4 m stockholders\u2019 equity \u2265 $15 m unrestricted float value Pensana Status: Pensana\u2019s current LSE market cap is likely well over $50 m, and combined with an OTC valuation could satisfy the $50 m",

Equity is positive, though at development stage and dependent on audited statements; it appears above the minimum. Unrestricted float thresholds are plausibly met given wide institutional and public holdings if share consolidation increases per-share price. \ud83d\udc49 Result: The $2.00 closing price alternative is the most realistic Nasdaq path for Pensana \u2014 but only if: The post-consolidation share price stays \u2265 $2 for at least five consecutive business days, and The company satisfies the Market Value of Listed Securities Standard (which hinges on total float and audited equity figures).",

I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

My friendly AI chatbot assures me that: \"The average time for a mining company to receive assay results after finishing a drilling program is typically several weeks to several months, commonly ranging from 3 to 12 weeks\" So here we are almost exactly 12 weeks on - every reason to believe the results are already in the bag, back at Pensana HQ, wherever that might be. Any views on what Pensana might do about announcing them,  if the results are good or if they are bad, in view of the current (depressed and depressing) SP and the upcoming Nasdaq float? The other drilling survey (Longonjo reserve enhancement) announced mid-Nov 25 starts around now in early 2026, but Pensana isn't going to wait till all the those results come in, but plans to strategically 'drip-feed' results, released throughout 2026 as they become available, or more likely - when the time is right..",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

          "content": "For those wondering wtf China is on about: Pensana Major shareholder support for US strategy On 15 May 2025, the Company announced the terms and timing of the first US$25 million equity tranche, as part of the main Longonjo mine financing, for deployment at subsidiary level into Ozango Minerais SA. Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

However, Nasdaq\u2019s rules provide an alternative based on the company\u2019s closing price \u2014 allowing companies to qualify with a $3.00 or $2.00 closing price instead of the $4 minimum bid price \u2014 if the company also meets additional, specific financial and listing criteria. Here\u2019s how the varying requirements work for the closing price alternatives: \ud83d\udcc9 1) $3.00 Closing Price Alternative A company may list with a minimum closing price of $3.00 per share (for at least 5 consecutive business days prior to Nasdaq approval) if it meets the Equity or Net Income listing standards. In addition to the closing price test, the company must satisfy the other required financial and liquidity criteria under those standards: Equity Standard Example Requirements Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $5 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $15 million Operating history: At least 2 years Net Income Standard Example Requirements Net income: At least $750,000 in the most recent fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $4 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $5 million Under either standard, the closing price of $3.00 must be maintained for at least five consecutive business days before Nasdaq will approve the listing under this alternative. \ud83d\udcc9 2) $2.00 Closing Price Alternative A company may list with a minimum closing price of $2.00 per share (also for at least 5 consecutive business days prior to approval) if it meets the Market Value of Listed Securities standard instead of the Equity or Net Income standards. This is generally viewed as a somewhat less demanding alternative in terms of profitability or operating history, but requires overall market value size. It also carries more stringent asset/value thresholds: Market Value of Listed Securities Standard Example Requirements Market value of listed securities: At least $50 million Stockholders\u2019 equity: At least $4 million Market value of unrestricted publicly held shares: At least $15 million Again, the $2 closing price condition must be sustained for a minimum of five consecutive business days before Nasdaq will grant listing approval under this alternative.",

          "content": "Here\u2019s how the Nasdaq closing-price alternative checklist would apply to Pensana Rare Earths PLC (the London-listed company planning a U.S. listing, often reported as targeting Nasdaq in 2026) \u2014 based on the latest available financial and market data: \ud83d\udccc 1) Current Share Price & Market Context Pensana\u2019s London share price recently traded around ~84\u201388 pence (about \u00a30.84\u2013\u00a30.88), and a share consolidation is being proposed to align its share price with Nasdaq eligibility standards. Pensana is also trading OTC in the U.S. under tickers like PNSPF / PNSNF, with a U.S. market cap previously estimated around ~$480 m (data from late 2025). \ud83d\udc49 Implication: The share consolidation proposal strongly suggests management is aware that the company\u2019s pre-consolidation per-share price may be below Nasdaq\u2019s usual minimums \u2014 especially if they want to avoid needing a very low price exception \u2014 although consolidated price targets haven\u2019t been publicly confirmed. \ud83d\udcc9 2) $3.00 or $2.00 Closing Price Eligibility To qualify under Nasdaq\u2019s closing price alternatives instead of the standard $4.00 minimum bid price, Pensana would need to meet specific conditions: \ud83d\udd39 $3.00 Closing Price Alternative (To use a $3 closing price instead of $4) Checklist: \u2610 Closing share price \u2265 $3.00 for 5 consecutive business days \u2610 Qualify under either: Equity Standard (e.g., \u2265 $5 m equity + \u2265 $15 m public float; operating history) Net Income Standard (positive or qualifying profitability + equity & float) Pensana Status: Pensana is currently unprofitable (net losses) with no positive net income reported and no revenue as it remains in development. Stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet appears positive but modest relative to Nasdaq thresholds (equity around tens of millions of dollars), but detailed audited figures vs Nasdaq thresholds aren\u2019t public. Market value of unrestricted public float likely meets Nasdaq thresholds when aggregated across U.S. OTC + LSE ownership if consolidated shares lift per-share value. (Estimates vary depending on currency and exchange rates.) \ud83d\udc49 Result: Qualifying under the $3 closing price standard seems challenging because Pensana does not currently meet a Net Income Standard and the Equity Standard (while perhaps technically possible if equity and float are adequate) still requires the $3 share price before Nasdaq will approve the alternative. Management\u2019s share consolidation indicates ongoing work to meet that price threshold. \ud83d\udd39 $2.00 Closing Price Alternative (To use a $2 closing price instead of $4) Checklist: \u2610 Closing price \u2265 $2.00 for 5 consecutive business days \u2610 Qualify under Market Value of Listed Securities Standard: \u2265 $50 m market value of listed securities \u2265 $4 m stockholders\u2019 equity \u2265 $15 m unrestricted float value Pensana Status: Pensana\u2019s current LSE market cap is likely well over $50 m, and combined with an OTC valuation could satisfy the $50 m",

Equity is positive, though at development stage and dependent on audited statements; it appears above the minimum. Unrestricted float thresholds are plausibly met given wide institutional and public holdings if share consolidation increases per-share price. \ud83d\udc49 Result: The $2.00 closing price alternative is the most realistic Nasdaq path for Pensana \u2014 but only if: The post-consolidation share price stays \u2265 $2 for at least five consecutive business days, and The company satisfies the Market Value of Listed Securities Standard (which hinges on total float and audited equity figures).",

I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

My friendly AI chatbot assures me that: \"The average time for a mining company to receive assay results after finishing a drilling program is typically several weeks to several months, commonly ranging from 3 to 12 weeks\" So here we are almost exactly 12 weeks on - every reason to believe the results are already in the bag, back at Pensana HQ, wherever that might be. Any views on what Pensana might do about announcing them,  if the results are good or if they are bad, in view of the current (depressed and depressing) SP and the upcoming Nasdaq float? The other drilling survey (Longonjo reserve enhancement) announced mid-Nov 25 starts around now in early 2026, but Pensana isn't going to wait till all the those results come in, but plans to strategically 'drip-feed' results, released throughout 2026 as they become available, or more likely - when the time is right..",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

As with any serious investment, I did the work: attended meetings and AGMs, reviewed what was in the public domain, and formed my own view. It hasn\u2019t all been easy. Through that process I\u2019ve come to know the board and PA. I\u2019ve not come across a more compliant or straight group of people. Yes, I\u2019ve met PA personally, as any substantial shareholder does, but he is extremely guarded on what he can and cannot say and fully respects market-disclosure and insider-trading rules. Anyone suggesting otherwise doesn\u2019t understand how this works. The recent capital activity also makes sense if you think beyond the daily SP. They have one remaining committee step before EXIM board approval. Ahead of that, the company is strengthening the balance sheet: improving liquidity, converting debt to equity, and reinforcing financial resilience. This is exactly what ECAs look for. Add the proposed $100m equity participation (with formal documentation) and the picture is clear: this is about presenting a robust, investable structure, not managing short-term price action. On the resource side, the drilling is not about discovery. The company already understands the likely scale of Longonjo; this is about certifying it. Longonjo already works commercially \u2014 certification toward a billion-tonne-scale resource materially strengthens the project\u2019s strategic position. This is limited short-term shareholder pain ahead of potentially very significant shareholder gain. If you want to contribute, do the work. If not, get a life and stop polluting the board.",

In principle the primary market is for IPOs and the secondary market is where companies are  expected to raise further capital. The distinction is pretty obvious if you look at the Companies Act. One reason for the legislation is that issuing shares at a discount is a fairly simple way of cheating shareholders out of what are regarded as their rightful rewards.However, on occasion, raising capital from existing shareholders may be impractical or impossible so there is a provision in the Companies Act which permits shareholders to vote to disapply their pre-emption rights. Unfortunately this provision has become more and more frequently misused by company managements to issue discounted shares to favoured shareholders \u2013 something which is obviously to the disadvantage of the remaining shareholders. The whole business of discounted share issues that needs much tighter control, and the absence of that control does the reputation of the LSE no good at all. In the case of Pensana it is very unlikely that shareholders who voted to forego their pre-emption rights thought they were voting for M&G to be issued discounted shares. Indeed I am surprised that M&G thought it appropriate to accept the shares.",

AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

          "content": "Novice - yes I do rely on trading patterns.  Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

          "content": "Novice - I doubt very much if  \"making stuff up as they go along\" is going to keep Pensana's sponsors of the  Coola/Sulima West project happy. In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

This enables tiny fractional orders to be processed internally, efficiently and avoid commission fees.  However, it is not possible to place fractional orders on the LSE, so it also acts as an aggregator when it trades on the main bourse by combining multiple internal fractional orders into a single transaction for a given stock, hence spreading the dealing cost.   Essentially,  it holds a limited inventory of certain equities and re-stocks via intermittent market deals. I can see how that might account for a few small volume aggregate orders of a single stock in one day, but why would they (together with the limited numbers of  other no-fee dealers) want to incur the dealing costs for many hundreds of such deals in the case of Pensana? And why would they do this at set times of the day, each and every day?",

These 489 microtrades today accounted for 58% of all trades today, but a tiny 1.26% of the day's volume. As normal(?) - some 106 microtrades were placed at the start of the trading day from 08:03am to 08:06am, and the usual NYSE open burst of 42 microtrades between 14:30:53 and 14:34:25PM. Large trades today (greater than 7500 shares) accounted for only 51 deals or 6% of all deals, but a huge 69.2% of the day's volume, including 5 trades of type ? (unknown buy or sell) totalling 390,000 shares (all O trades) Certain nominee brokers report their deal prices to 2 or 3 decimal places (eg: 108.416), where the majority only report to 1 decimal place (eg: 109.4). All of the 2 and 3 digit priced trades were O trades, and not many were microtrades.  These trades are almost all stand-alone (not batched in groups) and look like \"real\" trades. This allows another level of information to be analysed by looking only at these 2 or 3 decimal place brokers deals only. Surpisingly, today there was atotal of 48 3-digit brokers' deals which accounted for 31.6% of all voume, and had substantially larger average deal size (over 12,000 shares) per deal, but SOLD 2.5 times the amount they bought.  They also listed two trades of type ?, totalling 250,000 shares. There were another 54 2-digit brokers' deals accounting for 14.5% of all volume, but they BOUGHT 3 times the volume they sold. So, in total, these specific brokers accounted for 46.2% of all of today's volume, and their deal size was on average 3.8 times the average deal today. If we assume a single nominee broker is behind all the 3 digit trades, and another single broker is behind all the 2-digit trades, then the former shed some 141,000 shares and the latter acquired 75,000 shares.  However, two of the 3-digit broker's deals today went through as 'Unknowns' ie: not known if a buy or sell, totalling 250,000 shares. Should be another interesting day tomorrow if the volume trend keeps going.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

          "content": "For those wondering wtf China is on about: Pensana Major shareholder support for US strategy On 15 May 2025, the Company announced the terms and timing of the first US$25 million equity tranche, as part of the main Longonjo mine financing, for deployment at subsidiary level into Ozango Minerais SA. Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

My friendly AI chatbot assures me that: \"The average time for a mining company to receive assay results after finishing a drilling program is typically several weeks to several months, commonly ranging from 3 to 12 weeks\" So here we are almost exactly 12 weeks on - every reason to believe the results are already in the bag, back at Pensana HQ, wherever that might be. Any views on what Pensana might do about announcing them,  if the results are good or if they are bad, in view of the current (depressed and depressing) SP and the upcoming Nasdaq float? The other drilling survey (Longonjo reserve enhancement) announced mid-Nov 25 starts around now in early 2026, but Pensana isn't going to wait till all the those results come in, but plans to strategically 'drip-feed' results, released throughout 2026 as they become available, or more likely - when the time is right..",

As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing?

AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

          "content": "Novice - yes I do rely on trading patterns.  Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

          "content": "Novice - I doubt very much if  \"making stuff up as they go along\" is going to keep Pensana's sponsors of the  Coola/Sulima West project happy. In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

Simply put, they don't want Chinese supply-chain fingerprints anywhere in their RE magnet-dependent manufacturing - whether that's in defence, energy, consumer - whatever. They can't enforce this unless a way is found to 'watermark' every stage in the magnet supply chain.    It's pointless sourcing your RE magnets say from a German magnet supplier, if their RE ores came from China directly, or via as many refining intermediaries as needed to hide the  evidence.  Hitherto - impossible.  No longer apparently. Re-Element now has end-to-end traceability (unhackable - based on block chain) giving military-grade verifiability of origin, which fully complies with U.S. Department of War's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements. So Re-Element now has a simple token system which gives it a unique edge  to streamline compliance workflows, enhance supply-chain transparency, and support secure trade finance for U.S. manufacturers and defense contractors. Which will also cover Pensana's entire Longonjo ReElement offtake under the June 2025 MoU..... So now, there is no need for floor pricing to keep China from undermining Western investment - just mandating a simple electronic token from your supplier will do the trick.  Good news or what?",

This enables tiny fractional orders to be processed internally, efficiently and avoid commission fees.  However, it is not possible to place fractional orders on the LSE, so it also acts as an aggregator when it trades on the main bourse by combining multiple internal fractional orders into a single transaction for a given stock, hence spreading the dealing cost.   Essentially,  it holds a limited inventory of certain equities and re-stocks via intermittent market deals. I can see how that might account for a few small volume aggregate orders of a single stock in one day, but why would they (together with the limited numbers of  other no-fee dealers) want to incur the dealing costs for many hundreds of such deals in the case of Pensana? And why would they do this at set times of the day, each and every day?",

These 489 microtrades today accounted for 58% of all trades today, but a tiny 1.26% of the day's volume. As normal(?) - some 106 microtrades were placed at the start of the trading day from 08:03am to 08:06am, and the usual NYSE open burst of 42 microtrades between 14:30:53 and 14:34:25PM. Large trades today (greater than 7500 shares) accounted for only 51 deals or 6% of all deals, but a huge 69.2% of the day's volume, including 5 trades of type ? (unknown buy or sell) totalling 390,000 shares (all O trades) Certain nominee brokers report their deal prices to 2 or 3 decimal places (eg: 108.416), where the majority only report to 1 decimal place (eg: 109.4). All of the 2 and 3 digit priced trades were O trades, and not many were microtrades.  These trades are almost all stand-alone (not batched in groups) and look like \"real\" trades. This allows another level of information to be analysed by looking only at these 2 or 3 decimal place brokers deals only. Surpisingly, today there was atotal of 48 3-digit brokers' deals which accounted for 31.6% of all voume, and had substantially larger average deal size (over 12,000 shares) per deal, but SOLD 2.5 times the amount they bought.  They also listed two trades of type ?, totalling 250,000 shares. There were another 54 2-digit brokers' deals accounting for 14.5% of all volume, but they BOUGHT 3 times the volume they sold. So, in total, these specific brokers accounted for 46.2% of all of today's volume, and their deal size was on average 3.8 times the average deal today. If we assume a single nominee broker is behind all the 3 digit trades, and another single broker is behind all the 2-digit trades, then the former shed some 141,000 shares and the latter acquired 75,000 shares.  However, two of the 3-digit broker's deals today went through as 'Unknowns' ie: not known if a buy or sell, totalling 250,000 shares. Should be another interesting day tomorrow if the volume trend keeps going.",

This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium.

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

Photo resolution is better than their news releases - zoom does show quite a lot of workers in many shots.  It's here: https://pensana.co.uk/longonjo-site-activities/ Certainly agree with you the SP resistance is a puzzle.   I'm coming to the view that PRE share trading isn't as liquid as it looks.  I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr - it seems the LSE has already jumped on the AI bandwagon for Market Surveillance. \"As of 2025 the London Stock Exchange has begun integrating AI through its AI-powered Surveillance Guide, which uses Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic\u2019s Claude models to automate news sensitivity analysis and support analysts in triaging potential market abuse, such as spoofing, across MiFID asset classes. AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

          "content": "Novice - yes I do rely on trading patterns.  Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

JORC Reserve capable of creating 139,000 Tonnes of NDPR Oxide, that\u2019s before Coola, Somali West or the targeted increase in Longonjo \u2022\tQuick Google \u201cwhat is the predicated NDPR Oxide demand over the next 10 year\u201d From multiple sources the answer is Massive!!!, and in my own opinion the world is transitions to electric plus I believe robots will be huge. \u2022\tQuick Google \u201cHow will Pensana ship product\u201d Lobito corridor? Wow that has had some investment. I obviously did a lot more research before investing what for me is serious investment, my issue with your posts is they are clearly motivated by a personal grievance with Pensana, which you have never justified. You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

Longonjo is the only NEW source of RE's that is currently in construction, which is capable of delivering BULK NdPr into the Western magnet market. The US has already invested heavily in Angola. Angola is one of the few countries that Donald has not upset in his pursuits, and its government is fully supportive of the plan.

I also think you are doing the right thing by selling your shares if you are so disappointed. The bottom line is if you understand what you hold and the share price goes down you still sleep well at night. I have a friend that bought a small number of shares off the back of my advice and he texts me every time the share price drops. In hindsight, I've realised he isn't really interested in the company, has no interest in learning about the business and he is incredibly risk averse. I regret telling him to buy. FWIW I'm sleeping like a baby at the moment. In terms of Nasdaq, there are many clues as to what is about to happen. One is Pensana have publicly announced they do not need to consolidate. To list on the Nasdaq requires a minimum share price of $4. I could be wrong but if I think what is about to happen, happens, the company will list on the Nasdaq at between \u00a33.50 and \u00a35. Maybe more. Timing? They've said they wish to list mid 2026 (a clue in itself as the company initially said they wanted to list in Q1 2026). p.s. Mothballing Saltend in favour of a 'US mine to magnet strategy' was entirely the right decision and is the reason why this company will become so valuable.",

However, this is not the only mining stock that has gone down this week. many of my gold stocks have walked the same path regardless of the record breaking prices of gold. Is it the weather, the time of year, or is it the fear of war and the huge drop in the prices of Bitcoin etc? The world appears to be very unsettled, and all the governments piling into gold doesn't bode well. Perhaps solid gold is the real place we should go rather than lithium. I for one, am planning to reduce my 4 fifths holding in Pensana and buying a more diverse spread. They have been so disappointing since the massive drop back from 184p.",

Simply put, they don't want Chinese supply-chain fingerprints anywhere in their RE magnet-dependent manufacturing - whether that's in defence, energy, consumer - whatever. They can't enforce this unless a way is found to 'watermark' every stage in the magnet supply chain.    It's pointless sourcing your RE magnets say from a German magnet supplier, if their RE ores came from China directly, or via as many refining intermediaries as needed to hide the  evidence.  Hitherto - impossible.  No longer apparently. Re-Element now has end-to-end traceability (unhackable - based on block chain) giving military-grade verifiability of origin, which fully complies with U.S. Department of War's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements. So Re-Element now has a simple token system which gives it a unique edge  to streamline compliance workflows, enhance supply-chain transparency, and support secure trade finance for U.S. manufacturers and defense contractors. Which will also cover Pensana's entire Longonjo ReElement offtake under the June 2025 MoU..... So now, there is no need for floor pricing to keep China from undermining Western investment - just mandating a simple electronic token from your supplier will do the trick.  Good news or what?",

This enables tiny fractional orders to be processed internally, efficiently and avoid commission fees.  However, it is not possible to place fractional orders on the LSE, so it also acts as an aggregator when it trades on the main bourse by combining multiple internal fractional orders into a single transaction for a given stock, hence spreading the dealing cost.   Essentially,  it holds a limited inventory of certain equities and re-stocks via intermittent market deals. I can see how that might account for a few small volume aggregate orders of a single stock in one day, but why would they (together with the limited numbers of  other no-fee dealers) want to incur the dealing costs for many hundreds of such deals in the case of Pensana? And why would they do this at set times of the day, each and every day?",

          "content": "PRE Trading summary 26 Jan SP up 7.5% on the day with largest total volume traded (1.84m) since Nov 27th 2025  -  2.4 X previous day's volume. 850 deals today - 508 buys, 327 sells and 15 unknown ? trades (those totalled 400,533 shares) AT deals were positive Buy/Sell ratio 1.4: 1, where O deals were negative at 0.67:1 Of the 850 deals, 489 were for microtrades (less than 240 shares) - the vast majority of which were O deals (397) with only 92 AT microtrades. These 489 microtrades today accounted for 58% of all trades today, but a tiny 1.26% of the day's volume. As normal(?) - some 106 microtrades were placed at the start of the trading day from 08:03am to 08:06am, and the usual NYSE open burst of 42 microtrades between 14:30:53 and 14:34:25PM. Large trades today (greater than 7500 shares) accounted for only 51 deals or 6% of all deals, but a huge 69.2% of the day's volume, including 5 trades of type ? (unknown buy or sell) totalling 390,000 shares (all O trades) Certain nominee brokers report their deal prices to 2 or 3 decimal places (eg: 108.416), where the majority only report to 1 decimal place (eg: 109.4). All of the 2 and 3 digit priced trades were O trades, and not many were microtrades.  These trades are almost all stand-alone (not batched in groups) and look like \"real\" trades. This allows another level of information to be analysed by looking only at these 2 or 3 decimal place brokers deals only. Surpisingly, today there was atotal of 48 3-digit brokers' deals which accounted for 31.6% of all voume, and had substantially larger average deal size (over 12,000 shares) per deal, but SOLD 2.5 times the amount they bought.  They also listed two trades of type ?, totalling 250,000 shares. There were another 54 2-digit brokers' deals accounting for 14.5% of all volume, but they BOUGHT 3 times the volume they sold. So, in total, these specific brokers accounted for 46.2% of all of today's volume, and their deal size was on average 3.8 times the average deal today. If we assume a single nominee broker is behind all the 3 digit trades, and another single broker is behind all the 2-digit trades, then the former shed some 141,000 shares and the latter acquired 75,000 shares.  However, two of the 3-digit broker's deals today went through as 'Unknowns' ie: not known if a buy or sell, totalling 250,000 shares. Should be another interesting day tomorrow if the volume trend keeps going.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

We will announce the findings in the coming weeks,\" said Grant Hayward, Exploration Manager at Pensana. My friendly AI chatbot assures me that: \"The average time for a mining company to receive assay results after finishing a drilling program is typically several weeks to several months, commonly ranging from 3 to 12 weeks\" So here we are almost exactly 12 weeks on - every reason to believe the results are already in the bag, back at Pensana HQ, wherever that might be. Any views on what Pensana might do about announcing them,  if the results are good or if they are bad, in view of the current (depressed and depressing) SP and the upcoming Nasdaq float? The other drilling survey (Longonjo reserve enhancement) announced mid-Nov 25 starts around now in early 2026, but Pensana isn't going to wait till all the those results come in, but plans to strategically 'drip-feed' results, released throughout 2026 as they become available, or more likely - when the time is right..",

I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

I obviously did a lot more research before investing what for me is serious investment, my issue with your posts is they are clearly motivated by a personal grievance with Pensana, which you have never justified. You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

However, now that the plans for Saltend have been shelved. You no longer have any emotional ties, so why persist? especially in these highly volatile times. As to EXIM, it would be ludicrous for the US to now abandon all of the time and effort that they have invested in securing a stake in what is shaping up to be the only short-term answer to their predicament ie the rapidly approaching shutdown of Western manufacturing industries when China finally pulls the plug on its rare earth exports. Longonjo is the only NEW source of RE's that is currently in construction, which is capable of delivering BULK NdPr into the Western magnet market. The US has already invested heavily in Angola. Angola is one of the few countries that Donald has not upset in his pursuits, and its government is fully supportive of the plan. For EXIM to walk away at this late stage would be totally nonsensical!",

I also think you are doing the right thing by selling your shares if you are so disappointed. The bottom line is if you understand what you hold and the share price goes down you still sleep well at night. I have a friend that bought a small number of shares off the back of my advice and he texts me every time the share price drops. In hindsight, I've realised he isn't really interested in the company, has no interest in learning about the business and he is incredibly risk averse. I regret telling him to buy. FWIW I'm sleeping like a baby at the moment. In terms of Nasdaq, there are many clues as to what is about to happen. One is Pensana have publicly announced they do not need to consolidate. To list on the Nasdaq requires a minimum share price of $4. I could be wrong but if I think what is about to happen, happens, the company will list on the Nasdaq at between \u00a33.50 and \u00a35. Maybe more. Timing? They've said they wish to list mid 2026 (a clue in itself as the company initially said they wanted to list in Q1 2026). p.s. Mothballing Saltend in favour of a 'US mine to magnet strategy' was entirely the right decision and is the reason why this company will become so valuable.",

I get asked several times a week if it is a safe time to pile back in, but in honesty I tell them that I don't know.

Is it the weather, the time of year, or is it the fear of war and the huge drop in the prices of Bitcoin etc? The world appears to be very unsettled, and all the governments piling into gold doesn't bode well. Perhaps solid gold is the real place we should go rather than lithium.

Simply put, they don't want Chinese supply-chain fingerprints anywhere in their RE magnet-dependent manufacturing - whether that's in defence, energy, consumer - whatever. They can't enforce this unless a way is found to 'watermark' every stage in the magnet supply chain.    It's pointless sourcing your RE magnets say from a German magnet supplier, if their RE ores came from China directly, or via as many refining intermediaries as needed to hide the  evidence.  Hitherto - impossible.  No longer apparently. Re-Element now has end-to-end traceability (unhackable - based on block chain) giving military-grade verifiability of origin, which fully complies with U.S. Department of War's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements. So Re-Element now has a simple token system which gives it a unique edge  to streamline compliance workflows, enhance supply-chain transparency, and support secure trade finance for U.S. manufacturers and defense contractors. Which will also cover Pensana's entire Longonjo ReElement offtake under the June 2025 MoU..... So now, there is no need for floor pricing to keep China from undermining Western investment - just mandating a simple electronic token from your supplier will do the trick.  Good news or what?",

This enables tiny fractional orders to be processed internally, efficiently and avoid commission fees.  However, it is not possible to place fractional orders on the LSE, so it also acts as an aggregator when it trades on the main bourse by combining multiple internal fractional orders into a single transaction for a given stock, hence spreading the dealing cost.   Essentially,  it holds a limited inventory of certain equities and re-stocks via intermittent market deals. I can see how that might account for a few small volume aggregate orders of a single stock in one day, but why would they (together with the limited numbers of  other no-fee dealers) want to incur the dealing costs for many hundreds of such deals in the case of Pensana? And why would they do this at set times of the day, each and every day?",

          "content": "PRE Trading summary 26 Jan SP up 7.5% on the day with largest total volume traded (1.84m) since Nov 27th 2025  -  2.4 X previous day's volume. 850 deals today - 508 buys, 327 sells and 15 unknown ? trades (those totalled 400,533 shares) AT deals were positive Buy/Sell ratio 1.4: 1, where O deals were negative at 0.67:1 Of the 850 deals, 489 were for microtrades (less than 240 shares) - the vast majority of which were O deals (397) with only 92 AT microtrades. These 489 microtrades today accounted for 58% of all trades today, but a tiny 1.26% of the day's volume. As normal(?) - some 106 microtrades were placed at the start of the trading day from 08:03am to 08:06am, and the usual NYSE open burst of 42 microtrades between 14:30:53 and 14:34:25PM. Large trades today (greater than 7500 shares) accounted for only 51 deals or 6% of all deals, but a huge 69.2% of the day's volume, including 5 trades of type ? (unknown buy or sell) totalling 390,000 shares (all O trades) Certain nominee brokers report their deal prices to 2 or 3 decimal places (eg: 108.416), where the majority only report to 1 decimal place (eg: 109.4). All of the 2 and 3 digit priced trades were O trades, and not many were microtrades.  These trades are almost all stand-alone (not batched in groups) and look like \"real\" trades. This allows another level of information to be analysed by looking only at these 2 or 3 decimal place brokers deals only. Surpisingly, today there was atotal of 48 3-digit brokers' deals which accounted for 31.6% of all voume, and had substantially larger average deal size (over 12,000 shares) per deal, but SOLD 2.5 times the amount they bought.  They also listed two trades of type ?, totalling 250,000 shares. There were another 54 2-digit brokers' deals accounting for 14.5% of all volume, but they BOUGHT 3 times the volume they sold. So, in total, these specific brokers accounted for 46.2% of all of today's volume, and their deal size was on average 3.8 times the average deal today. If we assume a single nominee broker is behind all the 3 digit trades, and another single broker is behind all the 2-digit trades, then the former shed some 141,000 shares and the latter acquired 75,000 shares.  However, two of the 3-digit broker's deals today went through as 'Unknowns' ie: not known if a buy or sell, totalling 250,000 shares. Should be another interesting day tomorrow if the volume trend keeps going.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

          "content": "For those wondering wtf China is on about: Pensana Major shareholder support for US strategy On 15 May 2025, the Company announced the terms and timing of the first US$25 million equity tranche, as part of the main Longonjo mine financing, for deployment at subsidiary level into Ozango Minerais SA. Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

It's here: https://pensana.co.uk/longonjo-site-activities/ Certainly agree with you the SP resistance is a puzzle.   I'm coming to the view that PRE share trading isn't as liquid as it looks.  I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

          "content": "Novice - yes I do rely on trading patterns.  Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

The text it is mostly corporate speak with zero verifiable information. The domain was registered 15/12/2025, via a Lithuanian company called Hostinger Operations. I got this information with GoDaddy. The domain may have been purchased before the registration date, so Dec 15th may not be the date on which website was created/purchased (see below). I can find activity in SEC filings ( https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886346/000088634617000100/kaiform10q2q2017exhibit21.htm). It seems to connected to a US paper marker called Kadant Inc. There is also a 2021 US Dept. of Energy report related to lithium in which they are mentioned ( https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-SA-166046.pdf). According to this site: https://b2bhint.com/en/company/us-wa/cascade-natural-resources-llc--600622450 , the company was dissolved in 2021. So clearly the new owners picked up the defunct domain at point. I must assume that the investor(s) wish to remain anonymous, which is interesting...

As to EXIM, it would be ludicrous for the US to now abandon all of the time and effort that they have invested in securing a stake in what is shaping up to be the only short-term answer to their predicament ie the rapidly approaching shutdown of Western manufacturing industries when China finally pulls the plug on its rare earth exports. Longonjo is the only NEW source of RE's that is currently in construction, which is capable of delivering BULK NdPr into the Western magnet market. The US has already invested heavily in Angola. Angola is one of the few countries that Donald has not upset in his pursuits, and its government is fully supportive of the plan. For EXIM to walk away at this late stage would be totally nonsensical!",

I also think you are doing the right thing by selling your shares if you are so disappointed. The bottom line is if you understand what you hold and the share price goes down you still sleep well at night. I have a friend that bought a small number of shares off the back of my advice and he texts me every time the share price drops. In hindsight, I've realised he isn't really interested in the company, has no interest in learning about the business and he is incredibly risk averse. I regret telling him to buy. FWIW I'm sleeping like a baby at the moment. In terms of Nasdaq, there are many clues as to what is about to happen. One is Pensana have publicly announced they do not need to consolidate. To list on the Nasdaq requires a minimum share price of $4. I could be wrong but if I think what is about to happen, happens, the company will list on the Nasdaq at between \u00a33.50 and \u00a35. Maybe more. Timing? They've said they wish to list mid 2026 (a clue in itself as the company initially said they wanted to list in Q1 2026). p.s. Mothballing Saltend in favour of a 'US mine to magnet strategy' was entirely the right decision and is the reason why this company will become so valuable.",

I get asked several times a week if it is a safe time to pile back in, but in honesty I tell them that I don't know.

Is it the weather, the time of year, or is it the fear of war and the huge drop in the prices of Bitcoin etc? The world appears to be very unsettled, and all the governments piling into gold doesn't bode well. Perhaps solid gold is the real place we should go rather than lithium.

Simply put, they don't want Chinese supply-chain fingerprints anywhere in their RE magnet-dependent manufacturing - whether that's in defence, energy, consumer - whatever. They can't enforce this unless a way is found to 'watermark' every stage in the magnet supply chain.    It's pointless sourcing your RE magnets say from a German magnet supplier, if their RE ores came from China directly, or via as many refining intermediaries as needed to hide the  evidence.  Hitherto - impossible.  No longer apparently. Re-Element now has end-to-end traceability (unhackable - based on block chain) giving military-grade verifiability of origin, which fully complies with U.S. Department of War's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements. So Re-Element now has a simple token system which gives it a unique edge  to streamline compliance workflows, enhance supply-chain transparency, and support secure trade finance for U.S. manufacturers and defense contractors. Which will also cover Pensana's entire Longonjo ReElement offtake under the June 2025 MoU..... So now, there is no need for floor pricing to keep China from undermining Western investment - just mandating a simple electronic token from your supplier will do the trick.  Good news or what?",

This enables tiny fractional orders to be processed internally, efficiently and avoid commission fees.  However, it is not possible to place fractional orders on the LSE, so it also acts as an aggregator when it trades on the main bourse by combining multiple internal fractional orders into a single transaction for a given stock, hence spreading the dealing cost.   Essentially,  it holds a limited inventory of certain equities and re-stocks via intermittent market deals. I can see how that might account for a few small volume aggregate orders of a single stock in one day, but why would they (together with the limited numbers of  other no-fee dealers) want to incur the dealing costs for many hundreds of such deals in the case of Pensana? And why would they do this at set times of the day, each and every day?",

These 489 microtrades today accounted for 58% of all trades today, but a tiny 1.26% of the day's volume. As normal(?) - some 106 microtrades were placed at the start of the trading day from 08:03am to 08:06am, and the usual NYSE open burst of 42 microtrades between 14:30:53 and 14:34:25PM. Large trades today (greater than 7500 shares) accounted for only 51 deals or 6% of all deals, but a huge 69.2% of the day's volume, including 5 trades of type ? (unknown buy or sell) totalling 390,000 shares (all O trades) Certain nominee brokers report their deal prices to 2 or 3 decimal places (eg: 108.416), where the majority only report to 1 decimal place (eg: 109.4). All of the 2 and 3 digit priced trades were O trades, and not many were microtrades.  These trades are almost all stand-alone (not batched in groups) and look like \"real\" trades. This allows another level of information to be analysed by looking only at these 2 or 3 decimal place brokers deals only. Surpisingly, today there was atotal of 48 3-digit brokers' deals which accounted for 31.6% of all voume, and had substantially larger average deal size (over 12,000 shares) per deal, but SOLD 2.5 times the amount they bought.  They also listed two trades of type ?, totalling 250,000 shares. There were another 54 2-digit brokers' deals accounting for 14.5% of all volume, but they BOUGHT 3 times the volume they sold. So, in total, these specific brokers accounted for 46.2% of all of today's volume, and their deal size was on average 3.8 times the average deal today. If we assume a single nominee broker is behind all the 3 digit trades, and another single broker is behind all the 2-digit trades, then the former shed some 141,000 shares and the latter acquired 75,000 shares.  However, two of the 3-digit broker's deals today went through as 'Unknowns' ie: not known if a buy or sell, totalling 250,000 shares. Should be another interesting day tomorrow if the volume trend keeps going.",

This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium.

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

It's here: https://pensana.co.uk/longonjo-site-activities/ Certainly agree with you the SP resistance is a puzzle.   I'm coming to the view that PRE share trading isn't as liquid as it looks.  I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

          "content": "Novice - yes I do rely on trading patterns.  Two sites are really useful: MarketScreener - here: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PENSANA-PLC-109347695/ and ADVFN here: https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/london/pensana-PRE/trades Both are free to register and use - nominally for 15 min delayed trades - but see further down. Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance? You cannot believe your posts help newbies like myself and you are clearly not invested so why keep up this campaign of hated I would love to know?",

In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",

In response to China comment, i think it is very unlikely EXIM is a guarantee instrument, so debt is part of the structure. At ~$65/kg NdPr, Phase 1 was already modelling around 150% debt service coverage. Current indicated pricing is roughly double that level, so free cash flow should comfortably service debt. With Phase 1 cash flow potentially starting in early 2027 and full build-out by 2029, a 60/40 structure could support around ~$500m total capex over time, covering Phase 1, Phase 2, Dy/Tb recovery, drilling, and potentially a major \u2014 if not full \u2014 equity position in downstream separation to extract full oxide value. At \u00a37 on 480m shares, the market cap would be under \u00a33.5bn (<$5bn) for 4,500t NdPr plus ~$50m per year from Dy/Tb.

Running an AI check on the https://cascadenaturalresources.com/ URL itself comes up with a few interesting points - always bearing in mind the possibility of AI fantasies!    Here's a summary: Cascade Natural Resources Limited is almost certainly: a newly formed vehicle, privately held, structured offshore (BVI/Mauritius/UAE most likely ) and created specifically for a single deal or negotiation,  with no prior operational history, with no connection to U.S. government rare\u2011earth programs and with no link to Cascade Investment (Bill Gates). The website: https://cascadenaturalresources.com/ is characteristic of a newly formed special\u2011purpose vehicle (SPV) rather than an established natural\u2011resources investor and the website was created to provide a public\u2011facing identity for a vehicle that did not previously exist. The domain cascadenaturalresources.com shows the classic fingerprints of a newly created SPV:  recently registered (the domain age is extremely young), privacy\u2011shielded WHOIS (registrant hidden behind a proxy), no historical DNS records,  single\u2011purpose hosting with no other sites on the same server,  no backlinks from industry, media, or institutional sites This combination is typical of a company created to front a specific transaction rather than a long\u2011standing operating business. Likely jurisdictional origin: domain privacy shielding is typical of BVI, Mauritius, and UAE\u2011based entities whose owners prefer opacity,  generic, compliance\u2011free website structure is characteristic of companies incorporated in jurisdictions where public disclosure is minimal, absence of any corporate identifiers (company number, registered office, directors) is unusual for UK, EU, or Australian companies, but normal for BVI, Cayman, Mauritius, and UAE free zones. \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfa Mauritius is a good match for Jurisdiction: popular for Africa\u2011facing mining and energy investments, often used for Angola\u2011related structures, entities frequently present with generic websites and no public filings, favoured for tax treaties and investment\u2011protection agreements. Mauritius jurisdiction fits the metadata and the presentation style, far better than the UK, US, Canada, Australia, or EU. This is consistent with Pensana\u2019s pattern of naming opaque or newly created entities as \u201cstrategic investors\u201d. It's probably nothing,  but the decent uptick in the SP today may well be a foretaste of things to come.",

The text it is mostly corporate speak with zero verifiable information. The domain was registered 15/12/2025, via a Lithuanian company called Hostinger Operations. I got this information with GoDaddy. The domain may have been purchased before the registration date, so Dec 15th may not be the date on which website was created/purchased (see below). I can find activity in SEC filings ( https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886346/000088634617000100/kaiform10q2q2017exhibit21.htm). It seems to connected to a US paper marker called Kadant Inc. There is also a 2021 US Dept. of Energy report related to lithium in which they are mentioned ( https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-SA-166046.pdf). According to this site: https://b2bhint.com/en/company/us-wa/cascade-natural-resources-llc--600622450 , the company was dissolved in 2021. So clearly the new owners picked up the defunct domain at point. I must assume that the investor(s) wish to remain anonymous, which is interesting... Yes I do hold stock and no I am not a deramper, but I will admit to being massively confused about how the company handles financial disclosures.",

Oddly, Co-pilot makes the statement: 'Given Pensana\u2019s history of announcing funding partners that later prove opaque or non\u2011existent, it\u2019s worth verifying the underlying entity'.   Putting that one aside.....    , it suggests that Cascade Resources Ltd could be a newly repurposed or renamed vehicle (common in private capital deals), or a special\u2011purpose investment entity using an existing shell. I went on to ask for a deep trace for the words 'Cascade' or 'Cascade Resources' in any of the US Govt departments providing capital investment for RE supply chains - drew a blank. No idea what's going on.  Most likely suggestion is that it's a new special-purpose vehicle which is not yet visible in public listings.  Very mysterious.",

Longonjo is the only NEW source of RE's that is currently in construction, which is capable of delivering BULK NdPr into the Western magnet market. The US has already invested heavily in Angola. Angola is one of the few countries that Donald has not upset in his pursuits, and its government is fully supportive of the plan.

I also think you are doing the right thing by selling your shares if you are so disappointed. The bottom line is if you understand what you hold and the share price goes down you still sleep well at night. I have a friend that bought a small number of shares off the back of my advice and he texts me every time the share price drops. In hindsight, I've realised he isn't really interested in the company, has no interest in learning about the business and he is incredibly risk averse. I regret telling him to buy. FWIW I'm sleeping like a baby at the moment. In terms of Nasdaq, there are many clues as to what is about to happen. One is Pensana have publicly announced they do not need to consolidate. To list on the Nasdaq requires a minimum share price of $4. I could be wrong but if I think what is about to happen, happens, the company will list on the Nasdaq at between \u00a33.50 and \u00a35. Maybe more. Timing? They've said they wish to list mid 2026 (a clue in itself as the company initially said they wanted to list in Q1 2026). p.s. Mothballing Saltend in favour of a 'US mine to magnet strategy' was entirely the right decision and is the reason why this company will become so valuable.",

I get asked several times a week if it is a safe time to pile back in, but in honesty I tell them that I don't know. I personally had to carry out MANY sales and rebuys to reduce my average share price, but still have been burned a bit this last week. Therefore, I sincerely hope you are correct.",

Is it the weather, the time of year, or is it the fear of war and the huge drop in the prices of Bitcoin etc? The world appears to be very unsettled, and all the governments piling into gold doesn't bode well. Perhaps solid gold is the real place we should go rather than lithium.

Simply put, they don't want Chinese supply-chain fingerprints anywhere in their RE magnet-dependent manufacturing - whether that's in defence, energy, consumer - whatever. They can't enforce this unless a way is found to 'watermark' every stage in the magnet supply chain.    It's pointless sourcing your RE magnets say from a German magnet supplier, if their RE ores came from China directly, or via as many refining intermediaries as needed to hide the  evidence.  Hitherto - impossible.  No longer apparently. Re-Element now has end-to-end traceability (unhackable - based on block chain) giving military-grade verifiability of origin, which fully complies with U.S. Department of War's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements. So Re-Element now has a simple token system which gives it a unique edge  to streamline compliance workflows, enhance supply-chain transparency, and support secure trade finance for U.S. manufacturers and defense contractors. Which will also cover Pensana's entire Longonjo ReElement offtake under the June 2025 MoU..... So now, there is no need for floor pricing to keep China from undermining Western investment - just mandating a simple electronic token from your supplier will do the trick.  Good news or what?",

This enables tiny fractional orders to be processed internally, efficiently and avoid commission fees.  However, it is not possible to place fractional orders on the LSE, so it also acts as an aggregator when it trades on the main bourse by combining multiple internal fractional orders into a single transaction for a given stock, hence spreading the dealing cost.   Essentially,  it holds a limited inventory of certain equities and re-stocks via intermittent market deals. I can see how that might account for a few small volume aggregate orders of a single stock in one day, but why would they (together with the limited numbers of  other no-fee dealers) want to incur the dealing costs for many hundreds of such deals in the case of Pensana? And why would they do this at set times of the day, each and every day?",

          "content": "PRE Trading summary 26 Jan SP up 7.5% on the day with largest total volume traded (1.84m) since Nov 27th 2025  -  2.4 X previous day's volume. 850 deals today - 508 buys, 327 sells and 15 unknown ? trades (those totalled 400,533 shares) AT deals were positive Buy/Sell ratio 1.4: 1, where O deals were negative at 0.67:1 Of the 850 deals, 489 were for microtrades (less than 240 shares) - the vast majority of which were O deals (397) with only 92 AT microtrades. These 489 microtrades today accounted for 58% of all trades today, but a tiny 1.26% of the day's volume. As normal(?) - some 106 microtrades were placed at the start of the trading day from 08:03am to 08:06am, and the usual NYSE open burst of 42 microtrades between 14:30:53 and 14:34:25PM. Large trades today (greater than 7500 shares) accounted for only 51 deals or 6% of all deals, but a huge 69.2% of the day's volume, including 5 trades of type ? (unknown buy or sell) totalling 390,000 shares (all O trades) Certain nominee brokers report their deal prices to 2 or 3 decimal places (eg: 108.416), where the majority only report to 1 decimal place (eg: 109.4). All of the 2 and 3 digit priced trades were O trades, and not many were microtrades.  These trades are almost all stand-alone (not batched in groups) and look like \"real\" trades. This allows another level of information to be analysed by looking only at these 2 or 3 decimal place brokers deals only. Surpisingly, today there was atotal of 48 3-digit brokers' deals which accounted for 31.6% of all voume, and had substantially larger average deal size (over 12,000 shares) per deal, but SOLD 2.5 times the amount they bought.  They also listed two trades of type ?, totalling 250,000 shares. There were another 54 2-digit brokers' deals accounting for 14.5% of all volume, but they BOUGHT 3 times the volume they sold. So, in total, these specific brokers accounted for 46.2% of all of today's volume, and their deal size was on average 3.8 times the average deal today. If we assume a single nominee broker is behind all the 3 digit trades, and another single broker is behind all the 2-digit trades, then the former shed some 141,000 shares and the latter acquired 75,000 shares.  However, two of the 3-digit broker's deals today went through as 'Unknowns' ie: not known if a buy or sell, totalling 250,000 shares. Should be another interesting day tomorrow if the volume trend keeps going.",

Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Environmental Impact Study) The ESIA Addendum for the Longonjo project includes radiation safety and waste management regulations that the project must follow under Angolan law \u2014 including radioactive materials and how they are to be handled and protected against environmental and health risks. This is part of the overall environmental permitting and regulatory framework. It references the Angolan radiation safety regulation and duties regarding handling sources, storage, transport, etc. The ESIA itself is a regulatory document that outlines waste management obligations, including for materials subject to specific controls such as radioactive waste. \ufffd Pensana PLC \ud83d\udccc Document Link: Longonjo ESIA Addendum (Full Report) maintained on Pensana\u2019s website: \ud83d\udd17 https://pensana.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESIA-Full-Report-EN-FINALmaio_2-2022-Full-Report-Certified.pdf \ufffd Pensana PLC You will find the waste/radiation sections in the regulatory and environmental management chapters (e.g., sections about radiation safety and waste management obligations). ### \ud83d\udccc 2. Technical Reports & Competent Person Statements Independent technical reports and resource statements related to Longonjo also address how radioactive components (NORM) are managed: Natural Radioactive Materials (NORM) in the ore are recognised in the technical documentation. Pensana states that its processing route extracts rare earths and sequesters the NORM-bearing waste into a tailings containment facility built to international standards. A Radiation Protection Plan based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance is referenced as the framework for managing worker, community, and environmental exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides. \ufffd Pensana PLC Example from technical reporting: Pensana will implement a Radiation Protection Plan oriented around IAEA RS-G-1.6 standards and conduct monitoring/audit of radiation risks. The documentation also states the NORM waste will be stored in engineered tailings facilities designed according to international mine waste standards. \ufffd Pensana PLC ### \ud83d\udccc 3. Public Statements on Waste Handling in Press Material In broader ESG commentary and investor releases, Pensana describes handling of NORM at Longonjo by: Separating radioactive elements out on site rather than exporting them embedded in concentrate. Storing the NORM-bearing waste securely in a permanent tailings storage facility designed to minimize environmental risk. \ufffd Investegate This is pitched as part of Pensana\u2019s environmental design approach. \ud83e\udde0 Important Points to Understand \u2705 \u201cRadioactive waste\u201d in this context usually refers to NORM: Rare-earth ores like monazite often contain traces of thorium and uranium. When the ore is processed, these naturally occurring radionuclides become concentrated in waste streams \u2014 and must be managed safely. \u2705 Pensana does have published plans for ha",

Additionally, FSDEA agreed the terms for the conversion into Pensana equity of the US$15 million bridging loan, previously advanced over the past 18 months to facilitate early-stage construction at Longonjo. The Company is now pleased to announce that FSDEA has agreed to a staged conversion of the US$15 million bridging loan to manage its ownership percentage in Pensana and to support the inclusion of new institutional investors at the time of the proposed Nasdaq listing mid-2026. M&G, the Company\u2019s second largest shareholder, has also recently expressed ongoing support for the Company\u2019s plans to develop a U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain, the investment of US$100 million from a strategic investor and the proposed NASDAQ listing by agreeing to invest a further \u00a35 million in the Company as announced on 16 December 2025. Given the 95 mio shares should be issued to the mystery investor, it would be the largest shareholder. Obviously the Angolan sovereign wealth fund wants to remain Pensana\u2019s largest shareholder, so something needed to be done, preferably something cheap. The U.S. focused mine to magnet supply chain is a total conceptional fail: Pensana, like everyone else, base their feasibility assumption on NdPr oxide. The US have more than enough NdPr from MP Materials. If there should be a shortfall, Lynas would cover that from: Announced capacity increases Reduced NdPr oxide sales to China for reduced China dependence and higher unit prices in the US eVAC, USA, has a flying start and will cover the most urgent REPM demand in the US. Indirectly CIA-financed Noveon are expected to evolve further. This covers the most pressing demand. Everything in else in NdFeB can and will come from China. The overall REPM planned capacities in the US anyway far exceed potential domestic demand. On top of that the policy of the current US administration is bound to stunt REPM demand growth in the US. Last but not least it is counter-intuitive to focus on the US, as long as the EU is world\u2019s single largest REPM market after China by far. The one benefit of focussing on USA over the EU is that Pensana will not be questioned on their ESG \u201cstrategy\u201d (it is not a policy!) when turning out comparatively massive quantities of radioactive waste in Angola for which it has not bothered for years to publish a tangible permanent disposal solution. And that with an Angolan state participation whose government actually should be interested in a solution to the problem. At NASDAQ Pensana hope to find fools who are not yet tired of the boastful announcements of its chairman.",

You are fabricating a non-issue out of a lie, in most jurisdictions even in Singapore, that's called slander. For somebody who professes to be knowledgeable about the Rare Earth mining Industry. Your repeated, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims about Radionuclides, clearly demonstrates that you are either totally ignorant on the subject, making it up, or that you are unable to understand even basic mathematics. There again what could we expect from a Librarian with no scientific or engineering qualifications! Every operation that mines an Ore and extracts its valuable contents, end-ups with a remaining waste product; total tones in = total tons out. In Longonjo's case, for every ton of Ore that is mined, they will end up with roughly 5 kilograms of MREC; and 995 kilograms of Waste. That Waste will contain the same few hundred grams of Thorium and Uranium that was originally there in the Ore; it is simple primary school maths, assuming that you got past your 2+2? Pensana has stated on numerous occasions, that this Waste (which contains all of the Radionuclides as it did in the in-situ Ore), will be emplaced, contained and finally sealed within a fully engineered Tailings storage facility, which is currently under construction. Neither the concentration, locality nor the environmental impact of those Radionuclides will have changed dramatically or detrimentally in any way. In fact, containing them in an engineered structure within the mine site will now prevent them and any other potentially detrimental pollutants from in future leaching into the water-table, as would eventually have been the case if the mine were not developed. This is precisely what Lynas and MP have been told they must do with their Waste and Radionuclides by their respective Regulatory bodies. It is a great pity that you do not have the guts to take issue with this same subject with your paymasters, where it is already a significant and well recognised problem. All of those RE mines in Laos and Myanmar with CCP sanctioned Chinese operators who don't even try to contain their pollutants, simply pumping their waste and all of its contained poisons straight into the nearest creeks. It won't be too long before the Irrawaddy, Selwin and Mekong rivers become dead zones ~ what price ESG then? But no, dogs should never bite the hands that feed them.",

My friendly AI chatbot assures me that: \"The average time for a mining company to receive assay results after finishing a drilling program is typically several weeks to several months, commonly ranging from 3 to 12 weeks\" So here we are almost exactly 12 weeks on - every reason to believe the results are already in the bag, back at Pensana HQ, wherever that might be. Any views on what Pensana might do about announcing them,  if the results are good or if they are bad, in view of the current (depressed and depressing) SP and the upcoming Nasdaq float? The other drilling survey (Longonjo reserve enhancement) announced mid-Nov 25 starts around now in early 2026, but Pensana isn't going to wait till all the those results come in, but plans to strategically 'drip-feed' results, released throughout 2026 as they become available, or more likely - when the time is right..",

I'd imagine PIs are now entrenched and disinclined to buy or sell - just waiting for pay day.    As the Nasdaq has preferences about any intending listing company's liquidity (should be consistently above 0.1% (average daily volume/shares in issue) and the PRE register is soon to balloon to 430M+) - maybe there's an issue here for the Nasdaq listing? Today's trading volume is well down - usual abnormal trading - mostly bot's calling the tune, and over 100 tiny O trades.  I doubt if there's much regular trading going on at all....",

AI-integrated programs make detecting fraud much more efficient within the London Stock Exchange. They present a much lower percentage of false positives, as well as an almost instantaneous detection of suspicious activity. This aligns with our results, which showed true positive rates of 92.7-96% for AI versus 78.3% for traditional systems, and false positives reduced from 51.4% to 11.9%.\" Apparently, LSE AI Surveillance can run a complete market abuse analysis of a selected stock's trading patterns in a few seconds, compared to days using their previous investigation tools.

          "content": "Tbow/Fregatr       There are lots of reasons why very small deals can feature quite innocently in a share's daily trading pattern. However, when you start to add up ALL of the oddities in PRE trading, it begins to strain probability and belief that nothing is going on. The fact that microtrades are predominantly O-type.  But the fact that they happen in runs which are auto-traded by the dozens in a second or two - means they have a corporate/agency origin. The fact that they always take place at specific times eg: ahead of LSE trading and NYSE trading, less so at other times and at the end of trading. The fact that a year ago - there were zero microtrades in daily PRE dealing. The fact that microtrades can now make up over 50% of all the deals in a single day,  literally hundreds go through each and every day now. The fact that they are both buys and sells - but often appear in runs of each, rather than randomly one or the other. The fact that there are often ordered sequences of microtrade sizes eg: 2 shares then 4 then 8 then 12 etc all the way up to 50 The fact that much of daily volume is down to a small number of large deals (AT and O) while hundreds of microtrades go through and generate less then 1% of day volume total The fact that AT bot trades are often executed in blocks of buys and sells before and after a burst of microtrades. The fact that PENSANA is highly unlikely to be in a substantial number of tracker funds( which often need to batch up their microtrades for portfolio balancing reasons). The fact that certain O deals which have 2 or 3 digits of precision on their ticker price, also account for a substantial part of the large volume trades (suggesting specific brokers are involved).  Not one of these 2/3 digit deals has ever been a microtrade. There's more, but I have failed to work out what, if anything is going on. Apparently private investors can raise concerns about a share's LSE trading by emailing the LSE's Market Supervision team (which monitors trading) at marketsupervisionenquiries@lseg.com. Me?  I like a quiet life - maybe this is one for you SmartPunter?",

Market Screener is good - alllows you to watch the deals go through on the candlestick chart - set it for 5 minute interval - and it continuously updates the price ticker for the last trade - green/buy, red/sell -  it also  seems to be more up to date than ADVFN by the minute and if you set MA lines they too will adjust in real time to show the trend direction of the 5min SP. ADVFN lets you browse every LSE PRE trade today up to 15 mins ago, and I use it to see how AT trades and O microtrades are going. My judgement today was based on ADVFN showing the (now) usual flurry of synchronised O microtrades (signalling trades?) around the 14:30  NYSE open - which I assume to be the MMs preparing for the rest of the day's action on bid-offer and spread.  I noticed that there was a preponderance of AT/Bot block trades (groups of buys then sells then buys)  from 12:00 up to 14:30 with not much at all going on by way of O trades, which I interpret as MMs setting the target price and tightening the spread for best liquidity. Back over on Market Screener, I see on the 5-min chart there's a 14:30 pickup in the SP and buying, so assume that's influenced by US dealing, as there's no particular reason why LSE buyers would delay their buys till PM in the face of a rising PRE SP from the start of LSE trading at 08:30. And that's about it - combination of timing, short-term trading patterns and my suspicious mind about price manipulation.....",

You clearly believe Pensana is a dead duck which is fine we all can have our own opinions, but can you give any good reason for your FUD posts other than an obsessive personal grievance?

In March 2025, Pensana received a US$3.4million Technical Assistance Grant from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) specifically for studies into the development of Coola and its potential for downstream processing, to accelerate the path to a resource definition. The DFC and  no doubt FSDEA too, surely want he JORC potential verified ASAP for both Coola and Sulima West in order to promote and de-risk potential future investment in Longonjo output  refining capacity.   As of course must Pensana's offtake customers,  and supply chain partners in the US. Pensana's Coola Exploration Licence was issued in May 2020, 6 years ago,  but understandably the lack of funding during the wilderness years 2020-24 meant Longonjo had to take priority.   Pensana also owns a 90% interest in Coola compared to 84% (possibly down to 64% after dilution), in Longonjo. I believe that first Coola licence (2020) was only for 2 years, subsequently extended to a total of 7 years, so expires in15 months in May 2027. Not a lot of time left to complete the full delineation drilling for a JORC estimate, but I believe Pensana is speeding up on-site evaluation using a SciAps X-555 REE Analyzer (X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) to bypass the external laboratory sample analysis delay loop, to rapidly set ore boundaries and locate drilling hot-spots to speed the final-stage drilling delineation and drilling The  clock is ticking, so the pressure will be on Pensana to publicise any early good news.  This has to come soon anyway,  to keep their stake-holders onboard, happy and confident. I'm optimistic there will be a Coola RNS timed to put a rocket under the Nasdaq listing.",
