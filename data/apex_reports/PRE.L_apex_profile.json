The programme is designed to provide both detailed geological and grade control information ahead of the commencement of mining and stockpiling/blending activities in early 2027 alongside the resource expansion drilling programme announced on 17 November 2025.\nTwo reverse circulation drilling rigs are planned to be mobilised ahead of drilling activities throughout the anticipated dry season from May through to October 2026. The programme anticipates completion of a 10 x 10 metre drill grid across the weathered run-of-mine from the initial pit(s) production zones/areas.\nThe Longonjo deposit comprises a near-surface blanket of high-grade, NdPr-rich total rare earth oxides (TREO), with an average depth of approximately 30 metres. Previous drilling has confirmed that mineralisation extends to depths in excess of 100 metres beneath the current resource, indicating significant potential to increase the resource base through further drilling.\nDuring the campaign samples will also be collected at depth to develop a detailed understanding of the full vertical extent of the mineralization and support assessment of the potential for an increase in inferred resources from the existing 313 million tonnes at 1.43% TREO towards one billion tonnes at a similar grade - which would make it one of the world's largest rare earth deposits currently in development .\nA laboratory is being procured for delivery to site alongside drill rig mobilisation. This containerised unit will include sample preparation facilities and an automated XRF analyser enabling timeous and cost saving multi-element analysis on site. Grade control drilling will be ongoing for most of the Longonjo life of mine, staying a year ahead of mine planning.\nThese results will further support the current mine and stockpile blending plan developed with Practara, well before commissioning, and enhances the existing dataset.\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is developing one of the world's largest and highest-grade magnet metal rare earth deposits which will produce initially 20,000 tpa of a clean high value MREC including both LREE and HREE. The plan is to expand production to 40,000 tpa of MREC once initial operations have been established.\nThe Longonjo operation will extract, concentrate, calcine and chemically refine the free dig material to produce a high-value MREC which will be railed 273 kilometers in containers to the Atlantic port of Lobito for export.\nPensana is looking to establish a world class fully integrated mine-to-magnet supply chain in partnership with US partners and with backing from U.S. Government.\nThe Longonjo rare earths deposit is located adjacent to the Lobito rail corridor approximately 60 kilometers west of the provincial capital of Huambo in central Angola.\nThe project currently under development comprises an open pit, concentrator and recovery plants, tailings storage facility (designed to meet the requirements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management), process water supply, bulk power supply, mine infrastructure, workshops, offices, accommodation village, recreational facilities, and other associated infrastructure.\nThe information contained within this announcement is considered by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No.596/2014.

A significant amount of design work has now been completed followed by the efficient deployment of capital in establishing the site infrastructure. The decision to construct the process plant on a modular basis is important as it provides us with improved cost and delivery control. The team continues to strive towards completion of the significant workstreams currently underway. Whilst there is still much to do there is a growing sense of achievement as the project rapidly emerges.\"\nPictures of the site construction activities are available on the Company's website\nwww.pensana.co.uk\nHighlights include:\nGrupo Nov, the Angolan civil and earthworks company already involved in the Longonjo early works program, has completed site preparation and has commenced construction of the SRK designed Tailings Storage Facility according to Global Industry Standards on Tailings Management,\nThe concrete batching plant has been established to provide for the civils and piling works required for the senior load bearing foundations of major equipment items on the compacted process plant terrace area,\nNCP has completed fabrication of the 2 MW regrind circuit ball mill which awaits delivery to site once foundations are complete during the next quarter,\nClark in Brazil has commenced construction of the 250 tonne-per-day modular sulphuric acid plant after the completion of the Hazard and Operability Study review in late 2025,\nProcurement of all long lead items has been enabled to meet the targeted construction and budget schedules post conclusion of the detailed design processes by Lycopodium and Pro Process,\nFollowing procurement completion of the balance of the major capital items including flotation columns, calciner, thickeners and nano-filtration units, all detailed design and fabrication schedules remain on track for delivery from the respective vendors,\nAdditional plant storage and laydown areas have been completed ahead of deliveries and installation due from mid-2026 onwards, and\nRegional government recognition and awards have been received for the Company's positive economic and social impact, including community outreach programmes guided by IFC and Equator Principles risk management compliance.\nPermanent power, potable water, wastewater treatment, telecommunications, and site security infra-structure were installed and commissioned in 2025. This infrastructure is now able to fully support the growing construction workforce as the project executes the large-scale construction workstreams through 2026 under the leadership of Country Manager Geraldine Tchimbali.\nSafety remains a core strength of the on-site team, underpinned by a sustainability-led owner-operator approach and close collaboration with quality engineering and delivery partners to reduce risk. The project continues to follow a modular construction philosophy within the detailed design process to maintain construction schedule certainty and reducing risk associated with on-site implementation.\nAs the on-site workforce increases towards the peak of 750 on-site personnel, the Company is actively encouraging integration with the surrounding community through the use of local accommodation, services, and established transport links to nearby towns.\nAbout Pensana\nPensana is developing one of the world's largest and highest-grade magnet metal rare earth deposits which will produce initially 20,000 tpa of a clean high value MREC including both LREE and HREE.
