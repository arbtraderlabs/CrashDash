      "current_state": "The business is still scaling \u2013 it has a solid user base but is burning cash as it expands its platform and content library. With no recent earnings or partnership announcements, the stock has been quiet and has traded near its lows in recent weeks."

      "bear_case": "The main downside is that the company may continue to burn cash if it fails to secure a new partnership or revenue stream. However, most of the worst\u2011case loss is already behind the current price.",
