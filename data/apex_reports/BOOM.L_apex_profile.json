This represents significant upside opportunity through medium-term value creation in video podcast monetisation and the expansion of the UK podcast market\n\u00b7\nGroup cash at 31 December 2025 of US$4.2 million (31 December 2024: US$3.9 million), with a further US$3.4 million available via an overdraft facility\n\u00b7\nConclusion of the final onerous contract on 31 December 2025, which had been provided for on 30 June 2023, with the Board expecting adjusted EBITDA in 2026 to once again serve as a proxy for cash generation\nKey Q4 2025 and post-period commercial developments\n\u00b7\nLaunch of a commercial partnership with Spotify, which will support the development of Audioboom's video monetisation engine through expanded advertising and subscription opportunities\n\u00b7\nRecord quarterly revenue from our UK operation following the successful integration of Adelicious\n\u00b7\nFurther expansion of the Audioboom Creator Network through a new commercial and distribution partnership with\nHistory Daily\n, an award-winning daily podcast which has been downloaded more than 70 million times since it launched in 2021\nStrategic Review\nThe Strategic Review announced on 3 October remains ongoing, and the Board expects to provide an update on or before the publication of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.\nStuart Last, CEO of Audioboom, commented:\n\"2025 marked an inflection point in Audioboom's transition from a podcast network to a scaled audio and video platform. The accretive acquisition of Adelicious in July created instant scale in the UK market and highlights the growth opportunity that exists through disciplined M&A. The additional inventory from the Adelicious network fuelled Showcase, supporting its continued expansion and record revenue contribution.\nVideo growth was also key to this transition, as we developed a market-leading position with 13 of the top 100 Youtube video podcasts in the Audioboom Creator Network. Podscribe's ranker recognised us as the number 1 network for video, and our new commercial partnership with Spotify will support our 2026 focus on enhancing our video revenue engine. It will bring new advertising options as well as direct revenue from subscriptions - this will be a step forward in ensuring we maximise value for our video creators.\nOur financial performance in 2025 was very pleasing, with record revenue and adjusted EBITDA ahead of market expectations for the year. Our gross profit grew at double the pace of revenue, reflecting our continued focus on developing higher-quality revenue. Our increased gross margin combined with our stable operating costs to deliver 54% annual adjusted EBITDA growth - in Q4 our EBITDA margin hit 9%, highlighting the gearing effect of our business model as we drive revenue forward.\nI am excited about 2026. We will have record inventory levels, new international opportunities, and a continued focus on growing our platform model. I would like to express my appreciation to the Audioboom team and to thank shareholders for their continued support and belief in the future of the Company.\"\n1) Financial information for the year ended 31 December 2025 remains subject to audit\n2) Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, share based payments, non-cash foreign exchange movements, materia",

The objective of the Strategic Review is to accelerate Audioboom's growth by building on its proven, scaleable and profitable business model and to capitalise on its position as global leader in podcasting.\nPossible outcomes of the Strategic Review may include new investment to fund further acquisitions, a substantial acquisition or reverse takeover, a sale of either the Company's US or UK businesses or a sale of the entire issued and to be issued share capital by way of an offer under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Code\").\nFollowing the announcement of the Strategic Review, a number of interested parties have been in contact with the Company and, accordingly, the Advisers are now engaged in preliminary discussions with them.

Just anger, insults, and a load of certainty pulled out of thin air. No numbers, no valuation, no workings \u2014 which is usually a dead giveaway that this is about resentment, not reality. If this was genuinely \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d, you\u2019d be posting figures, not ranting about \u201ctinpot podcasters\u201d. Strategic reviews taking months is completely normal. Acting like it should be wrapped up over a coffee just shows you don\u2019t know how these things actually work. If you think it\u2019s worth \u00a35, explain why. Otherwise this just reads like someone with a grudge trying to sound clever after the event.",

They are indeed two very separate events. The trading update confirmed the following, 'The Strategic Review announced on 3 October remains ongoing, and the Board expects to provide an update on or before the publication of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.' What more do you want given the reporting rules? In addition, this was an end of year tradng update too and the business is operating and performing at a completely different level to the statement re the strategic review conducted a few years ago. The current trading results are both extremely robust and exciting while the straegic review is being managed by a completely different level of advisor to those that you refer to in the past. I do not believe any reference to the strategic review should have been handled any differently, however, yes I do agree that it was perhaps not what many short term SH's were seeking.",

Here\u2019s the relevant section in the RNS: Q4 RPM (average revenue per 1,000 downloads and views) of US$55.23; as expected, lower than the prior year (Q4 2024: US$75.62) due to the increase in lower-yield video views and UK downloads. This represents significant upside opportunity through medium-term value creation in video podcast monetisation and the expansion of the UK podcast market. Another poster misrepresented the Adjusted EBITDA which is actually $5.1m. Not many in this sector are actually making a profit. Is it really worth it for these posters, who intersperse waffle with imprudent remarks to be here. Well yes as I suppose it is. Some said we all have different agendas. True. Those who are long term shareholders and want to see Audioboom succeed and maximise shareholders return. What\u2019s wrong with that. Actually up around 150% in past 6 months. Or the other agenda is to make posts here which are non factual and generally dishonest. As for the 12% fall over the past two days that\u2019s insignificant in the long term and we\u2019ve seen this many times before. Whatever comes out of the strategic review will be positive. It\u2019s been debated before whether this will be a sale or an acquisition of another company. Because of the time frame I don\u2019t think a sale is currently on the cards as the directors want to maximise value and probably the current offers are low ball. My opinion is acquisition of a good company like Adelicious or a merger. Over and out, for now!",

          "content": "Having done some research and some professional input I\u2019d like to delve into the RPM metric a bit more as it\u2019s been twisted and thus the facts need to be given context. The opportunities offered by my explanation below offer strong and increasing growth to revenue and profitability which will be key in the strategic review process. Interested parties will be hugely interested in what the future holds for Audioboom. RPM is a yield metric - how much value the company generates from downloads and views of the podcasts. It can be viewed across the entire Audioboom network (all downloads and views), or can be cut to view and compare a subset of downloads/views... ie, individual countries, content genres, single or groups of podcasts, and consumption type - audio and/or video. In 2024 the network RPM was at its strongest because the AB network was made up of mainly US consumption and audio consumption. The US is the most commercially developed region for podcasting and Audioboom had spent 10 years developing their monetisation engine for audio. Fast forward to the end of 2025 and the make-up of their network has changed considerably. They added 66% more network consumption - much of that was from the Adelicious acquisition (ie UK consumption) and video consumption because of the sharp growth of video podcasting. The UK podcast advertising market is considerably less developed than the US, and video monetisation is at a much earlier stage than audio - so those 60m+ new views and downloads carry a much lower RPM naturally. In turn that brings down the network RPM that AB publish - but there's no doubt that they're still doing a great job on the RPM for US and audio in general. On Stuart's X thread this week he said video RPM was less than half the audio RPM and that the Spotify partnership will be the first step to closing that value gap. In the UK the combined Audioboom and Adelicious sales operation will be moving quickly to close the UK value gap too. So this is all upside opportunity. In no way has anything weakened at Audioboom, they just have a huge amount of new underdeveloped inventory that they will now be looking to exploit.",

LEARN the SP of BOOM was 285p last July and 800p last week, so expect some retracement from time to time Your DEC has gone nowhere but down for a few years now. LEARN to buy the right shares B@stard. Now here is your quotes of your DEC. below. \" JC01 Posted in: DEC - 21 Nov 2024 09:17 Keep the faith. Sadly we can\u2019t pick all winners. I have never claimed to be an expert. My current delusion is we have better times ahead So much for the months of conspiracy theories that it\u2019s the shorts keeping the SP down Hopefully we all have some winners to compensate for this dog if a long term holder . having suffered crucifying sp losses ( down 65% since mid 2021) Yep the old boy\u2019s corrupt network keeps on working.\" ------Keep learning from the Master. ------- Next week is bouncing back, the day I will tell you later",

Sell a few, buy some back - forget to buy some back and buy in higher - miss the dip because you had no conviction. Where does it end...? It doesn't - it goes on.... Well played to all playing the game - and there are many and many that will try to convince you they are not. Fundies or charts - there's your two dynamics. Are you playing both or one, or one at a time or asleep as i have been for weeks not really bothered as my own logic goes with chart action generally if i have the time to cover it but it's AIM and stops can hurt and we do or we don't and we avoid if we have conviction. A holding of \u00a320K (me) bothered by the fluctuations and knowing the patterns post updates etc - no - it always bounces back. Large accounts\u00a3100k/ \u00a3200K/\u00a3300K+ are they ripping some profit and accumulating more - of course they are - who wouldn't? If you're in that position you have time at the screens to milk money because rich money milks further money - providing you're sane and playing the game - whether you're being honest  - or just making it all up - excuse the pun! \ud83d\ude0a Don't shoot me if it doesn't go the way I predict which is V up - as I'm chart focussed but also fundamentally driven by whats evolving here in this space and in particular with #BOOM Bounce & Rip 880+ next week 1 day chart everything above the cloud +++ 1 week timeframe: https://invst.ly/1erp38 1 day timeframe: https://invst.ly/1erp3n still a ripper... 1 month: Uhh -We break into and hold in that orange cloud, we are gaining. https://invst.ly/1erp4h Caveats: The Orange Imbecile has disruptive powers though TACO has to date provided positive trading results despite the initial dip. It's a mad world - and everyone is trading the arse out of what time they have available and what risk they are comfortable with. BOOM has gravitas - just gotta weather the pullbacks and add if you feel comfortable is my approach just based on Techs with the added bonus the business is revenue generating and going to be acquired or split via some yet to be determined model. GLA - Happy trading - Happy holding if that's your fancy. Just remember - some do \"Make it all up\" and make it all up might make it all up - who knows - the markets!",

I am excited about 2026. We will have record inventory levels, new international opportunities, and a continued focus on growing our platform model.

The annual EBITDA was 5.1m so to get 40% in the last quarter shows where this is headed and then the dropping the onerous contracts in 2026 i am sure we will see some write ups in the financial press and potential broker notes next couple of days.

          "content": "Today Audioboom released our 2025 Trading Update - it was another strong year of growth with record financial performance and some transformative operational achievements. Let's start with the numbers... $5.1m of EBITDA... this was a record for the business, was up 54% vs 2024, and beat our market expectation $80.1m of revenue... another record and up 10% vs 2024 $17m of gross profit... growing at double the pace of revenue, reflecting our focus on higher quality revenue These numbers really highlight how EBITDA gears in our scalable business model. Our OPEX is steady and consistent as the Audioboom platform is efficient and scalable - revenue growth gears quickly to EBITDA at these levels It was another great year for Showcase - our scalable, higher gross margin advertising marketplace - with record revenue of $30.4m (up 31%). It was fuelled by a ton of new ad inventory from Adelicious - just one of the upsides following our acquistion of that business in July. Talking of which... The acquisition of Adelicious and our strong moves in video podcasting marked an inflection point in our transition to a scaled platform business. Buying Adelicious proved that our platform is primed for supporting consolidation - for example... Pre transaction Adelicious delivered ~$600k per month of revenue, post transition it's above $900k. 50% growth by plugging into our platform and being supercharged by the Audioboom distribution and monetization engine. Further disciplined M&A will provide growth opportunity We became a leader in video in 2025 - Podscribe placed us as the #1 video podcast network. In 2026 we need to maximize the value of video podcasting which is under-developed when compared to audio-only podcasting. Our partnership with Spotify is the first step... Our current monetization engine for audio-only generates around $71 RPM on average. For video it's less than half of that. With Spotify we'll have more options to monetize video content - helping to close that value gap and make us the go-to video platform too I can't talk much about 2026 right now, other than to say it's started well and I'm excited about the year ahead",

To avoid a short-term pullback, it probably needed something truly \u201cwow\u201d. That said, I\u2019m still very happy with the update. This feels more like profit-taking than any change in the underlying story. As one herd sells, another is clearly stepping in to buy. Worth remembering that Dowgate were buyers around 770p \u2014 and they\u2019re certainly not momentum chasers. The fundamentals remain solid, the growth trajectory is intact, and management continues to execute well. I\u2019m sitting tight on these and letting the story play out.",

The brief statement came alongside a trading update showing a strong end to the year. Audioboom said the review remains ongoing, with an update due on or before publication of its full-year results in April. Such reviews typically explore options ranging from remaining independent to a sale or partnership. The update contrasted with robust financial performance. Adjusted earnings rose 54% to about $5.1 million in 2025, while revenue increased 10% to roughly $80.4 million, both ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by higher-quality advertising and the expansion of Showcase, its global marketplace, where revenue rose 31%. Fourth-quarter performance was particularly strong, helped by the Adelicious acquisition, although average revenue per thousand downloads fell as video and UK audiences grew. Despite the shares slipping, the figures underline a business gaining scale as strategic uncertainty lingers",

AUDIOBOOM continues to execute on its strategy, with the update again reinforcing that the core podcasting model is scaling, diversified, and moving in the right direction. Management didn\u2019t need to oversell anything \u2013 it was simply a steady confirmation that audience growth, monetisation and platform strength are translating into improving financial performance. This isn\u2019t a concept story anymore, it\u2019s an operating media business with real momentum. Also notable is that Dowgate are still buying. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident. Institutions don\u2019t keep adding unless they see value ahead, not behind, and it suggests confidence in both the numbers and the trajectory. Given the pattern of recent activity, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see another chunky buy land in the next few days. For those willing to look past the day-to-day noise, the bigger picture here remains very compelling.",

They are indeed two very separate events. The trading update confirmed the following, 'The Strategic Review announced on 3 October remains ongoing, and the Board expects to provide an update on or before the publication of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.' What more do you want given the reporting rules? In addition, this was an end of year tradng update too and the business is operating and performing at a completely different level to the statement re the strategic review conducted a few years ago. The current trading results are both extremely robust and exciting while the straegic review is being managed by a completely different level of advisor to those that you refer to in the past. I do not believe any reference to the strategic review should have been handled any differently, however, yes I do agree that it was perhaps not what many short term SH's were seeking.",

          "content": "Some interesting posts by the usual gang who come out to spread their take on Audioboom. The only comment one poster could make was to criticise RPM. Here\u2019s the relevant section in the RNS: Q4 RPM (average revenue per 1,000 downloads and views) of US$55.23; as expected, lower than the prior year (Q4 2024: US$75.62) due to the increase in lower-yield video views and UK downloads. This represents significant upside opportunity through medium-term value creation in video podcast monetisation and the expansion of the UK podcast market. Another poster misrepresented the Adjusted EBITDA which is actually $5.1m. Not many in this sector are actually making a profit. Is it really worth it for these posters, who intersperse waffle with imprudent remarks to be here. Well yes as I suppose it is. Some said we all have different agendas. True. Those who are long term shareholders and want to see Audioboom succeed and maximise shareholders return. What\u2019s wrong with that. Actually up around 150% in past 6 months. Or the other agenda is to make posts here which are non factual and generally dishonest. As for the 12% fall over the past two days that\u2019s insignificant in the long term and we\u2019ve seen this many times before. Whatever comes out of the strategic review will be positive. It\u2019s been debated before whether this will be a sale or an acquisition of another company. Because of the time frame I don\u2019t think a sale is currently on the cards as the directors want to maximise value and probably the current offers are low ball. My opinion is acquisition of a good company like Adelicious or a merger. Over and out, for now!",

They are also man or woman enough to know that they will incur losses, as well as profits, and take it all in their stride because they can take responsibility for their own actions. However we don't have those, we have aggressive spivs who seem to think the world owes them a living. Nothing wrong with biting back, IMO. I find it difficult to believe the age claimed by one here. Just too brattish. You don't reach that age with that attitude. Events educate you and you know better. Perhaps certain posters spend considerable time getting up \"Dutch courage\" in liquid form before posting their nasty and frequently dishonest comments here. That could explain some of their open nastiness. BTW, It is my opinion that we all have one agenda, to make money. We just use different methods. Genuine traders and investors understand that.",

The opportunities offered by my explanation below offer strong and increasing growth to revenue and profitability which will be key in the strategic review process. Interested parties will be hugely interested in what the future holds for Audioboom. RPM is a yield metric - how much value the company generates from downloads and views of the podcasts. It can be viewed across the entire Audioboom network (all downloads and views), or can be cut to view and compare a subset of downloads/views... ie, individual countries, content genres, single or groups of podcasts, and consumption type - audio and/or video. In 2024 the network RPM was at its strongest because the AB network was made up of mainly US consumption and audio consumption. The US is the most commercially developed region for podcasting and Audioboom had spent 10 years developing their monetisation engine for audio. Fast forward to the end of 2025 and the make-up of their network has changed considerably. They added 66% more network consumption - much of that was from the Adelicious acquisition (ie UK consumption) and video consumption because of the sharp growth of video podcasting. The UK podcast advertising market is considerably less developed than the US, and video monetisation is at a much earlier stage than audio - so those 60m+ new views and downloads carry a much lower RPM naturally. In turn that brings down the network RPM that AB publish - but there's no doubt that they're still doing a great job on the RPM for US and audio in general. On Stuart's X thread this week he said video RPM was less than half the audio RPM and that the Spotify partnership will be the first step to closing that value gap. In the UK the combined Audioboom and Adelicious sales operation will be moving quickly to close the UK value gap too. So this is all upside opportunity. In no way has anything weakened at Audioboom, they just have a huge amount of new underdeveloped inventory that they will now be looking to exploit.",

Sell a few, buy some back - forget to buy some back and buy in higher - miss the dip because you had no conviction. Where does it end...? It doesn't - it goes on.... Well played to all playing the game - and there are many and many that will try to convince you they are not. Fundies or charts - there's your two dynamics. Are you playing both or one, or one at a time or asleep as i have been for weeks not really bothered as my own logic goes with chart action generally if i have the time to cover it but it's AIM and stops can hurt and we do or we don't and we avoid if we have conviction. A holding of \u00a320K (me) bothered by the fluctuations and knowing the patterns post updates etc - no - it always bounces back. Large accounts\u00a3100k/ \u00a3200K/\u00a3300K+ are they ripping some profit and accumulating more - of course they are - who wouldn't? If you're in that position you have time at the screens to milk money because rich money milks further money - providing you're sane and playing the game - whether you're being honest  - or just making it all up - excuse the pun! \ud83d\ude0a Don't shoot me if it doesn't go the way I predict which is V up - as I'm chart focussed but also fundamentally driven by whats evolving here in this space and in particular with #BOOM Bounce & Rip 880+ next week 1 day chart everything above the cloud +++ 1 week timeframe: https://invst.ly/1erp38 1 day timeframe: https://invst.ly/1erp3n still a ripper... 1 month: Uhh -We break into and hold in that orange cloud, we are gaining. https://invst.ly/1erp4h Caveats: The Orange Imbecile has disruptive powers though TACO has to date provided positive trading results despite the initial dip. It's a mad world - and everyone is trading the arse out of what time they have available and what risk they are comfortable with. BOOM has gravitas - just gotta weather the pullbacks and add if you feel comfortable is my approach just based on Techs with the added bonus the business is revenue generating and going to be acquired or split via some yet to be determined model.

I\u2019d stick to hacking around on Ailsa and boring everyone in the bar about your compulsive buying of watches etc. I thought Trump would have had a better vetting process for membership of his course.",

Our increased gross margin combined with our stable operating costs to deliver 54% annual adjusted EBITDA growth - in Q4 our EBITDA margin hit 9%, highlighting the gearing effect of our business model as we drive revenue forward. I am excited about 2026. We will have record inventory levels, new international opportunities, and a continued focus on growing our platform model. I would like to express my appreciation to the Audioboom team and to thank shareholders for their continued support and belief in the future of the Company.\"",

The annual EBITDA was 5.1m so to get 40% in the last quarter shows where this is headed and then the dropping the onerous contracts in 2026 i am sure we will see some write ups in the financial press and potential broker notes next couple of days.  Very positive result.",

          "content": "Today Audioboom released our 2025 Trading Update - it was another strong year of growth with record financial performance and some transformative operational achievements. Let's start with the numbers... $5.1m of EBITDA... this was a record for the business, was up 54% vs 2024, and beat our market expectation $80.1m of revenue... another record and up 10% vs 2024 $17m of gross profit... growing at double the pace of revenue, reflecting our focus on higher quality revenue These numbers really highlight how EBITDA gears in our scalable business model. Our OPEX is steady and consistent as the Audioboom platform is efficient and scalable - revenue growth gears quickly to EBITDA at these levels It was another great year for Showcase - our scalable, higher gross margin advertising marketplace - with record revenue of $30.4m (up 31%). It was fuelled by a ton of new ad inventory from Adelicious - just one of the upsides following our acquistion of that business in July. Talking of which... The acquisition of Adelicious and our strong moves in video podcasting marked an inflection point in our transition to a scaled platform business. Buying Adelicious proved that our platform is primed for supporting consolidation - for example... Pre transaction Adelicious delivered ~$600k per month of revenue, post transition it's above $900k. 50% growth by plugging into our platform and being supercharged by the Audioboom distribution and monetization engine. Further disciplined M&A will provide growth opportunity We became a leader in video in 2025 - Podscribe placed us as the #1 video podcast network. In 2026 we need to maximize the value of video podcasting which is under-developed when compared to audio-only podcasting. Our partnership with Spotify is the first step... Our current monetization engine for audio-only generates around $71 RPM on average. For video it's less than half of that. With Spotify we'll have more options to monetize video content - helping to close that value gap and make us the go-to video platform too I can't talk much about 2026 right now, other than to say it's started well and I'm excited about the year ahead",

To avoid a short-term pullback, it probably needed something truly \u201cwow\u201d. That said, I\u2019m still very happy with the update. This feels more like profit-taking than any change in the underlying story. As one herd sells, another is clearly stepping in to buy. Worth remembering that Dowgate were buyers around 770p \u2014 and they\u2019re certainly not momentum chasers. The fundamentals remain solid, the growth trajectory is intact, and management continues to execute well. I\u2019m sitting tight on these and letting the story play out.",

The brief statement came alongside a trading update showing a strong end to the year. Audioboom said the review remains ongoing, with an update due on or before publication of its full-year results in April. Such reviews typically explore options ranging from remaining independent to a sale or partnership. The update contrasted with robust financial performance. Adjusted earnings rose 54% to about $5.1 million in 2025, while revenue increased 10% to roughly $80.4 million, both ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by higher-quality advertising and the expansion of Showcase, its global marketplace, where revenue rose 31%. Fourth-quarter performance was particularly strong, helped by the Adelicious acquisition, although average revenue per thousand downloads fell as video and UK audiences grew. Despite the shares slipping, the figures underline a business gaining scale as strategic uncertainty lingers",

Management didn\u2019t need to oversell anything \u2013 it was simply a steady confirmation that audience growth, monetisation and platform strength are translating into improving financial performance. This isn\u2019t a concept story anymore, it\u2019s an operating media business with real momentum. Also notable is that Dowgate are still buying. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident. Institutions don\u2019t keep adding unless they see value ahead, not behind, and it suggests confidence in both the numbers and the trajectory. Given the pattern of recent activity, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see another chunky buy land in the next few days.

They are indeed two very separate events. The trading update confirmed the following, 'The Strategic Review announced on 3 October remains ongoing, and the Board expects to provide an update on or before the publication of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.' What more do you want given the reporting rules? In addition, this was an end of year tradng update too and the business is operating and performing at a completely different level to the statement re the strategic review conducted a few years ago. The current trading results are both extremely robust and exciting while the straegic review is being managed by a completely different level of advisor to those that you refer to in the past. I do not believe any reference to the strategic review should have been handled any differently, however, yes I do agree that it was perhaps not what many short term SH's were seeking.",

          "content": "Some interesting posts by the usual gang who come out to spread their take on Audioboom. The only comment one poster could make was to criticise RPM. Here\u2019s the relevant section in the RNS: Q4 RPM (average revenue per 1,000 downloads and views) of US$55.23; as expected, lower than the prior year (Q4 2024: US$75.62) due to the increase in lower-yield video views and UK downloads. This represents significant upside opportunity through medium-term value creation in video podcast monetisation and the expansion of the UK podcast market. Another poster misrepresented the Adjusted EBITDA which is actually $5.1m. Not many in this sector are actually making a profit. Is it really worth it for these posters, who intersperse waffle with imprudent remarks to be here. Well yes as I suppose it is. Some said we all have different agendas. True. Those who are long term shareholders and want to see Audioboom succeed and maximise shareholders return. What\u2019s wrong with that. Actually up around 150% in past 6 months. Or the other agenda is to make posts here which are non factual and generally dishonest. As for the 12% fall over the past two days that\u2019s insignificant in the long term and we\u2019ve seen this many times before. Whatever comes out of the strategic review will be positive. It\u2019s been debated before whether this will be a sale or an acquisition of another company. Because of the time frame I don\u2019t think a sale is currently on the cards as the directors want to maximise value and probably the current offers are low ball. My opinion is acquisition of a good company like Adelicious or a merger. Over and out, for now!",

However we don't have those, we have aggressive spivs who seem to think the world owes them a living. Nothing wrong with biting back, IMO. I find it difficult to believe the age claimed by one here. Just too brattish. You don't reach that age with that attitude. Events educate you and you know better.

          "content": "Having done some research and some professional input I\u2019d like to delve into the RPM metric a bit more as it\u2019s been twisted and thus the facts need to be given context. The opportunities offered by my explanation below offer strong and increasing growth to revenue and profitability which will be key in the strategic review process. Interested parties will be hugely interested in what the future holds for Audioboom. RPM is a yield metric - how much value the company generates from downloads and views of the podcasts. It can be viewed across the entire Audioboom network (all downloads and views), or can be cut to view and compare a subset of downloads/views... ie, individual countries, content genres, single or groups of podcasts, and consumption type - audio and/or video. In 2024 the network RPM was at its strongest because the AB network was made up of mainly US consumption and audio consumption. The US is the most commercially developed region for podcasting and Audioboom had spent 10 years developing their monetisation engine for audio. Fast forward to the end of 2025 and the make-up of their network has changed considerably. They added 66% more network consumption - much of that was from the Adelicious acquisition (ie UK consumption) and video consumption because of the sharp growth of video podcasting. The UK podcast advertising market is considerably less developed than the US, and video monetisation is at a much earlier stage than audio - so those 60m+ new views and downloads carry a much lower RPM naturally. In turn that brings down the network RPM that AB publish - but there's no doubt that they're still doing a great job on the RPM for US and audio in general. On Stuart's X thread this week he said video RPM was less than half the audio RPM and that the Spotify partnership will be the first step to closing that value gap. In the UK the combined Audioboom and Adelicious sales operation will be moving quickly to close the UK value gap too. So this is all upside opportunity. In no way has anything weakened at Audioboom, they just have a huge amount of new underdeveloped inventory that they will now be looking to exploit.",

Sell a few, buy some back - forget to buy some back and buy in higher - miss the dip because you had no conviction. Where does it end...? It doesn't - it goes on.... Well played to all playing the game - and there are many and many that will try to convince you they are not. Fundies or charts - there's your two dynamics. Are you playing both or one, or one at a time or asleep as i have been for weeks not really bothered as my own logic goes with chart action generally if i have the time to cover it but it's AIM and stops can hurt and we do or we don't and we avoid if we have conviction. A holding of \u00a320K (me) bothered by the fluctuations and knowing the patterns post updates etc - no - it always bounces back. Large accounts\u00a3100k/ \u00a3200K/\u00a3300K+ are they ripping some profit and accumulating more - of course they are - who wouldn't? If you're in that position you have time at the screens to milk money because rich money milks further money - providing you're sane and playing the game - whether you're being honest  - or just making it all up - excuse the pun! \ud83d\ude0a Don't shoot me if it doesn't go the way I predict which is V up - as I'm chart focussed but also fundamentally driven by whats evolving here in this space and in particular with #BOOM Bounce & Rip 880+ next week 1 day chart everything above the cloud +++ 1 week timeframe: https://invst.ly/1erp38 1 day timeframe: https://invst.ly/1erp3n still a ripper... 1 month: Uhh -We break into and hold in that orange cloud, we are gaining. https://invst.ly/1erp4h Caveats: The Orange Imbecile has disruptive powers though TACO has to date provided positive trading results despite the initial dip. It's a mad world - and everyone is trading the arse out of what time they have available and what risk they are comfortable with. BOOM has gravitas - just gotta weather the pullbacks and add if you feel comfortable is my approach just based on Techs with the added bonus the business is revenue generating and going to be acquired or split via some yet to be determined model. GLA - Happy trading - Happy holding if that's your fancy. Just remember - some do \"Make it all up\" and make it all up might make it all up - who knows - the markets!",

          "content": "Hello BBB, When Dowgate declare a trade, they do so under the name of Dowgate Group, which is the parent of Dowgate Wealth and Dowgate Capital. So it could be either that is the underlying counterparty, Dowgate Wealth obviously for their own clients (including a trust they run on a contractual basis) or Dowgate Capital who can act on behalf of acquirers of the company, eg if they want to pick up cheap shares below the price they may have to make an offer at to be recommended by Audiobooms board. Both subsidiaries are obviously at arms length from each other due to conflicts, but in this instance I guess it is the Wealth side, primarily for the trust I mentioned (name escapes me at the moment but someone else whose posted on here knows it's name.) I say that because they recently raised capital and what Dowgate will do is buy shares to a target weight they have in their model portfolio for the trust, or indeed if they have gained other Wealth clients, it will be the same, but I doubt it's other clients, as the amounts involved would imply they have taken on some pretty hefty new individual clients recently. They will buy until that target weight is reached in the actual portfolio, and sell if it goes over. This is not trading when 'in the money' it is standard portfolio management practice. So it may seem weird if they buy one day and then sell at a loss the next, that its probably due to the rest of the portfolio dropping in value relative to Audioboom. Dowgate are a long term investor and will not be punting on prospects of a takeover, but on (and I agree 1000% on this) the long term prognosis for the industry and Audiobooms market share within it. The fact that Boom has no debt, will be collecting cash in 2026 due to expiration of onerous contracts and they re gaining traction in the video sphere, and the latter combined with the UK audio podcast market where both have massive amounts of room to increase the ad revenue, since the medium is undercharging given reach, trust with target audience, and in sum, the effectiveness of the advertising to collecting prospective customers. There are a host of other reasons too numerous to go in to here, and many have talked about them already, but Boom is an undervalued share as it sits at the moment in a growth market with a growing trajectory within that market. It is not even overvalued, quite the opposite. What's not too like, and yes the price will rise and fall as it trends upwards, nothing goes up straight, so profit taking will happen, but long term this is a beauty in my book. I know a few micro cap managers who think the same, but don't have the same asset size in their portfolio to become visible to us, via declaration on the RNS front. That's my take, and good luck to all.",

If Audioboom were looking at acquiring another company then I\u2019d assume it  would pay in shares and maybe cash, similar to the Adelicious deal. Therefore there would be a very good chance that Dowgate would be asked to participate in the cash raiding element  in return for AB shares. There would be discussions going on now and thus Dowgate would be allowed to deal in the market due to insider information. It\u2019s all a supposition and for discussion about Cavendish continuing to buy more shares in the market. Hope this clarifies. Good news Cavendish are buying in any event.",

There is nothing wrong with trading, but personally I believe that trading doesn't pay in the long run. Most of the traders on AIM are probably ex-broker market makers, made a few bob in bonuses and then retire, and off to trade on their on account to sustain an income. They do create liquidity which is good for the rest of us, but the nonsense posts are invariably from the trading community who verge on the 'market manipulation' threshold, trying to get less informed through greed and fear to buy and sell on the back of optimistic or disparaging remarks about the company concerned.  However in this case at the moment it is utter rubbish to be disparaging about the outlook for Audioboom. Yes there are sometimes some stupid comments like - 'it's going to \u00a310 in the next 1/2 an hour' type stuff, and they are happy chappies, but they're probably trading too. I often ask myself would you make those comments in person direct to the face of those that they are directed at? It always amazes me why being incognito behind a keyboard enables some people to behave with total lack of civility. I'm not aiming this at you necessarily, and in a fit of pique I have found myself doing similar for which I apologise to all those in receipt. Maybe I'll make it over to play the Aisla some time and meet you in person, after all I live on the east coast, but please for all those reading this post, lets grow up and stop misbehaving like children.",

          "content": "Hello BBB, When Dowgate declare a trade, they do so under the name of Dowgate Group, which is the parent of Dowgate Wealth and Dowgate Capital. So it could be either that is the underlying counterparty, Dowgate Wealth obviously for their own clients (including a trust they run on a contractual basis) or Dowgate Capital who can act on behalf of acquirers of the company, eg if they want to pick up cheap shares below the price they may have to make an offer at to be recommended by Audiobooms board. Both subsidiaries are obviously at arms length from each other due to conflicts, but in this instance I guess it is the Wealth side, primarily for the trust I mentioned (name escapes me at the moment but someone else whose posted on here knows it's name.) I say that because they recently raised capital and what Dowgate will do is buy shares to a target weight they have in their model portfolio for the trust, or indeed if they have gained other Wealth clients, it will be the same, but I doubt it's other clients, as the amounts involved would imply they have taken on some pretty hefty new individual clients recently. They will buy until that target weight is reached in the actual portfolio, and sell if it goes over. This is not trading when 'in the money' it is standard portfolio management practice. So it may seem weird if they buy one day and then sell at a loss the next, that its probably due to the rest of the portfolio dropping in value relative to Audioboom. Dowgate are a long term investor and will not be punting on prospects of a takeover, but on (and I agree 1000% on this) the long term prognosis for the industry and Audiobooms market share within it. The fact that Boom has no debt, will be collecting cash in 2026 due to expiration of onerous contracts and they re gaining traction in the video sphere, and the latter combined with the UK audio podcast market where both have massive amounts of room to increase the ad revenue, since the medium is undercharging given reach, trust with target audience, and in sum, the effectiveness of the advertising to collecting prospective customers. There are a host of other reasons too numerous to go in to here, and many have talked about them already, but Boom is an undervalued share as it sits at the moment in a growth market with a growing trajectory within that market. It is not even overvalued, quite the opposite. What's not too like, and yes the price will rise and fall as it trends upwards, nothing goes up straight, so profit taking will happen, but long term this is a beauty in my book. I know a few micro cap managers who think the same, but don't have the same asset size in their portfolio to become visible to us, via declaration on the RNS front. That's my take, and good luck to all.",

If Audioboom were looking at acquiring another company then I\u2019d assume it  would pay in shares and maybe cash, similar to the Adelicious deal. Therefore there would be a very good chance that Dowgate would be asked to participate in the cash raiding element  in return for AB shares. There would be discussions going on now and thus Dowgate would be allowed to deal in the market due to insider information. It\u2019s all a supposition and for discussion about Cavendish continuing to buy more shares in the market. Hope this clarifies. Good news Cavendish are buying in any event.",

There is nothing wrong with trading, but personally I believe that trading doesn't pay in the long run. Most of the traders on AIM are probably ex-broker market makers, made a few bob in bonuses and then retire, and off to trade on their on account to sustain an income. They do create liquidity which is good for the rest of us, but the nonsense posts are invariably from the trading community who verge on the 'market manipulation' threshold, trying to get less informed through greed and fear to buy and sell on the back of optimistic or disparaging remarks about the company concerned.  However in this case at the moment it is utter rubbish to be disparaging about the outlook for Audioboom. Yes there are sometimes some stupid comments like - 'it's going to \u00a310 in the next 1/2 an hour' type stuff, and they are happy chappies, but they're probably trading too. I often ask myself would you make those comments in person direct to the face of those that they are directed at? It always amazes me why being incognito behind a keyboard enables some people to behave with total lack of civility. I'm not aiming this at you necessarily, and in a fit of pique I have found myself doing similar for which I apologise to all those in receipt.

          "content": "Hello BBB, When Dowgate declare a trade, they do so under the name of Dowgate Group, which is the parent of Dowgate Wealth and Dowgate Capital. So it could be either that is the underlying counterparty, Dowgate Wealth obviously for their own clients (including a trust they run on a contractual basis) or Dowgate Capital who can act on behalf of acquirers of the company, eg if they want to pick up cheap shares below the price they may have to make an offer at to be recommended by Audiobooms board. Both subsidiaries are obviously at arms length from each other due to conflicts, but in this instance I guess it is the Wealth side, primarily for the trust I mentioned (name escapes me at the moment but someone else whose posted on here knows it's name.) I say that because they recently raised capital and what Dowgate will do is buy shares to a target weight they have in their model portfolio for the trust, or indeed if they have gained other Wealth clients, it will be the same, but I doubt it's other clients, as the amounts involved would imply they have taken on some pretty hefty new individual clients recently. They will buy until that target weight is reached in the actual portfolio, and sell if it goes over. This is not trading when 'in the money' it is standard portfolio management practice. So it may seem weird if they buy one day and then sell at a loss the next, that its probably due to the rest of the portfolio dropping in value relative to Audioboom. Dowgate are a long term investor and will not be punting on prospects of a takeover, but on (and I agree 1000% on this) the long term prognosis for the industry and Audiobooms market share within it. The fact that Boom has no debt, will be collecting cash in 2026 due to expiration of onerous contracts and they re gaining traction in the video sphere, and the latter combined with the UK audio podcast market where both have massive amounts of room to increase the ad revenue, since the medium is undercharging given reach, trust with target audience, and in sum, the effectiveness of the advertising to collecting prospective customers. There are a host of other reasons too numerous to go in to here, and many have talked about them already, but Boom is an undervalued share as it sits at the moment in a growth market with a growing trajectory within that market. It is not even overvalued, quite the opposite. What's not too like, and yes the price will rise and fall as it trends upwards, nothing goes up straight, so profit taking will happen, but long term this is a beauty in my book. I know a few micro cap managers who think the same, but don't have the same asset size in their portfolio to become visible to us, via declaration on the RNS front. That's my take, and good luck to all.",

If Audioboom were looking at acquiring another company then I\u2019d assume it  would pay in shares and maybe cash, similar to the Adelicious deal. Therefore there would be a very good chance that Dowgate would be asked to participate in the cash raiding element  in return for AB shares. There would be discussions going on now and thus Dowgate would be allowed to deal in the market due to insider information. It\u2019s all a supposition and for discussion about Cavendish continuing to buy more shares in the market. Hope this clarifies. Good news Cavendish are buying in any event.",

There is nothing wrong with trading, but personally I believe that trading doesn't pay in the long run. Most of the traders on AIM are probably ex-broker market makers, made a few bob in bonuses and then retire, and off to trade on their on account to sustain an income. They do create liquidity which is good for the rest of us, but the nonsense posts are invariably from the trading community who verge on the 'market manipulation' threshold, trying to get less informed through greed and fear to buy and sell on the back of optimistic or disparaging remarks about the company concerned.  However in this case at the moment it is utter rubbish to be disparaging about the outlook for Audioboom. Yes there are sometimes some stupid comments like - 'it's going to \u00a310 in the next 1/2 an hour' type stuff, and they are happy chappies, but they're probably trading too. I often ask myself would you make those comments in person direct to the face of those that they are directed at? It always amazes me why being incognito behind a keyboard enables some people to behave with total lack of civility. I'm not aiming this at you necessarily, and in a fit of pique I have found myself doing similar for which I apologise to all those in receipt. Maybe I'll make it over to play the Aisla some time and meet you in person, after all I live on the east coast, but please for all those reading this post, lets grow up and stop misbehaving like children.",

The Cavendish Note has a fair market value of 3.5x revenue which is circa \u00a313. That is probably about right but could be higher if 2026 forecast has been upped. No release of a new note during SR. And if there is  an interested buyer once the offer is public is could prompt other offers. That\u2019s normal and could raise the offer price. That\u2019s why advisers have been appointed. It\u2019s correct that AB is not an IUP studio. AB is creator business. However it\u2019s not correct that anyone can in practical and economic terms replicate large parts of BOOM\u2019s model internally if they choose. Anything and everything can be replicated I guess. But as far as AB\u2019s business model is concerned: a) it would cost a huge amount of money with a lot of investment risk, b) it would take a significant amount of time, and c)  performance, profit and sustainability (which AB has  achieved) is actually difficult to replicate",

It\u2019s a fair question, but the businesses are not the same, and the market context has changed. >> You appear to have forgotten to put some context to your thoughts on how the market has changed and how you see it? Those companies were bought during a platform land-grab phase (2019\u20132021). Spotify, Amazon and SiriusXM were fighting to own exclusive content, IP and audiences. Profits didn\u2019t matter \u2013 they were buying user lock-in and listening hours. That\u2019s why loss-making podcast studios could sell at huge revenue multiples. >> And in today's market you are eluding to what? I look to the floor and see a dog - i point to the dog and say \"That dog sold for $600 in X market in 2020\" Then a lot of onlookers stood looking at the dog waiting for the next line that never came...?

          "content": "Hello BBB, When Dowgate declare a trade, they do so under the name of Dowgate Group, which is the parent of Dowgate Wealth and Dowgate Capital. So it could be either that is the underlying counterparty, Dowgate Wealth obviously for their own clients (including a trust they run on a contractual basis) or Dowgate Capital who can act on behalf of acquirers of the company, eg if they want to pick up cheap shares below the price they may have to make an offer at to be recommended by Audiobooms board. Both subsidiaries are obviously at arms length from each other due to conflicts, but in this instance I guess it is the Wealth side, primarily for the trust I mentioned (name escapes me at the moment but someone else whose posted on here knows it's name.) I say that because they recently raised capital and what Dowgate will do is buy shares to a target weight they have in their model portfolio for the trust, or indeed if they have gained other Wealth clients, it will be the same, but I doubt it's other clients, as the amounts involved would imply they have taken on some pretty hefty new individual clients recently. They will buy until that target weight is reached in the actual portfolio, and sell if it goes over. This is not trading when 'in the money' it is standard portfolio management practice. So it may seem weird if they buy one day and then sell at a loss the next, that its probably due to the rest of the portfolio dropping in value relative to Audioboom. Dowgate are a long term investor and will not be punting on prospects of a takeover, but on (and I agree 1000% on this) the long term prognosis for the industry and Audiobooms market share within it. The fact that Boom has no debt, will be collecting cash in 2026 due to expiration of onerous contracts and they re gaining traction in the video sphere, and the latter combined with the UK audio podcast market where both have massive amounts of room to increase the ad revenue, since the medium is undercharging given reach, trust with target audience, and in sum, the effectiveness of the advertising to collecting prospective customers. There are a host of other reasons too numerous to go in to here, and many have talked about them already, but Boom is an undervalued share as it sits at the moment in a growth market with a growing trajectory within that market. It is not even overvalued, quite the opposite. What's not too like, and yes the price will rise and fall as it trends upwards, nothing goes up straight, so profit taking will happen, but long term this is a beauty in my book. I know a few micro cap managers who think the same, but don't have the same asset size in their portfolio to become visible to us, via declaration on the RNS front. That's my take, and good luck to all.",

If Audioboom were looking at acquiring another company then I\u2019d assume it  would pay in shares and maybe cash, similar to the Adelicious deal. Therefore there would be a very good chance that Dowgate would be asked to participate in the cash raiding element  in return for AB shares. There would be discussions going on now and thus Dowgate would be allowed to deal in the market due to insider information. It\u2019s all a supposition and for discussion about Cavendish continuing to buy more shares in the market. Hope this clarifies. Good news Cavendish are buying in any event.",

I looked through your past posted and they are balanced and informative. It would be an asset to this board if you could post more frequently. But then of course you\u2019d be classified as part of the \u201chappy\u201d group. What\u2019s your take on Dowgate adding another 9.7k ? They can\u2019t be part of any discussions and perhaps it continues to indicate that at the moment there will be no share issue to fund a potential acquisition?",

There is nothing wrong with trading, but personally I believe that trading doesn't pay in the long run. Most of the traders on AIM are probably ex-broker market makers, made a few bob in bonuses and then retire, and off to trade on their on account to sustain an income. They do create liquidity which is good for the rest of us, but the nonsense posts are invariably from the trading community who verge on the 'market manipulation' threshold, trying to get less informed through greed and fear to buy and sell on the back of optimistic or disparaging remarks about the company concerned.  However in this case at the moment it is utter rubbish to be disparaging about the outlook for Audioboom. Yes there are sometimes some stupid comments like - 'it's going to \u00a310 in the next 1/2 an hour' type stuff, and they are happy chappies, but they're probably trading too. I often ask myself would you make those comments in person direct to the face of those that they are directed at? It always amazes me why being incognito behind a keyboard enables some people to behave with total lack of civility. I'm not aiming this at you necessarily, and in a fit of pique I have found myself doing similar for which I apologise to all those in receipt. Maybe I'll make it over to play the Aisla some time and meet you in person, after all I live on the east coast, but please for all those reading this post, lets grow up and stop misbehaving like children.",

That\u2019s perfectly fine, but constantly presenting it as buying with new money is misleading. I want AUDIOBOOM to do well and I hope the deals they\u2019re making feed through into better numbers. The wider audio market is still moving \u2014 Spotify has recently been focusing on profitability and expanding creator tools and video podcasts rather than chasing expensive exclusives, which shows how the sector has matured. For what it\u2019s worth, if AB does hit \u00a313 I\u2019d be relatively happy, but there\u2019s also a chance the SP could iterate higher over the next couple of years if the business executes well and continues to make astute deals.

It\u2019s a fair question, but the businesses are not the same, and the market context has changed. >> You appear to have forgotten to put some context to your thoughts on how the market has changed and how you see it? Those companies were bought during a platform land-grab phase (2019\u20132021). Spotify, Amazon and SiriusXM were fighting to own exclusive content, IP and audiences. Profits didn\u2019t matter \u2013 they were buying user lock-in and listening hours. That\u2019s why loss-making podcast studios could sell at huge revenue multiples. >> And in today's market you are eluding to what? I look to the floor and see a dog - i point to the dog and say \"That dog sold for $600 in X market in 2020\" Then a lot of onlookers stood looking at the dog waiting for the next line that never came...? Can you make the dog bark?",

And no g\u2019tees they will return in April. There is no sale and the strategic review won\u2019t be worth the paper it\u2019s written on.

          "content": "Hello BBB, When Dowgate declare a trade, they do so under the name of Dowgate Group, which is the parent of Dowgate Wealth and Dowgate Capital. So it could be either that is the underlying counterparty, Dowgate Wealth obviously for their own clients (including a trust they run on a contractual basis) or Dowgate Capital who can act on behalf of acquirers of the company, eg if they want to pick up cheap shares below the price they may have to make an offer at to be recommended by Audiobooms board. Both subsidiaries are obviously at arms length from each other due to conflicts, but in this instance I guess it is the Wealth side, primarily for the trust I mentioned (name escapes me at the moment but someone else whose posted on here knows it's name.) I say that because they recently raised capital and what Dowgate will do is buy shares to a target weight they have in their model portfolio for the trust, or indeed if they have gained other Wealth clients, it will be the same, but I doubt it's other clients, as the amounts involved would imply they have taken on some pretty hefty new individual clients recently. They will buy until that target weight is reached in the actual portfolio, and sell if it goes over. This is not trading when 'in the money' it is standard portfolio management practice. So it may seem weird if they buy one day and then sell at a loss the next, that its probably due to the rest of the portfolio dropping in value relative to Audioboom. Dowgate are a long term investor and will not be punting on prospects of a takeover, but on (and I agree 1000% on this) the long term prognosis for the industry and Audiobooms market share within it. The fact that Boom has no debt, will be collecting cash in 2026 due to expiration of onerous contracts and they re gaining traction in the video sphere, and the latter combined with the UK audio podcast market where both have massive amounts of room to increase the ad revenue, since the medium is undercharging given reach, trust with target audience, and in sum, the effectiveness of the advertising to collecting prospective customers. There are a host of other reasons too numerous to go in to here, and many have talked about them already, but Boom is an undervalued share as it sits at the moment in a growth market with a growing trajectory within that market. It is not even overvalued, quite the opposite. What's not too like, and yes the price will rise and fall as it trends upwards, nothing goes up straight, so profit taking will happen, but long term this is a beauty in my book. I know a few micro cap managers who think the same, but don't have the same asset size in their portfolio to become visible to us, via declaration on the RNS front. That's my take, and good luck to all.",

If Audioboom were looking at acquiring another company then I\u2019d assume it  would pay in shares and maybe cash, similar to the Adelicious deal. Therefore there would be a very good chance that Dowgate would be asked to participate in the cash raiding element  in return for AB shares. There would be discussions going on now and thus Dowgate would be allowed to deal in the market due to insider information. It\u2019s all a supposition and for discussion about Cavendish continuing to buy more shares in the market. Hope this clarifies. Good news Cavendish are buying in any event.",

There is nothing wrong with trading, but personally I believe that trading doesn't pay in the long run. Most of the traders on AIM are probably ex-broker market makers, made a few bob in bonuses and then retire, and off to trade on their on account to sustain an income. They do create liquidity which is good for the rest of us, but the nonsense posts are invariably from the trading community who verge on the 'market manipulation' threshold, trying to get less informed through greed and fear to buy and sell on the back of optimistic or disparaging remarks about the company concerned.  However in this case at the moment it is utter rubbish to be disparaging about the outlook for Audioboom. Yes there are sometimes some stupid comments like - 'it's going to \u00a310 in the next 1/2 an hour' type stuff, and they are happy chappies, but they're probably trading too. I often ask myself would you make those comments in person direct to the face of those that they are directed at? It always amazes me why being incognito behind a keyboard enables some people to behave with total lack of civility. I'm not aiming this at you necessarily, and in a fit of pique I have found myself doing similar for which I apologise to all those in receipt.
