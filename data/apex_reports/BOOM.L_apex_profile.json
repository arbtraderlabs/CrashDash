This represents significant upside opportunity through medium-term value creation in video podcast monetisation and the expansion of the UK podcast market\n\u00b7\nGroup cash at 31 December 2025 of US$4.2 million (31 December 2024: US$3.9 million), with a further US$3.4 million available via an overdraft facility\n\u00b7\nConclusion of the final onerous contract on 31 December 2025, which had been provided for on 30 June 2023, with the Board expecting adjusted EBITDA in 2026 to once again serve as a proxy for cash generation\nKey Q4 2025 and post-period commercial developments\n\u00b7\nLaunch of a commercial partnership with Spotify, which will support the development of Audioboom's video monetisation engine through expanded advertising and subscription opportunities\n\u00b7\nRecord quarterly revenue from our UK operation following the successful integration of Adelicious\n\u00b7\nFurther expansion of the Audioboom Creator Network through a new commercial and distribution partnership with\nHistory Daily\n, an award-winning daily podcast which has been downloaded more than 70 million times since it launched in 2021\nStrategic Review\nThe Strategic Review announced on 3 October remains ongoing, and the Board expects to provide an update on or before the publication of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in April 2026.\nStuart Last, CEO of Audioboom, commented:\n\"2025 marked an inflection point in Audioboom's transition from a podcast network to a scaled audio and video platform. The accretive acquisition of Adelicious in July created instant scale in the UK market and highlights the growth opportunity that exists through disciplined M&A. The additional inventory from the Adelicious network fuelled Showcase, supporting its continued expansion and record revenue contribution.\nVideo growth was also key to this transition, as we developed a market-leading position with 13 of the top 100 Youtube video podcasts in the Audioboom Creator Network. Podscribe's ranker recognised us as the number 1 network for video, and our new commercial partnership with Spotify will support our 2026 focus on enhancing our video revenue engine. It will bring new advertising options as well as direct revenue from subscriptions - this will be a step forward in ensuring we maximise value for our video creators.\nOur financial performance in 2025 was very pleasing, with record revenue and adjusted EBITDA ahead of market expectations for the year. Our gross profit grew at double the pace of revenue, reflecting our continued focus on developing higher-quality revenue. Our increased gross margin combined with our stable operating costs to deliver 54% annual adjusted EBITDA growth - in Q4 our EBITDA margin hit 9%, highlighting the gearing effect of our business model as we drive revenue forward.\nI am excited about 2026. We will have record inventory levels, new international opportunities, and a continued focus on growing our platform model. I would like to express my appreciation to the Audioboom team and to thank shareholders for their continued support and belief in the future of the Company.\"\n1) Financial information for the year ended 31 December 2025 remains subject to audit\n2) Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, share based payments, non-cash foreign exchange movements, material one-off items and onerous contract provisions and losses incurred\nEnquiries\nAudioboom Group PLC\nTel: +44(0)300 303 3765\nStuart Last, Chief Executive Officer\nBrad Clarke, Chief Financial Officer\nJ Goodwin & Co (Financial Advisers to Audioboom)\nTel: +44(0)20 3976 6215\nRupert Hill / Charlie Barnes Yallowley\nRockefeller Capital Management (Financial Advisers to Audioboom)\nTel: +1 212-549-5341\nWilliam B.
