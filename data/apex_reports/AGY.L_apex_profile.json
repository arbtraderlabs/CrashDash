The first half of the year saw growth driven by improved operational execution and the restoration of reliability across our supply chain. December's regulatory approval in Germany for our subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy, Grass MATA MPL or Grassmuno\u00ae, represents a pivotal moment for the Group. This approval is particularly significant as the German allergen ordinance TAV process concludes later this year, leading to the market removal of competitor products that did not meet regulatory requirements.\n\"Our new product in Germany, which is our largest market, offers meaningful brand differentiation for patients and allows us to address the largest segment of the immunotherapy market. This approval also marks an important first step towards expanding our reach into other major global markets. Additionally, the interim analyses from our VLP Peanut program, investigating our next-generation peanut allergy immunotherapy candidate, continue to be encouraging, reinforcing our confidence in its potential. Together, the significant achievements of 2025 and our ongoing development programs position us well to execute our strategy and build sustainable value for the Group and shareholders.\"\nPeter Jensen, Chairman of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"By maintaining our sharp focus on priority R&D programmes, Allergy Therapeutics is making significant strides in our commitment to transforming patient care in allergy treatment. The regulatory approval in Germany of Grass MATA MPL was a significant milestone, and our comprehensive development strategy for this immunotherapy continues to advance, with a paediatric trial progressing on track. Subject to successful completion, this trial would support label expansion to include children, thereby enhancing the value of this important new product. Furthermore, achieving registration in Germany has proven that we now have a clinical trial methodology that, after many years of refinement, can be used as our standard for clinical trials on other indications, such as birch, ragweed, and others covering the most significant pollen allergy segments.\"\n*Constant currency uses prior year weighted average exchange rates to translate current year foreign currency denominated revenue to give a year-on-year comparison excluding the effects of foreign exchange movements\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulations.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash/Giles Balleny/Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott/David Daley/Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio.\nDuring the period, the Group received marketing\nauthorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\n\u00ae\n, the first subcutaneous grass\npollen immunotherapy approved under\nthe\nTAV programme.\nCommercialisation\ncommenced in January 2026\nand\nsales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed\nthose achieved\nin the\nyear\nended 30 June 2025.\nThe\nGroup's\ncash balance as\nat\n31 December 2025 was\n\u00a310.1 million\n(30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced,\nduring the period\nthe Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants\n,\ngenerating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million.\nThese\nproceeds\nwere applied\nto repay all\noutstanding\nfinancial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly\nreducing the Group's\nlevel of debt\nand\nstrengthening the balance sheet.\nIn addition, the\nShareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn\nas at 31 December 2025.\nTogether with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nThe Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"We enter 2026 with strong momentum across all aspects of our business. The first half of the year saw growth driven by improved operational execution and the restoration of reliability across our supply chain. December's regulatory approval in Germany for our subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy, Grass MATA MPL or Grassmuno\u00ae, represents a pivotal moment for the Group. This approval is particularly significant as the German allergen ordinance TAV process concludes later this year, leading to the market removal of competitor products that did not meet regulatory requirements.\n\"Our new product in Germany, which is our largest market, offers meaningful brand differentiation for patients and allows us to address the largest segment of the immunotherapy market. This approval also marks an important first step towards expanding our reach into other major global markets. Additionally, the interim analyses from our VLP Peanut program, investigating our next-generation peanut allergy immunotherapy candidate, continue to be encouraging, reinforcing our confidence in its potential. Together, the significant achievements of 2025 and our ongoing development programs position us well to execute our strategy and build sustainable value for the Group and shareholders.\"\nPeter Jensen, Chairman of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"By maintaining our sharp focus on priority R&D programmes, Allergy Therapeutics is making significant strides in our commitment to transforming patient care in allergy treatment. The regulatory approval in Germany of Grass MATA MPL was a significant milestone, and our comprehensive development strategy for this immunotherapy continues to advance, with a paediatric trial progressing on track. Subject to successful completion, this trial would support label expansion to include children, thereby enhancing the value of this important new product. Furthermore, a",

It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic symptoms in adults caused by pollen from grasses (hay fever), such as running nose (rhinitis), allergic conjunctivitis (rhinoconjunctivitis), without asthma or with asthma that is well controlled. Treatment is administered before the grass-pollen season as a six-injection pre-seasonal course.\nThe approval marks the first subcutaneous grass-pollen immunotherapy to be authorised by the PEI through its TAV (Therapieallergene-Verordnung) framework and follows the submission of a comprehensive evidence package of quality, safety and clinical efficacy including the Group's pivotal Phase III G306 trial in adults. In that trial, the immunotherapy demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in the Combined Symptom & Medication Score (CSMS) compared to placebo over the peak pollen season.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, said:\n\"The regulatory approval of this state-of-the-art short-course aluminium-free immunotherapy is a defining moment for Allergy Therapeutics and for the future of allergy immunotherapy in Germany. Grass pollen, a common cause of seasonal allergy, significantly impacts the lives of many people and new treatment options are desperately needed. Grassmuno offers an effective, convenient treatment option for people living with a grass-pollen allergy, and its authorisation under the TAV regulation validates our clinical excellence and commitment to quality. It also validates our MATA MPL platform concept and establishes a strong foundation for our future expansion strategy for this innovative and disruptive immunotherapy with allergens such as birch and ragweed across other major global markets.\"\nGrass pollen is a key segment within the German seasonal allergy market, which is projected to reach ~US$1 billion by 20301.\nGrassmuno\nis expected to be a major driver of the Group's business in Germany, its largest market, as a regulatory-approved, short-course treatment approach that can be completed before the allergy season begins. This offers the potential for people living with a grass pollen allergy to achieve protection without the burden of months-long treatment schedules.\nIn November 2024 the Group commenced a\nPhase III trial\n(G308) to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of Grass MATA MPL in a paediatric population. That trial is the first long-term SCIT trial in a paediatric population and complements Allergy Therapeutics' previous studies in adults, furthering its comprehensive development strategy for the immunotherapy across different age groups.\nAllergy Therapeutics continues to explore the potential for additional registration opportunities in other major global markets, following engagement with authorities regarding local regulatory requirements.\n- ENDS -\nReferences\n1.\nInternal company projections\nAbout Grass MATA MPL\nGrass MATA MPL is a subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy to treat moderate to severe allergic symptoms in adults caused by pollen from grasses, such as running nose (rhinitis), allergic conjunctivitis (rhinoconjunctivitis), without asthma or with asthma that is well controlled.

This will allow a full analysis of the short-term safety and efficacy results of the G308 study in Q4 2026, with short-term safety data from the first year expected to be announced in Q4 2025. Patients selected for the long-term extension will progress to a further three years of active treatment or placebo. This will be followed by two years of treatment-free follow-up, after which the long-term primary efficacy & safety will be evaluated.\nThe G308 study has been designed to ensure that only a minority of patients will receive long-term treatment of placebo (~8-13% probability), which is an important improvement from the EMA standard design (50% probability) and will enable the majority of paediatric patients to receive long-term active treatment.\nManuel Llobet, CEO of Allergy Therapeutics,\u00a0commented:\n\"\nThe commencement of screening in the second year of our Phase III G308 trial builds upon our commitment to addressing the unmet needs of the paediatric population in grass allergy. Overall we have invested over $100M in clinical development in grass allergy to date and combined with our successful adult trials, this long-term trial will help us in our aim to provide children affected by grass allergies with an alternative treatment journey that is less burdensome compared to taking tablets daily.\"\n- ENDS -\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

This is achieved by disguising the major peanut allergen (Ara h2) on the surface of the nanoparticle used in the vaccine candidate, reducing its allergenicity and inducing a favourable pro-tolerogenic immune response.\nIn earlier stages of the trial, as previously announced, peanut allergic patients treated with ascending concentrations of the vaccine candidate showed a marked reduction in wheal size versus placebo using a whole peanut extract skin prick test. The study subsequently progressed to include both healthy volunteers and peanut allergic patients who were dosed subcutaneously with further ascending concentrations of VLP Peanut, aiming to determine the maximum tolerated dose.\nHealthy cohorts have now completed dosing at the maximum intended levels, with no dose-limiting safety or tolerability signals observed. One final cohort of peanut allergic patients remains, with dosing expected to extend beyond the candidate's anticipated therapeutic range. This final stage of the trial is progressing as planned, with safety and tolerability data to date continuing to support the candidate's positive profile.\nA total of 48 subjects have been enrolled and investigated during the trial.\nEarlier\ninterim analysis\nfrom the first two cohorts of peanut allergic patients, suggested that VLP Peanut is driving a reduction in allergic response to the major peanut allergen (Ara h2):\n\u00b7\nA protective dose-dependent inhibition of Ara h2 IgE binding to B cells was observed after treatment with VLP Peanut compared to placebo. This inhibitory effect is indicative of how VLP Peanut induces blocking antibodies that may reduce the pro-allergic response.\n\u00b7\nA trend towards a reduction of both basophil sensitivity and basophil reactivity to Ara h2 was seen, especially for the higher VLP Peanut dose, and an induction of protective specific IgG towards the major peanut allergen Ara h2 was observed compared to placebo.\nFindings from the PROTECT trial will guide dose selection for the Group's planned Phase IIb trial which is expected to commence in H2 2026.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"These results signal a major advance in the allergy research community's search for what remains our holy grail - an effective short-course vaccine for people living with peanut allergy. This vaccine candidate's positive safety profile, together with encouraging early efficacy signals showing a strong immune response and reduced allergic reactivity, further strengthen our confidence in the programme and its potential to transform the lives of those affected by this most common and severe food allergy. We look forward to progressing VLP Peanut, the most advanced peanut vaccine programme in the industry, into Phase IIb development and continuing to lead the way in allergy innovation.\"\nMore information about the PROTECT trial can be found on\nClinicalTrials.gov\nunder the identifier\nNCT05476497\n.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulations.\n- ENDS -\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure dise",

Allergy is the official journal of EAACI with an impact factor of 12.6, the highest-impact journal in the field of allergy and clinical immunology.\nGrass MATA MPL is an aluminium-free, pre-seasonal short-course immunotherapy designed to address the cause of symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen, using six injections given prior to the grass allergy season. A Marketing Authorisation Application to the Paul Ehrlich Institut in Germany is currently under review, following the Group's submission in November 2024. Should this result in regulatory approval, commercial launch of the product is anticipated in FY2026.\nResults from Allergy Therapeutics' G306 Phase III trial, which completed in\nNovember 2023\n, have been\npublished\nby Zielen\net al\n., showing that Grass MATA MPL met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant reduction in the Combined Symptom & Medication Score (CSMS) of 20.3% (p=0.0005) compared to placebo over the peak pollen season.\nFurthermore, a meta-analysis of the two Phase III trials in the Grass MATA MPL programme (G306 and G309) has also been\npublished\nby Zielen\net al\n., whereby 674 adult subjects with allergic rhinitis and/or rhino-conjunctivitis were included. The results of this meta-analysis showed a similar statistically significant improvement of 22.5% (\np\n=0.00004) compared to placebo on the primary endpoint CSMS over the peak grass pollen season.\nMost recently, Pfaar\net al\n., have\npublished\na paper justifying that primary CSMS outcome improvements exceeding 16% are clinically relevant, confirming that Grass MATA MPL achieved levels of clinical relevance both in the G306 trial and the meta-analysis. In this publication, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for allergy immunotherapy trials was assessed using direct patient feedback and an anchor-based method using a data driven approach. The MCID is a level that represents the smallest change in CSMS that is perceived to be clinically important and meaningful or noticeable for a patient.\nIn a survey of 1071 grass allergic patients, the majority of participants (69%) considered a 1-point improvement (e.g., from \"moderate\" to \"mild\", or \"severe\" to \"moderate\") in their single most severe allergy symptom as clinically relevant. Furthermore, based on an anchor-based approach using the rhinitis quality-of-life questionnaire, an MCID of 16% and 0.22 points were justified as relative and absolute CSMS differences, respectively.\nTaken together, these three papers complete the publication cycle for the adult-phase of the clinical programme evaluating Grass MATA MPL. The Group's G308 long-term paediatric study evaluating Grass MATA MPL in a paediatric population is ongoing, and the first cohort of grass allergic patients has completed their first grass pollen season.\nProfessor Stefan Zielen a.D., lead author from Goethe University Frankfurt and Institute of Respiratory Research, Medaimun GmbH Frankfurt am Main, Germany, said:\n\"In Germany there is a significant unmet need for allergen immunotherapy products that directly address the cause of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen, and the excellent data seen throughout the Grass MATA MPL clinical trial programme support the use of a short-course subcutaneous immunotherapy to potentially fill this gap.\"\nProfessor Oliver Pfaar, lead author from the University Hospital, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg, Germany said:\n\"As Chair of the EAACI task force, 'Minimal Clinically Important Differenc",

With our near-term opportunities to significantly strengthen our commercial portfolio and to deliver clinical data within our pipeline of next-generation allergy immunotherapies, the Board remains confident in the Group's trading prospects, underpinned by a commitment to improve the lives of people living with allergies.\"\nFinancials\nSubject to audit, revenue for H2 is expected to be \u00a321.0 million (H2 2024: \u00a321.6 million), reflecting an earlier than expected impact of the approaching change in the German regulatory landscape, as the end of the TAV transition period is reached in 2026. This is expected to result in unregistered allergy treatments being withdrawn from the market and a shift to fully licensed products.\nRevenue for the year ended 30\u00a0June 2025 is expected to be broadly flat at \u00a355.0\u00a0million (2024: \u00a355.2\u00a0million) based on actual foreign currency rates. However, on a constant currency basis* revenue is expected to have grown over 2%, with revenue in Germany flat due to the reasons mentioned above and strong growth in the Group's second largest market, Spain, of 11%.\nContinuing cost controls operated during the year have managed the cost base of the Group whilst enabling selective investment in strategic growth related projects.\nThe unaudited cash balance at 30\u00a0June 2025 was \u00a312.8 million (30\u00a0June 2024: \u00a312.9\u00a0million) after drawing down \u00a315.0\u00a0million during the year (net of repayments) from the Shareholder Loan Facility with major shareholders, SkyGem Acquisition Limited (an affiliate of ZQ Capital Management Limited) and Southern Fox Investments Limited, and \u00a320.0 million from the Hayfin Facility, the secured senior loan facility with\u00a0Hayfin Healthcare Opportunities LuxCo S.a.r.l., a fund advised by Hayfin Capital Management LLP.\nCommercial\nThe Group is well placed to benefit from the changing regulatory environment in Germany by leveraging its existing registered product portfolio. The Company has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application to the Paul Ehrlich Institut in Germany for Grass MATA MPL - a new, short-course subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy (SCIT) that aims to address the cause of symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen. Should this result in a regulatory approval, the Company expects to launch the product in FY2026.\nConfidence in prospects for the German market are underpinned by recent trends in order intake and sales of first-year (patient initiation) treatments. A continued decline in orders for the Group's unregistered Pollinex Quattro product in the last two months of the financial year were more than offset by increased orders for its registered Grass, Trees and Venomil products, as order intake in Germany for the Group's own-manufactured vaccines grew double digit overall (in terms of units) vs the same two-month period in the previous year. Further, the vast majority of growth in the Group's registered products during FY25 results from sales of first-year treatments - a lead indicator for future growth as first-year patients become maintenance patients in years 2 and 3 of the treatment cycle.\nPipeline\nProgression of the Group's Grass MATA MPL MAA in Germany remains on track and preparations are well underway for the product's commercial launch, should the MAA result in a regulatory approval.\nThe\u00a0Phase III G308 trial to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of that product candidate in paediatr",

Meanwhile, the third of four planned cohorts of peanut-allergic patients\nis progressing through dose escalation\n, also including levels beyond the anticipated therapeutic range. These data will supplement previously\nreported\nbiomarker efficacy findings observed at lower cumulative doses, strengthening the understanding of treatment response at higher doses.\nResults from the current patient cohort will also be key in defining the optimal dose range for the upcoming Phase IIb study while reinforcing confidence in the treatment's safety profile. Both healthy volunteers and peanut-allergic patients have progressed through their\ninitial dose escalation\n, and, following a safety review, the committee has recommended advancing to the second of three planned dose increases for each cohort.\nIn addition, Allergy Therapeutics announces the publication of a\nnew paper\nin the\nJournal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JACI)\n, which evaluates the beneficial tolerogenic properties and immunological reactivity of VLP Peanut.\nPeanut allergy remains a growing public health concern, particularly in the US and Europe, with limited effective treatment options. Results detailed in the paper, from earlier research conducted by Allergy Therapeutics, demonstrate that VLP Peanut can reduce allergic responses while promoting protective immune mechanisms in cells from peanut-allergic individuals. Preliminary skin testing in six peanut-allergic adults further confirmed the vaccine candidate was safe and well tolerated.\nThe PROTECT trial continues to progress to plan and the Company expects to announce the initial topline data later this summer.\nProfessor Mohamed Shamji, Professor of Immunology and Allergy at Imperial College London and senior author of the paper, commented: \"\nThere remains an urgent and compelling need for a therapy that not only ensures sustained protection during extended treatment-free periods but also holds the promise of curing peanut allergies. Our dedicated efforts are aimed at fulfilling this significant unmet need, and the data we have collected thus far are exceptionally promising. We have established that the vaccine not only circumvents triggering allergic reactions but also skilfully modulates the immune system, potentially leading to long-term protection. This marks a significant advancement in food allergy therapeutics, and the findings from the clinical trial phase set the stage for new therapies for peanut allergy.\n''\nMore information about the PROTECT trial can be found on\nClinicalTrials.gov\nunder the identifier\nNCT05476497\n.\n- ENDS -\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker / Rory Sale\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nTamar Cranford Smith - Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

The resolution to approve implementation of the awards was approved by 99.7% of votes cast.\nNew LTIP Awards\nThe New LTIP Awards are intended to incentivise and reward a defined level of share price growth and shareholder value creation over a five-year period, as the Company seeks to accelerate the delivery and sales of its immunotherapies. The remuneration committee of the Company believes that the mix of remuneration awards will ensure a balance between strong share price growth and reaching for full operational, commercial and financial potential.\nThe maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares under option pursuant to the New LTIP Awards is approximately 208 million, representing 4.4% of the Company's issued share capital.\nThe New LTIP Awards have been made in the form of nominal cost options under the 2023 Long Term Share Incentive Plan.

The trial's results supported the recent\nsubmission\nof a Marketing Authorisation Application to the Paul Ehrlich Institut in Germany.\nGrass MATA MPL is an aluminium-free, pre-seasonal short-course immunotherapy designed to address the cause of symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen, using just six injections prior to the grass allergy season.\nThe publication includes new mechanistic insights into Grass MATA MPL's mode of action, supplementing the previously reported positive efficacy and safety data:\n\u00b7\nThe study reveals how Grass MATA MPL works at a molecular level, showing it triggers multiple protective immune responses through the induction of both IgG4 and IgA (specifically IgA1 and IgA2) antibodies - a more comprehensive immunological effect than seen with other allergy treatments.\n\u00b7\nNewly published comparative analysis reveals that no other subcutaneous immunotherapy for respiratory allergies has achieved greater than 14% efficacy improvement in Phase III trials over the past decade - highlighting the significance of Grass MATA MPL's\npreviously reported\n20.3% improvement over placebo.\n\u00b7\nPatients reported significantly better rhinitis quality of life while using Grass MATA MPL, with a 27.7% improvement compared to placebo - notably higher than achieved with other grass immunotherapy products.\n\u00b7\nThe publication provides new context showing how Grass MATA MPL's six-injection format, which achieved >95% trial completion, contrasts favourably with traditional immunotherapy treatments requiring up to 100 injections or daily tablets over several years with higher discontinuation rates.\nProfessor Stefan Zielen, lead author and Principal Investigator from Goethe University, Frankfurt, said:\n\"These comprehensive findings represent an important advance in allergy immunotherapy research. The data demonstrate that Grass MATA MPL stimulates a broader protective immune response than we typically see, activating multiple antibody pathways that help reduce allergic reactions. This deeper understanding of the treatment candidate's mode of action helps explain the strong efficacy we observed in the Phase III trial and, importantly, the significant improvements patients reported in their daily lives.\"\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"The publication of our G306 data in Allergy, one of the world's leading allergy journals, provides important validation of our innovative approach to allergy immunotherapy. These results reinforce our confidence in Grass MATA MPL's potential to provide an important new treatment option for patients affected by seasonal grass allergy.\"\n- ENDS -\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker / Rory Sale\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nTamar Cranford Smith - Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

Revenue is now expected to have grown for two consecutive half year periods, when compared to the equivalent periods in the prior financial year, as the Group's financial recovery continues.

This inhibitory effect is indicative of how VLP Peanut induces blocking antibodies that may reduce the pro-allergic response.\n\u00b7\nA trend towards a reduction of both basophil sensitivity and basophil reactivity to Ara h2 was seen, especially for the higher VLP Peanut dose, and an induction of protective specific IgG towards the major peanut allergen Ara h2 was observed compared to placebo.\nThis interim analysis stage involved 12 peanut allergic patients across three treatment groups. The data represents the first demonstration of an immunologic response using a nanoparticle-based approach in peanut allergic patients. Following administration of initial escalating doses, patients underwent comprehensive assessment including skin-prick testing with whole peanut extract and blood sampling to identify key biomarkers of efficacy. As previously\ncommunicated\n, no relevant safety signals have been observed to date.\nProf. Mohamed Shamji, Imperial College London, commented:\n\"Peanut allergy affects around 3% of the worldwide population and there remain gaps in current therapeutic options. Novel therapeutics are needed and the interim findings from the PROTECT study demonstrate a desirable clinical immunologic response. This includes a reduction in skin reactivity and basophil responsiveness in peanut allergic patients and a dose-dependent induction of IgG antibodies with inhibitory activity of IgE binding to B-Cells. Taken together, these findings support the modulation of the peanut induced allergic response and supports VLP Peanut being potentially effective and safe as a novel therapeutic for peanut allergy\n.''\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"These initial efficacy results mark an important milestone for our peanut allergy programme. The consistency in immunological response seen at these early doses is particularly encouraging. Combined with the positive safety profile, this data supports our plans to progress to higher doses in the remaining cohorts as we work towards identifying an optimal therapeutic dose for phase II development.\"\nMore information about the PROTECT trial can be found on\nClinicalTrials.gov\nunder the identifier\nNCT05476497\n.\n- ENDS -\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker / Rory Sale\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nTamar Cranford Smith - Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

The 2024 Accounts and Notice of Annual General Meeting have been posted to shareholders of the Company (the \"\nShareholders\n\") today and are available to view on, and download from, the Company's website at\nhttps://www.allergytherapeutics.com/investors/shareholder-services/agm-information/\n.\nIn addition to the routine business matters to be proposed to Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the Board will be proposing resolutions in relation to the following:\nApproval of Special Awards\nThe Company is seeking approval from the Shareholders to authorise the Directors to finalise and implement arrangements for the grant of the special, out of cycle, long term incentive awards to the Company's senior executive team (the \"\nLTIP Awards\n\") and additional option awards to the Company's employees (the \"\nOption Awards\n\" and, together with the LTIP Awards, the \"\nSpecial Awards\n\").\nThe LTIP Awards are intended to incentivise and reward extraordinary levels of share price growth and shareholder value creation over a five-year period, as more patients benefit from the Company's immunotherapies. The remuneration committee of the Company believes that the mix of remuneration awards will ensure a balance between strong growth and reaching for full potential.\nIn order to make the Special Awards, the Company needs to make certain amendments to its 2023 Long Term Share Incentive Plan (the \"\nPlan\n\") and to adopt a sub-plan to the Plan. No amendments will be made to the overall Plan limit. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares under option pursuant to the LTIP Awards will be approximately 215 million, representing 4.5% of the Company's issued share capital as at 14 November 2024. The Company anticipates that the Option Awards will in aggregate be granted over a maximum of 1.7% of the Company's issued share capital as at 14 November 2024.\nOff-market Purchase of Deferred Shares\nThe Company's share capital includes 9,848,333 deferred shares of 0.1 pence each (the \"\nDeferred Shares\n\"). The Deferred Shares carry very limited rights and have no economic value and the Board can see no reason for the Deferred Shares to remain in issue. The Company's articles of association provide that the Deferred Shares can be acquired for a nominal sum of not more than \u00a31. Therefore the Board recommends that the Deferred Shares be purchased by the Company as an off-market transaction and cancelled pursuant to the terms of a repurchase contract (the \"\nDeferred Shares Repurchase Contract\n\").\nPursuant to Companies Act 2006, the Company may repurchase the Deferred Shares as part of an off-market transaction pursuant to a contract approved by the Shareholders. The Company is therefore seeking the approval of the Shareholders of the form of the Deferred Shares Repurchase Contract. The Company is subject to a covenant under its secured loan facility with Hayfin Healthcare Opportunities LuxCo S.a.r.l. (\"\nHayfin\n\") which restricts the Company from repurchasing its share capital or resolving to do so. In light of such restriction, the passing of the resolution is subject to the Company receiving written consent from Hayfin with respect to the purchase of the Deferred Shares.\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker / Rory Sale\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nTamar Cranford Smith - Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapy vaccines that have the potential to cure disease.

In\u00a0that trial, Grass MATA MPL demonstrated a highly statistically significant reduction in\u00a0the\u00a0Combined Symptom & Medication Score (CSMS) compared to placebo over the peak pollen season. Building on these positive results, G308 is designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the immunotherapy candidate in a paediatric population over five years.\nTopline safety and efficacy data are expected in Q4 2025.\nThe G308 paediatric trial complements Allergy Therapeutics' previous studies in adults, including the pivotal Phase III G306 trial and the exploratory G309 field study, furthering the Group's comprehensive development strategy for Grass MATA MPL across different age groups.\nManuel Llobet, CEO of Allergy Therapeutics,\u00a0commented:\n\"\nThe commencement of our long-term paediatric Phase III trial (G308) marks the first time a SCIT grass pollen vaccine has been evaluated in a paediatric population over the long-term, a significant milestone in the allergy industry. Encouraged by the results of our short-course grass pollen immunotherapy in both the successful G309 exploratory field trial and the pivotal G306 trial, we are excited to advance the development of this innovative treatment candidate in new patient populations, potentially offering a transformative option for children with grass pollen allergies.\"\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker / Rory Sale\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nTamar Cranford Smith - Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Consilium\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@consilium-comms.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapy vaccines that have the potential to cure disease.

The allergoid is adsorbed to microcrystalline tyrosine as a depot adjuvant system formulation. Monophosphoryl lipid-A (MPL), is included as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the immunotherapy and to enhance the switch from an allergen specific helper T-cell Type 2 (Th2) to helper T-cell Type 1 (Th1) like immune response.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

No relevant safety or tolerability issues were observed at these higher doses.\nAs announced in June 2024, healthy subjects in the PROTECT trial have now received a 400-fold dose increase of VLP Peanut, providing strong confidence that the VLP technology within the vaccine candidate is safe and well tolerated at high cumulative doses.\nAs a result of these positive safety outcomes, the trial's external safety review committee has agreed that the doses administered so far have been safe and well tolerated. Based on this assessment, the committee has approved the progression to higher doses in cohort 3 for peanut allergic patients and cohort 4 for healthy volunteers. Final cohorts 3 and 4 are on schedule to complete dosing in H1 2025.\nThe ongoing Phase I/IIa VLP Peanut PROTECT trial is evaluating the maximum safe and tolerated dose of the Group's peanut allergy vaccine candidate and includes assessment of biomarker efficacy in peanut allergic patients. Blood samples taken from peanut allergic study volunteers before and after dosing in the first two cohorts are being analysed to identify key biomarker changes indicative of efficacy.\nThe preliminary results from the first two cohorts of peanut allergic patients assessing safety and efficacy are expected in Q4 2024.\nBlood samples taken from peanut allergic study volunteers before and after dosing in cohorts 1 and 2 are being analysed to identify key biomarker changes indicative of efficacy. Basophil activation testing (BAT) mimics an allergic reaction by stimulating basophils with peanut allergens and then observing the expression of activation markers on the surface of the basophils. A reduction in the expression of those markers in the volunteers' samples would be indicative of efficacy in the VLP Peanut vaccine candidate. The preliminary results from the first two cohorts of peanut allergic patients are expected in Q4 2024.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"We are very grateful to both the trial participants and our partner clinicians for helping Allergy Therapeutics progress VLP Peanut through the clinic. Peanut allergy remains a disease of high unmet need and patients and their families are eager to see progress towards solutions. The data gathered through the PROTECT trial continues to be encouraging, as is the safety review committee's decision to proceed with higher doses in subsequent cohorts. We are keen to present preliminary efficacy data based upon biomarkers by the end of this year.\"\nMore information about the PROTECT trial can be found on\nClinicalTrials.gov\nunder the identifier\nNCT05476497\n.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker / Rory Sale\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\nTamar Cranford Smith - Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Consilium\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@consilium-comms.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapy vaccines that have the potential to cure disease.

The operating loss pre-R&D is expected to be lower than the prior year.\nThe unaudited cash balance at 30\u00a0June 2024 was \u00a312.9\u00a0million (30\u00a0June 2023: \u00a314.8\u00a0million) after drawing down \u00a322.5\u00a0million from the amended loan facility.\nThe Group expects that additional funding will be required from around late August onwards for trading, working capital, capital expenditure and continuing research and development programmes. The major shareholders have provided sustained funding to the Group over the last 18 months, most recently via the participation in the uncommitted \u00a340m loan facility established in December 2023 of which \u00a322.5m has been drawn leaving \u00a317.5m remaining.

No unexpected safety events were observed with Grass MATA MPL 27,600 SU.\nPositive regulatory discussions were held with the PEI early in 2024 regarding the results of the pivotal G306 Phase III trial, as well as the data in support of CMC requirements and the subsequent regulatory pathway to national registration. During these meetings, key trial data from the pivotal G306 Phase III trial were shared, alongside supporting CMC data that the Group plans t",

This is essential for further clinical development of VLP Peanut as the external safety review committee agreed that the doses administered so far have been safe and well tolerated and dose increments in next cohorts can proceed as planned to similarly high doses in peanut allergic patients and to establish the dose range to be considered for the upcoming Phase IIb study.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"The promising safety and tolerability data from the latest cohorts in the PROTECT trial of our peanut allergy vaccine candidate are welcomed, providing a solid basis for the design of our upcoming Phase IIb study.

Feedback was constructive and PEI confirmed that, subject to the usual regulatory approval procedures and detailed data analysis, the Group may proceed with an MAA. As previously announced, the Group intends to submit an MAA in Q4 2024.\nSupportive of US strategy\nCompletion of the G309 and G306 field studies represents a significant milestone in plans for registration in the US. Following an earlier successful end of phase 2 meeting with FDA, the subsequent studies were designed to support a pathway forward to BLA in the US with both G309 and G306 studies including US subjects\nand it is also planned to include US subjects in the upcoming paediatric study G308\n. As previously communicated, a specific requirement for FDA, will involve a further study known as G307 to meet the required total number of US subjects treated using the product intended for registration and the Group are planning for meetings with the FDA to agree a route forward. Immediate focus will be preparing the data package for national MAA in Q4 alongside exploration for potential collaborations for US expansion.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"\nWe appreciate the supportive and helpful discussions with the PEI and are very pleased that preparations for the regulatory submission of our Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy candidate remain on track.\nBringing Grass MATA MPL to this stage has been a huge undertaking for a company like us.

This ongoing trial progressed in March 2024 to subcutaneous dosing of peanut allergic patients, marking the start of the clinical proof of concept phase using biomarkers to assess preliminary efficacy.\nAllergy Therapeutics will also be hosting a symposium,\n\"Setting a new standard for grass subcutaneous immunotherapy,\"\non Sunday, 2 June, 13:45-14:45 CEST, chaired by Professor Dr. Stefan Zielen, Head of the Institute for Respiratory Medicine, Frankfurt, Germany. The symposium will include presentations covering regulatory and clinical challenges in allergen immunotherapy trials, as well as results from the Group's pivotal Phase III G306 trial of Grass MATA MPL by key experts from the US and EU.\nIn addition, Prof. Mohamed Shamji from Imperial College, London and EAACI Vice President Congresses, will showcase the Group's scientific adaptive approaches to clinical development, as applied in the successful G309\nand\nG306\nstudies, as examples of current state-of-the-art clinical development in a plenary session.\nFinally, Prof. Shamji will host an embargo session at the closure day of the EAACI conference to release the Group's recently accepted VLP Peanut paper in the peer reviewed\nJournal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology\n, the official publication of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI). This session will highlight the promising biomarker safety and efficacy profile of VLP Peanut, including the first clinical results supporting the hypo-allergic profile of VLP Peanut based on the skin test results from the PROTECT Phase I/IIa study.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer at Allergy Therapeutics, said:\n\"At Allergy Therapeutics, our mission is to transform lives by breaking new ground in immunology treatments, and we are thrilled to have such a robust presence at this year's EAACI Congress. The research we are sharing demonstrates the strength of our science and, with one innovative short-course allergy immunotherapy targeting peanut allergy currently in the clinic and another targeting grass pollen allergy progressing towards a planned market authorisation application, we are steadfast in our commitment to helping patients change the way they think about their allergies and better manage their conditions.\"\nThe complete list of Allergy Therapeutics-sponsored abstracts accepted by EAACI for presentation are available on the Group's website.\nNo new material price sensitive information is expected to be disclosed on Allergy Therapeutics at the EAACI Congress 2024.\nAllergy Therapeutics' Symposium\nSetting a new standard for grass subcutaneous immunotherapy\nSunday, 02 June; 13:45-14:45 (CEST)\nIntroduction\nChair: Professor Dr. Stefan Zielen, Head of the Institute for Respiratory Medicine, Frankfurt, Germany\nWelcome and introduction\nSpeaker\nProfessor Dr. med.

The key findings from this evaluation are as follows:\n\u00b7\nThe primary endpoint of the trial, \"\nCombined Symptom & Medication Score (\nCSMS) averaged over the peak pollen season\", demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of 20.3% (p=0.00024) for Grass MATA MPL compared to placebo, providing evidence of a substantial reduction in daily symptoms and use of relief medication among participants receiving Grass MATA MPL\n\u00b7\nA highly statistically significant improvement in the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) (p=0.0003) was observed during the peak season\n\u00b7\nThe protective biomarker immunoglobulin (IgG4), measured during the grass pollen season, showed a large increase of approximately five-fold after treatment with Grass MATA MPL compared to placebo which achieved high statistical significance (p\n\u00b7\n555 subjects with allergic conjunctivitis and/or rhinitis were randomised and 528 (95%) completed all six injections of Grass MATA MPL or placebo. Demographics, allergic history and immunoglobulins were generally well-balanced at baseline between the Grass MATA MPL and placebo groups. In total, 278 and 277 patients received Grass MATA MPL and placebo, respectively.\nAs previously communicated, the treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals. Further exploratory endpoint analyses (including an extensive biomarker evaluation) of the G306 trial are now underway. Full results, including secondary and exploratory endpoints, will be presented at the upcoming European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology conference in June 2024 and submitted for peer-reviewed publication later this year. The Group's preparation for the marketing authorisation application (MAA) is well underway, with a planned submission in Q4 2024.\nManuel Llobet, CEO at Allergy Therapeutics, stated:\n\"\nThe findings announced today further demonstrate the beneficial treatment effect of our Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy candidate. Grass pollen, a common cause of seasonal allergy, significantly impacts the lives of many people, necessitating the development of new treatment options.\n\"The results of our G306 study, alongside the results of our earlier G309 exploratory field study, provide a strong and consistent data package for progression to an MAA submission. This affords us the potential to provide a unique offering to the market as the only Grass SCIT product registered through the TAV programme in Germany. I would like to express my gratitude to our team at Allergy Therapeutics and our partners at multiple trial sites and countries for their exceptional work and dedication to this trial.

We have navigated the challenges of last year, resulting in more streamlined operations and improved cost-effectiveness. This progress starts to pave the way towards a return to growth.\nThe successful completion of the pivotal Phase III G306 trial for Grass MATA MPL, meeting its primary endpoint, and the continuous clinical advancements in our VLP Peanut R&D programme, are a testament to our innovative capabilities. The progress in the development of these two treatments reaffirms the purpose of our work, to transform the lives of people with allergies and those around them.\nNone of this could have been achieved without the resilience, commitment, and passion of our R&D team, all employees across the Group and our Board. I am proud of the progress the Company has made in a difficult year.\nFinally, thank you to our shareholders who have remained supportive of the Company throughout the period, including in the Equity Financing completed in October.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the six months ended 31 December 2023 was \u00a333.6m (2023 H1: \u00a339.9m) representing a reduction of 16% on a reported and constant currency basis. This decrease in revenue is due to the previously reported manufacturing capacity that needed to be allocated to investigational medicinal product batches for use in clinical trials and the ongoing programme of continuous improvement across the supply chain and quality systems paving the way for increased capacity. Demand for the Company's products continues to be robust with the revenue achieved being limited by manufacturing capacity constraints. As previously announced a further increase in investment in plant and equipment is also planned to support the continuing improvements in manufacturing and quality which will be a multi-year investment. The focus has been on higher value products and markets, which are expected to enhance future profitability.\nCost of sales reduced to \u00a313.1m (2023 H1: \u00a314.1m) as a consequence of the reduced volumes allocated to manufacturing commercial sales batches.\nSales, marketing and distribution costs were lower than the prior period at \u00a310.2m (2023 H1: \u00a313.2m) mainly as a result of reduced marketing and promotional activity. Administrative expenses reduced to \u00a311.1m (2023 H1: \u00a311.9m) due to continued cost control initiatives. Exceptional costs were \u00a30.4m (2023 H1: \u00a30.4m) as a result of the ongoing review of funding options.\nThe operating loss pre-R&D and exceptional costs was \u00a30.1m (2023 H1: \u00a31.0m operating profit pre-R&D and exceptional costs). This loss was mitigated by the successful efforts to reduce distribution and administrative costs through cost control initiatives implemented over the past year.\nResearch and development costs increased to \u00a311.4m (2023 H1: \u00a38.5m) mainly due to the Group's pivotal G306 Phase III trial of Grass MATA MPL which successfully met its primary endpoint as prev",

Following an external safety review committee (SRC), it was determined that no safety signals had been observed and it was safe to proceed with incremental subcutaneous dosing in healthy subjects in the Phase I stage and in peanut allergic patients in the Phase IIa part of the trial.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"This is a key milestone in our journey to offer transformative outcomes to patients living with peanut allergies. We are excited to begin gathering data supportive of efficacy using biomarker technology which is aligned with recent FDA workshop thinking on demonstrating efficacy in clinical trials. We look forward to the complete results of this trial and continue to work towards the required planning for the phase II.\"\nThe PROTECT\ntrial is being conducted in both healthy volunteers and peanut allergic patients and consists of Part A and Part B. Part A involves subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) dosing in healthy volunteers (Group A1) and skin-prick testing in peanut allergic patients (Group A2), the latter of which was completed in April 2023.\nPart B of the clinical trial is double-blind, placebo-controlled and has commenced in subjects with peanut allergy at multiple clinical trial sites in the US. Up to 36 peanut-allergic subjects will be enrolled in Part B of the clinical trial, should the dosing advance to the highest dose as currently planned.\nThe Group will announce trial updates as is appropriate.\nMore information about the PROTECT trial can be found on\nClinicalTrials.gov\nunder the identifier\nNCT05476497\n.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK Market Abuse Regulations.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nPanmure Gordon (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nEmma Earl, Freddy Crossley, Mark Rogers, Corporate Finance\nRupert Dearden, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nICR Consilium\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@consilium-comms.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapy vaccines that have the potential to cure disease.

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

To access the digitalised Rx market, Redcare secured approval from the Ministry of Health and the gematik to launch a new and fully digital patient journey via CardLink. With this customer-centric solution, Redcare tripled its Rx market share within the year, reinforcing the pharmacy\u2019s market leadership in Germany to include prescription medications. Redcare pharmacy also became the market leader in Italy, where the online share of the pharmacy sector is approaching EUR 1 billion in revenue. With this achievement, Redcare is now market leader in five of its seven countries.

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

However in April they said that in addition to the 3.385 billion new shares to each of ZQ Capital and Southern Fox under a share subscription at 1p each.......\"it also plans to offer existing shareholders, including ZQ Capital and Southern Fox the chance to buy up to 689.5 million new shares at the discounted price under an open offer. ZQ Capital has agreed to underwrite the open offer and subscribe for any shares not taken up\"  I wait for further information on this as it may be a way of getting more shares at 1p and staying with the company, even if it goes private. Admittedly trading in private company shares is not as easy as when listed but if the company turns itself and comes back to the market the gains could be substantial. ZQ Capital and Southern Fox see potential and if the open offer to existing shareholders comes I see an opportunity. I have been with a listed company before that went private, decided to keep my shares, remain with the private company rather than take the cash for my shares, and more than doubled my money when they relisted. Not saying this will happen here but I do not see this totally negative yet so wait for further information.",

The major shareholders have provided sustained funding to the Group over the last 18 months, most recently via the participation in the uncommitted \u00a340m loan facility established in December 2023 of which \u00a322.5m has been drawn leaving \u00a317.5m remaining. The shareholders are aware of the Group funding needs over the next 12 months and remain supportive of the business\u201d This paragraph is what causes a degree of uncertainty - largely because it\u2019s rather vague about scale and terms. If one was cynical, one might expect further dilution.  Was hoping to see some further tangible progress notes for GRASS  and/or Peanut, but nothing there either.",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

To access the digitalised Rx market, Redcare secured approval from the Ministry of Health and the gematik to launch a new and fully digital patient journey via CardLink. With this customer-centric solution, Redcare tripled its Rx market share within the year, reinforcing the pharmacy\u2019s market leadership in Germany to include prescription medications. Redcare pharmacy also became the market leader in Italy, where the online share of the pharmacy sector is approaching EUR 1 billion in revenue. With this achievement, Redcare is now market leader in five of its seven countries.

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

ZQ Capital has agreed to underwrite the open offer and subscribe for any shares not taken up\"  I wait for further information on this as it may be a way of getting more shares at 1p and staying with the company, even if it goes private. Admittedly trading in private company shares is not as easy as when listed but if the company turns itself and comes back to the market the gains could be substantial. ZQ Capital and Southern Fox see potential and if the open offer to existing shareholders comes I see an opportunity. I have been with a listed company before that went private, decided to keep my shares, remain with the private company rather than take the cash for my shares, and more than doubled my money when they relisted. Not saying this will happen here but I do not see this totally negative yet so wait for further information.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

Vesting of 70 per cent. of the award subject to Adjusted EBITDA* performance and vesting of the remaining 30 per cent. of the award is subject to share price performance.\nThe following awards have been made in accordance with the Group LTIP:\nName\nTitle\nNumber of share options granted\nResultant\nnumber of share options held\nPerformance period\nVesting Date\nExercise price\nNumber of\nOrdinary Shares\nheld\nManuel Llobet\nChief Executive Officer\n5,409,724\n142,578,024\n3 years commencing 1 July 2025\n30 June 2028\n\u00a30.001\n5,001,200\nShaun Furlong\nChief Financial Officer\n2,489,627\n21,704,724\n3 years commencing 1 July 2025\n30 June 2028\n\u00a30.001\n1,507\nThe number of Ordinary Shares stated above is the maximum number that could be issued to each PDMR upon full satisfaction of the performance conditions attached to the awards.\nThe Group's Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions at periodic intervals to ensure they remain appropriate. As a result of any such review, the Committee will retain discretion to amend the conditions where appropriate having regard to overall Company performance and wider stakeholder experience.\nFollowing the above grants of options, the Company has options outstanding over 365,205,852 ordinary shares, representing 5.95% of the Company's current issued share capital.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the retained UK version of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (\"UK MAR\").\n*Adjusted EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the impact of R&D expenditure, exceptional items, equity settled long term incentive plans and gains or losses arising on fundraising activities. The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, make further adjustments to the Adjusted EBITDA figure disclosed in the Company's audited consolidated accounts for the relevant financial year, so that the Adjusted EBITDA figure fairly reflects underlying Group financial performance. Adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the cost of long-term strategic investments, approved after the relevant performance condition was set, with a short-term negative impact on Adjusted EBITDA in the relevant financial year. Such adjustments will be applied on a logical, transparent and consistent basis.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash/Giles Balleny/Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott/David Daley/Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

The shareholders are aware of the Group funding needs over the next 12 months and remain supportive of the business\u201d This paragraph is what causes a degree of uncertainty - largely because it\u2019s rather vague about scale and terms.

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens.

The major shareholders have provided sustained funding to the Group over the last 18 months, most recently via the participation in the uncommitted \u00a340m loan facility established in December 2023 of which \u00a322.5m has been drawn leaving \u00a317.5m remaining. The shareholders are aware of the Group funding needs over the next 12 months and remain supportive of the business\u201d This paragraph is what causes a degree of uncertainty - largely because it\u2019s rather vague about scale and terms. If one was cynical, one might expect further dilution.  Was hoping to see some further tangible progress notes for GRASS  and/or Peanut, but nothing there either.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",

The Group expects revenue for the six months ended 31 December 2025 to be \u00a336.3 million (2024: \u00a334.0 million), representing growth of 7 percent on a reported basis, or 3 percent on a constant currency basis*. This performance is positive given the ongoing transition away from unregistered products under Germany's TAV programme and reflects strong growth in the Group's existing German registered product portfolio. During the period, the Group received marketing authorisation in Germany for Grassmuno\u00ae, the first subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy approved under the TAV programme. Commercialisation commenced in January 2026 and sales momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half of the financial year. Overall Group sales for the full year ending 30 June 2026 are expected to exceed those achieved in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group's cash balance as at 31 December 2025 was \u00a310.1 million (30 June 2025: \u00a312.8 million). As previously announced, during the period the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of their warrants, generating aggregate proceeds of \u00a355 million. These proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding financial indebtedness owed to the Shareholder Lenders, significantly reducing the Group's level of debt and strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the Shareholder Lenders agreed to provide a new \u00a350 million unsecured loan facility although no amounts had been drawn as at 31 December 2025. Together with the previously announced \u00a320 million uncommitted Hayfin facility, the Group has access to total uncommitted funding of \u00a370 million, while it continues to explore a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company intends to announce its Interim Results in March 2026. https://allergytherapeutics2024eutfm.q4web.com/news/news-detai",

He said, \"We see significant opportunity in our pipeline,\" referring to two key products in development: the Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy, which has completed Phase III trials and is awaiting marketing authorization in Germany, and the VLP peanut allergy vaccine progressing through Phase I/II trials.Bullimore explained how the company's proprietary technologies, such as the MPL adjuvant and microcrystalline tyrosine depot, enable shorter treatment courses compared to traditional allergen immunotherapy. He also noted that Allergy Therapeutics is preparing for US market entry, with discussions planned with the FDA and expectations that the Grass MATA MPL product could meet a large unmet need.The presentation also covered the potential expansion of the VLP platform to address other severe allergies, including additional nuts and environmental allergens. Furlong concluded by stating that the company has a clear path to the US market, a committed shareholder base, and an experienced leadership team.",
