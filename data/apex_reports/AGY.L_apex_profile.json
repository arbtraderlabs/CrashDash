The first half of the year saw growth driven by improved operational execution and the restoration of reliability across our supply chain. December's regulatory approval in Germany for our subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy, Grass MATA MPL or Grassmuno\u00ae, represents a pivotal moment for the Group. This approval is particularly significant as the German allergen ordinance TAV process concludes later this year, leading to the market removal of competitor products that did not meet regulatory requirements.\n\"Our new product in Germany, which is our largest market, offers meaningful brand differentiation for patients and allows us to address the largest segment of the immunotherapy market. This approval also marks an important first step towards expanding our reach into other major global markets. Additionally, the interim analyses from our VLP Peanut program, investigating our next-generation peanut allergy immunotherapy candidate, continue to be encouraging, reinforcing our confidence in its potential. Together, the significant achievements of 2025 and our ongoing development programs position us well to execute our strategy and build sustainable value for the Group and shareholders.\"\nPeter Jensen, Chairman of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"By maintaining our sharp focus on priority R&D programmes, Allergy Therapeutics is making significant strides in our commitment to transforming patient care in allergy treatment. The regulatory approval in Germany of Grass MATA MPL was a significant milestone, and our comprehensive development strategy for this immunotherapy continues to advance, with a paediatric trial progressing on track. Subject to successful completion, this trial would support label expansion to include children, thereby enhancing the value of this important new product. Furthermore, achieving registration in Germany has proven that we now have a clinical trial methodology that, after many years of refinement, can be used as our standard for clinical trials on other indications, such as birch, ragweed, and others covering the most significant pollen allergy segments.\"\n*Constant currency uses prior year weighted average exchange rates to translate current year foreign currency denominated revenue to give a year-on-year comparison excluding the effects of foreign exchange movements\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulations.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash/Giles Balleny/Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott/David Daley/Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

The Board believes these appointments will directly support the Group's current explorations of a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, alongside its existing listing on the London Stock Exchange's AIM market, and the ambition to expand Allergy Therapeutics' presence in Asia and become a global leader in allergy treatments. The proposed appointments of the additional directors remain subject to completion of customary due diligence and will be effective upon receipt of shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting. A further announcement will be made in due course, as required.\nHelge Weiner-Trapness - Executive Director and Chief Strategy Officer\nUntil 2025, Mr Weiner-Trapness held the role of Vice Chairman, Global Banking, at HSBC, one of the world's largest financial organisations which is dual-listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

With earlier, senior positions at Barclays Bank, Asia Pacific Land, JP Morgan Securities and Goldman Sachs, Mr Weiner-Trapness brings more than 30 years of experience across some of the world's biggest investment banks in the US and Asia.\nIn the newly created role of Chief Strategy Officer, Mr Weiner-Trapness will drive the Group's long-term growth strategy, including corporate development, partnership strategy and portfolio prioritisation, as Allergy Therapeutics advances its next-generation pipeline and explores opportunities to deliver on its global ambitions.\nLawrence Allen Wang - Non-Executive Director\nLawrence Allen Wang is the Chief Financial Officer of Adicon (HKG: 9860) one of China's leading independent clinical laboratory service providers. Mr Wang led and executed the company's $88 million share financing in 2020, bringing in an international, blue-chip investor syndicate and, in 2023, successfully listed the company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Later that year the company qualified for entry into the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Stock Connect mutual market access programme, that links the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with Mainland China's two main exchanges. Mr Wang has more than 20 years of healthcare and investment experience. He qualified as a Doctor of Medicine from Boston University School of Medicine in 2003 and has an MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management.\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash /Giles Balleny/ Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / David Daley / Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nNotes for editors:\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.
