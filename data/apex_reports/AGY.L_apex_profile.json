The first half of the year saw growth driven by improved operational execution and the restoration of reliability across our supply chain. December's regulatory approval in Germany for our subcutaneous grass pollen immunotherapy, Grass MATA MPL or Grassmuno\u00ae, represents a pivotal moment for the Group. This approval is particularly significant as the German allergen ordinance TAV process concludes later this year, leading to the market removal of competitor products that did not meet regulatory requirements.\n\"Our new product in Germany, which is our largest market, offers meaningful brand differentiation for patients and allows us to address the largest segment of the immunotherapy market. This approval also marks an important first step towards expanding our reach into other major global markets. Additionally, the interim analyses from our VLP Peanut program, investigating our next-generation peanut allergy immunotherapy candidate, continue to be encouraging, reinforcing our confidence in its potential. Together, the significant achievements of 2025 and our ongoing development programs position us well to execute our strategy and build sustainable value for the Group and shareholders.\"\nPeter Jensen, Chairman of Allergy Therapeutics, commented:\n\"By maintaining our sharp focus on priority R&D programmes, Allergy Therapeutics is making significant strides in our commitment to transforming patient care in allergy treatment. The regulatory approval in Germany of Grass MATA MPL was a significant milestone, and our comprehensive development strategy for this immunotherapy continues to advance, with a paediatric trial progressing on track. Subject to successful completion, this trial would support label expansion to include children, thereby enhancing the value of this important new product. Furthermore, achieving registration in Germany has proven that we now have a clinical trial methodology that, after many years of refinement, can be used as our standard for clinical trials on other indications, such as birch, ragweed, and others covering the most significant pollen allergy segments.\"\n*Constant currency uses prior year weighted average exchange rates to translate current year foreign currency denominated revenue to give a year-on-year comparison excluding the effects of foreign exchange movements\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulations.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact:\nAllergy Therapeutics\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer\nShaun Furlong, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1903 845 820\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nGeoff Nash/Giles Balleny/Seamus Fricker\nNigel Birks - Life Science Specialist Sales\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott/David Daley/Davide Salvi\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nallergytherapeutics@icrhealthcare.com\nAbout Allergy Therapeutics\nAllergy Therapeutics is an international commercial biotechnology company, headquartered in the UK, focussed on the treatment and diagnosis of allergic disorders, including aluminium free immunotherapies that have the potential to cure disease.

It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic symptoms in adults caused by pollen from grasses (hay fever), such as running nose (rhinitis), allergic conjunctivitis (rhinoconjunctivitis), without asthma or with asthma that is well controlled. Treatment is administered before the grass-pollen season as a six-injection pre-seasonal course.\nThe approval marks the first subcutaneous grass-pollen immunotherapy to be authorised by the PEI through its TAV (Therapieallergene-Verordnung) framework and follows the submission of a comprehensive evidence package of quality, safety and clinical efficacy including the Group's pivotal Phase III G306 trial in adults. In that trial, the immunotherapy demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in the Combined Symptom & Medication Score (CSMS) compared to placebo over the peak pollen season.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, said:\n\"The regulatory approval of this state-of-the-art short-course aluminium-free immunotherapy is a defining moment for Allergy Therapeutics and for the future of allergy immunotherapy in Germany. Grass pollen, a common cause of seasonal allergy, significantly impacts the lives of many people and new treatment options are desperately needed. Grassmuno offers an effective, convenient treatment option for people living with a grass-pollen allergy, and its authorisation under the TAV regulation validates our clinical excellence and commitment to quality. It also validates our MATA MPL platform concept and establishes a strong foundation for our future expansion strategy for this innovative and disruptive immunotherapy with allergens such as birch and ragweed across other major global markets.\"\nGrass pollen is a key segment within the German seasonal allergy market, which is projected to reach ~US$1 billion by 20301.\nGrassmuno\nis expected to be a major driver of the Group's business in Germany, its largest market, as a regulatory-approved, short-course treatment approach that can be completed before the allergy season begins. This offers the potential for people living with a grass pollen allergy to achieve protection without the burden of months-long treatment schedules.\nIn November 2024 the Group commenced a\nPhase III trial\n(G308) to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of Grass MATA MPL in a paediatric population. That trial is the first long-term SCIT trial in a paediatric population and complements Allergy Therapeutics' previous studies in adults, furthering its comprehensive development strategy for the immunotherapy across different age groups.\nAllergy Therapeutics continues to explore the potential for additional registration opportunities in other major global markets, following engagement with authorities regarding local regulatory requirements.\n- ENDS -\nReferences\n1.\nInternal company projections\nAbout Grass MATA MPL\nGrass MATA MPL is a subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy to treat moderate to severe allergic symptoms in adults caused by pollen from grasses, such as running nose (rhinitis), allergic conjunctivitis (rhinoconjunctivitis), without asthma or with asthma that is well controlled. It is given before the start of the pollen season.\nThe immunotherapy contains an extract of 13 grass pollens modified with glutaraldehyde to form allergoids that reduces the reactivity with immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies without a reduction in other important immunological properties, such as T-cell reactivity. The allergoid is adsorbed to microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT) as a depot adjuvant system formulation. Monophosphoryl lipid-A (MPL), is included as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the immunotherapy and to enhance the switch from an allergen specific helper T-cell Type 2 (Th2) to helper T-cell Type 1 (Th1) like immune response.\nThe information contained within this announcement is\ndeemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (\"MAR\") EU no.596/2014.
