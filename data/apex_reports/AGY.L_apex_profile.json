It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic symptoms in adults caused by pollen from grasses (hay fever), such as running nose (rhinitis), allergic conjunctivitis (rhinoconjunctivitis), without asthma or with asthma that is well controlled. Treatment is administered before the grass-pollen season as a six-injection pre-seasonal course.\nThe approval marks the first subcutaneous grass-pollen immunotherapy to be authorised by the PEI through its TAV (Therapieallergene-Verordnung) framework and follows the submission of a comprehensive evidence package of quality, safety and clinical efficacy including the Group's pivotal Phase III G306 trial in adults. In that trial, the immunotherapy demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in the Combined Symptom & Medication Score (CSMS) compared to placebo over the peak pollen season.\nManuel Llobet, Chief Executive Officer of Allergy Therapeutics, said:\n\"The regulatory approval of this state-of-the-art short-course aluminium-free immunotherapy is a defining moment for Allergy Therapeutics and for the future of allergy immunotherapy in Germany. Grass pollen, a common cause of seasonal allergy, significantly impacts the lives of many people and new treatment options are desperately needed. Grassmuno offers an effective, convenient treatment option for people living with a grass-pollen allergy, and its authorisation under the TAV regulation validates our clinical excellence and commitment to quality. It also validates our MATA MPL platform concept and establishes a strong foundation for our future expansion strategy for this innovative and disruptive immunotherapy with allergens such as birch and ragweed across other major global markets.\"\nGrass pollen is a key segment within the German seasonal allergy market, which is projected to reach ~US$1 billion by 20301.\nGrassmuno\nis expected to be a major driver of the Group's business in Germany, its largest market, as a regulatory-approved, short-course treatment approach that can be completed before the allergy season begins. This offers the potential for people living with a grass pollen allergy to achieve protection without the burden of months-long treatment schedules.\nIn November 2024 the Group commenced a\nPhase III trial\n(G308) to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of Grass MATA MPL in a paediatric population. That trial is the first long-term SCIT trial in a paediatric population and complements Allergy Therapeutics' previous studies in adults, furthering its comprehensive development strategy for the immunotherapy across different age groups.\nAllergy Therapeutics continues to explore the potential for additional registration opportunities in other major global markets, following engagement with authorities regarding local regulatory requirements.\n- ENDS -\nReferences\n1.\nInternal company projections\nAbout Grass MATA MPL\nGrass MATA MPL is a subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy to treat moderate to severe allergic symptoms in adults caused by pollen from grasses, such as running nose (rhinitis), allergic conjunctivitis (rhinoconjunctivitis), without asthma or with asthma that is well controlled. It is given before the start of the pollen season.\nThe immunotherapy contains an extract of 13 grass pollens modified with glutaraldehyde to form allergoids that reduces the reactivity with immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies without a reduction in other important immunological properties, such as T-cell reactivity. The allergoid is adsorbed to microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT) as a depot adjuvant system formulation. Monophosphoryl lipid-A (MPL), is included as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the immunotherapy and to enhance the switch from an allergen specific helper T-cell Type 2 (Th2) to helper T-cell Type 1 (Th1) like immune response.\nThe information contained within this announcement is\ndeemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (\"MAR\") EU no.596/2014.

To date only the \u00a320m committed facility has been drawn.\nFollowing discussions with major shareholders, the existing loan facility of \u00a340m was increased to \u00a350m and its term extended to October 2030.\nAt 30 June 2025, \u00a337.5m of the facility had been drawn with \u00a312.5m of the uncommitted facility remaining.\n-\nCash balance of \u00a312.8m at 30 June 2025 (2024: \u00a312.9m).\nPost\n-\nPeriod Financial Events\n-\nPost-period, the Group drew down the remaining \u00a312.5m of its existing shareholder loan facility. The lenders subsequently exercised the related warrants, and the proceeds were used to repay the facility in full, with net proceeds of \u00a31m received by the Company. A new \u00a350m unsecured, uncommitted shareholder loan facility was also put in place.\n-\nPost-period, the Group announced that it is exploring a dual primary listing of its ordinary shares on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\nOperational\n-\nContinued progression of the Marketing Authorisation Application for Grass MATA MPL with the Paul Ehrlich Institut, supported by the publication of comprehensive Phase III G306 data in\nAllergy\n.

Safety remained favourable throughout, and dose dependent reductions in skin sensitivity and biomarker shifts continued to reinforce the candidate's potential.\nManuel Llobet, CEO of Allergy Therapeutics,\nstated: \"\nThis year we focused on strengthening the business and building real momentum across the Group. We sharpened our priorities, reinforced our financial position and pushed ahead with the programmes that will shape our future. It has been a year of disciplined progress and clear direction.\n\"Our clinical programmes continue to move forward. Grass MATA MPL is progressing through the regulatory process in Germany, supported by strong Phase III data. The VLP Peanut PROTECT trial has also continued to generate encouraging safety and biomarker data, giving us confidence as we look ahead to the next stage of development.\n\"Looking to 2026, we see a year of opportunity.

Alongside continued cost controls throughout the year, the Group is well positioned to deliver on its commitment to transform patient care in allergy while building sustainable value for the company and shareholders.\nFinancial Performance\nThe Group maintained stable financial performance in 2025 which, alongside the pivotal advancements in our R&D pipeline and a shifting regulatory landscape in the European allergy treatment market, supports our outlook for future growth.\nOur long-term funding secured during the period with Hayfin Healthcare Opportunities LuxCo S.a.r.l., a fund advised by Hayfin Capital Management LLP, and the continued support from our major shareholders, SkyGem Acquisition Limited (an affiliate of ZQ Capital Management Limited) and Southern Fox Investments Limited, enabled the Group to continue progression of key R&D programmes, enhance our supply chain and invest in strategic priorities to drive the business forward.\nThe Board believes the Group is well placed to benefit from the changing regulatory environment in Germany, one of our major markets, and the upcoming end of the TAV transition period in 2026. As unregistered allergy treatments are withdrawn from the market, as is expected, in a national regulatory shift to fully licensed products, Allergy Therapeutics is in a position of strength, due to the breadth of our existing registered product portfolio and the scale of our commercial operations.\nClinical development\nGrass MATA MPL - Delivering a step change in the management of grass pollen allergy\nThe submission of our Marketing Authorisation Application to the Paul Ehrlich Institut in Germany at the end of 2024, for Grass MATA MPL, was a significant milestone and a significant achievement by our team. This next-generation subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) candidate to address the cause of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen has the potential to be a major treatment advance for the many people who suffer from this form of seasonal allergy. The regulatory submission has been a significant investment of time and resources for the Group. Alongside that work, substantial efforts continue within our commercial and medical affairs teams to prepare for the product's commercial launch. This will ensure that we can provide it to patients who could benefit as soon as possible.\nImportantly, in February 2025, comprehensive Phase III data from the pivotal G306 trial were published in the journal Allergy, reinforcing the treatment's efficacy and safety profile and supporting the regulatory application with robust peer-reviewed evidence.\nOur investment in this product candidate reflects our continued belief in its potential. In October 2025 we continued the development programme, screening the first paediatric patients for year 2 in the Group's Phase III G308 trial. This trial is the first time a grass pollen SCIT has been evaluated long-term in a paediatric population, a significant milestone for the allergy field and one that reflects our commitment to advancing new treatment approaches for patients.\nVLP Peanut - A next-generation peanut allergy immunotherapy\nThe clinical development of the Group's innovative, short-course peanut allergy immunotherapy candidate, VLP Peanut, via subcutaneous injection, continues to progress well. The Phase I/IIa PROTECT trial moved to its final phase of treatment during the period, with healthy volunteers receiving subcutaneous doses of the candidate immunotherapy beyond the expected therapeutic dose, establishing a strong safety margin. In addition, the third of four planned cohorts of peanut-allergic patients continued to progress through dose escalation, also at levels beyond the anticipated therapeutic range.\nAn interim analysis of the first two of the four cohorts of peanut allergic patients in the PROTECT trial showed that treatment with VLP Peanut resulted in a meaningful dose-dependent reduction in skin sensitivity to peanut allergen, with treated patients in cohort 2 showing a 48% reduction in wheal size after skin-prick test compared to an 8% reduction in those treated with placebo. Additionally, a comparison of the biomarker profile between treatment and placebo pointed to VLP Peanut driving a reduction in allergic response to the major peanut allergen, Ara h 2.\nThese interim analysis data represent the first demonstration of an immunologic response using a nanoparticle-based approach in peanut allergic patients. Results from PROTECT to date have established that this immunotherapy candidate not only circumvents triggering allergic reactions but also effectively modulates the immune system, potentially leading to long-term protection. The consistency in immunological response seen at these early doses, combined with the consistent, positive safety profile, is particularly encouraging.\nPeanut allergy remains a growing public health concern, particularly in the US and Europe, with limited effective treatment options. There remains an urgent and compelling need for a therapy that ensures sustained protection during extended treatment-free periods. We believe this product has the potential to be a groundbreaking, disease-modifying immunotherapy that could bring a significant positive impact to the lives of patients, families and health systems affected by peanut allergy.\nWe are keen to present preliminary efficacy data based upon biomarkers by the end of this year and to identify an optimal therapeutic dose for phase II development.\nMaintaining scientific leadership\nCommunicating to the broader healthcare community remains a key aspect of our work and it is a great source of pride that Allergy Therapeutics maintained its significant presence at the major annual allergy-focused scientific conferences this year, sharing the latest advancements from our pipeline at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology / World Allergy Organization (AAAAI / WAO) Joint Congress and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Congress.\nAt the EAACI Congress, Allergy Therapeutics furthered its commitment to advancing allergy and immunology research and innovation by collaborating with EAACI to support the Academy's Early Career Research Award. Encouraging the next generation of researchers is vital to advancing our understanding of allergy and translating innovation into new therapeutic approaches that can meaningfully improve the lives of people living with allergies. Alongside EAACI we were proud to play our part in fostering scientific excellence, and we again congratulate award winner Dr. Janice Layhadi, a Research Associate at Imperial College London's National Heart and Lung Institute and a rising star whose research is at the forefront of allergy and immunology research.\nThrough the year we maintained our commitment to sharing data and insights from our research with scientific colleagues, with publications in leading allergy journals. These included comprehensive datasets and learnings from our Grass MATA MPL Phase III programme in Allergy and early research validating the mechanism of action of VLP Peanut in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\nCorporate initiatives\nThis year we initiated a company-wide share option awards programme, a pioneering long-term incentive plan for all Allergy Therapeutics employees, regardless of role. The Board's decision to launch this programme in 2025 recognises the Group's strongest strategic position in recent years and, importantly, the contributions of everyone across the business to delivering against our ambitious strategy.\nDuring the period, we undertook a change in our Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker - an important strategic decision aligned with the company's evolving needs and long-term ambitions. We are grateful to our former adviser for their guidance and support over the years, and for the important role they played in our journey to date. We have established a productive and collaborative relationship with our new adviser, Cavendish Capital Markets, as we continue to advance our corporate objectives.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, the Board remains confident in the Group's prospects, with multiple opportunities for growth and for value creation from our commercial business and the progress anticipated within our innovative pipeline. With strong momentum across the Group, we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment to transform patient care in allergy.\nPost year end it was announced to the London Stock Exchange that the Group is exploring a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, alongside our existing listing in London. This is a strategic move that reflects our ambition to expand Allergy Therapeutics' presence in Asia and to strengthen our position as a global leader in allergy immunotherapy.\nFinancial review\nReconciliation of loss before tax to Adjusted EBITDA (see Note 4)\nAdjusted EBITDA is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies' performance measures.

This reflects an earlier than expected impact of the approaching change in the German regulatory landscape, as the end of the TAV transition period is reached in 2026. On a constant currency basis revenue grew at over 2%, with revenue in Germany declining slightly due to the reasons mentioned above and strong growth in the Group's second largest market, Spain, of 11%.\nConfidence in prospects for the German market are underpinned by promising sales of first-year (patient initiation) treatments. A continued decline in orders for the Group's unregistered Pollinex Quattro product in the last two months of the financial year were more than offset by increased orders for its registered Grass, Trees and Venomil products.\nContinuing cost controls operated during the year have managed the cost base of the Group whilst enabling selective investment in strategic growth related projects. Total administrative expenses excluding R&D reduced by \u00a30.3m to \u00a343.3m despite the new investments that were initiated.\nOther administrative costs increased by \u00a31.4m to \u00a319.1m reflecting initiatives that were commenced in the year. These include greater investment in market research activities, increased travel to key industry events and consultancy related to future growth initiatives.\nThe Group has continued to selectively invest in its programme of clinical trials. R&D spend reduced by 33% to \u00a315.4m (2024: \u00a322.9m), mainly due to the prior period including the peak activity of the Group's pivotal G306 Phase III trial of Grass MATA MPL which successfully met its primary endpoint during H1 of FY2024. During the year the Group commenced its five-year long paediatric study (G308) with the first subjects screened and enrolled and then treated later in Q4 2024. The Phase I/IIa VLP Peanut PROTECT trial is ongoing with no safety signals observed to date.\nThe Group measures the commercial performance of the business by monitoring Adjusted EBITDA (see Note 4), the Group achieved an Adjusted EBITDA loss of \u00a39.0m for the year (2024: loss \u00a37.6m). The loss before tax was \u00a339.2m (2024: \u00a339.2m). The increased Adjusted EBITDA loss was a reflection of the flat revenue performance combined with investments in strategies to support future growth.\nOther income in the year of \u00a31.2m (2024: \u00a31.5m) was due to R&D tax credits in the UK and Spain, the decrease is consistent with the reduction in R&D spend in the year.\nFinancing costs\nFinancing costs increased by \u00a33.0m to \u00a37.2m (2024: \u00a34.2m) as a result of the increased level of debt from both the shareholder loan and Hayfin borrowings. The loans drawn down in the year have been primarily used to fund the R&D programme, capital expenditure and working capital.\nEarnings per share\nBasic loss per share for the year was (0.84) pence (2024 restated: (1.03) pence), the reduction primarily driven by an increase in the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the period.\nTax\nThe current year tax charge is predominantly comprised of liabilities for tax in the Spanish and German subsidiaries. The overall charge in the income statement is \u00a30.9m (2024 restated: credit \u00a30.5m). As at 30 June 2025, the Group had approximately \u00a3196m of unutilised UK tax losses (2024: approximately \u00a3167m) available for offset against future profits. The credit for the year ended 30 June 2024 includes prior period adjustments, refer to Note 20 for further details and a summary of the impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2024 as well as the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2024.\nBalance sheet\nDuring the year the Group continued to develop the Energy Centre in Worthing to strengthen business continuity and establish independence from GSK. In April 2025 the handover of the plant to the Group was successfully completed. Property, plant and equipment additions in the year were \u00a33.7m (2024: \u00a34.1m), reflecting investment in the Worthing Energy Centre and the continuing upgrade of plant in both the UK and Spain.\nInventories have increased to \u00a313.9m (2024: \u00a312.7m) as the Company continues to stock build ahead of the next peak season.\nCash and cash equivalents were similar to prior year at \u00a312.8m (2024: \u00a312.9m). The operating cash outflow was \u00a328.1m (2024: \u00a332.1m) as a result of the operating loss for the period, and \u00a32.9m investing outflow (2024: \u00a31.2m), primarily on the purchase of property, plant and equipment, offset by a net \u00a331.2m inflow from financing activities (2024: \u00a331.4m) due to the increased funding from the Hayfin and shareholder loans.\nRetirement benefit obligations, which relate solely to the German pension scheme, remained stable at \u00a38.6m (2024: \u00a38.6m).\nNet assets of the Group decreased from \u00a37.4m (restated) to negative \u00a328.2m, as a consequence of the trading losses for the period and use of the Hayfin and shareholder facilities to fund the business.\nCurrency\nGroup Treasury Policy mandates the use of forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure to the effects of exchange rates where expenditure/income is committed and/or reasonably certain; however, throughout the financial year no hedge contracts were operated. This is due to security having been previously transferred from our primary banking provider to the shareholders as security for the shareholder loan.\nWith over 85% of revenues and approximately 40% of costs (excluding research and development costs) denominated in Euros, and approximately 40% of research and development costs denominated in US Dollars, movements in the currency markets may have an effect on the Group's operational finances. It is the Group's intention to reinstate its hedging policy as soon as practicable.\nFinancing\nOn 15 October 2024, following discussions with major shareholders, SkyGem Acquisition Limited (an affiliate of ZQ Capital Management Limited) and Southern Fox Investments Limited (together the \"Shareholder Lenders\"), the existing loan facility of \u00a340m, details of which were announced on 27 December 2023, was increased to \u00a350m and its term extended to October 2030. The Shareholder Facility has been amended (\"the Amended Shareholder Facility\") to be unsecured and rank behind the Hayfin Facility. In addition, interest under the Shareholder Facility will no longer be paid and instead interest will be rolled up into capital.\nAt 30 June 2025, \u00a337.5m (2024: 22.5m) of the Amended Shareholder Facility had been drawn, a further \u00a312.5m has been drawn down since the year end. Along with previous drawdowns the entire amount of the Amended Shareholder Facility has now been drawn and a total of 1,375,000,000 warrants issued. On 29 October 2025, the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of the 1,375,000,000 warrants, the proceeds from which were used to repay the Amended Shareholder Facility in full (including all capitalised and accrued interest). The Company also received net proceeds of \u00a31m, after repayment of the Amended Shareholder Facility, paid to the Company in cash.\nFurthermore, the Shareholder Lenders have agreed to provide a new \u00a350m unsecured loan facility (the \"Renewed Shareholder Facility\") on an uncommitted basis. The Renewed Shareholder Facility is available to draw down from 29 October 2025 until 15 July 2030, with interest payable at 12 per cent. per annum and a repayment date of 15 October 2030.\nOn 15 October 2024 the Group entered into a \u00a340m secured senior loan facility (the \"Hayfin Facility\") with Hayfin Healthcare Opportunities LuxCo S.a.r.l., a fund advised by Hayfin Capital Management LLP (\"Hayfin\"). The Hayfin Facility consists of a committed \u00a320m five year term loan and an additional uncommitted \u00a320m incremental facility. As part of these financing arrangements, the Company has also issued to Hayfin 131,603,616 warrants to subscribe for new ordinary shares, representing approximately 2.7% of the issued share capital of the Company, with a nominal exercise price of 0.1 pence per warrant and exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of issue. The Hayfin \u00a320m loan was subject to an upfront arrangement fee and has a variable interest rate based on SONIA plus 9.5% per annum with interest payable based on Company selected interest periods. To date only the \u00a320m committed facility has been drawn.\nAs explained more fully in Note 1, Basis of preparation, the Directors have adopted the Going Concern basis in preparing the audited consolidated financial statements.\nPost-balance sheet events\nPlease refer to Note 21 for details of events after the balance sheet date.\nConsolidated income statement\nfor the year ended 30 June 2025\nNote\nYear to\n30 June 2025 \u00a3'000\nYear to\n30 June 2025\n\u00a3'000\nYear to\n30 June 2024\n(as restated)\n\u00a3'000\nYear to\n30 June 2024\n(as restated)\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n3\n55,044\n55,199\nCost of sales\n(25,742)\n(25,462)\nGross profit\n29,302\n29,737\nSales, marketing and distribution costs\n(19,202)\n(19,591)\nResearch and development costs\n(15,377)\n(22,900)\nDepreciation expense\n11\n(3,616)\n(3,787)\nAmortisation expense\n(556)\n(532)\nShare-based payment expense\n(871)\n(759)\nRestructuring costs\n-\n(1,239)\nAdministration expenses -

Basis of preparation\nThe financial information in this announcement has been extracted from the Group's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 and is prepared in accordance with UK-adopted IFRS.\nWhist the financial information included in this preliminary announcement has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), this announcement itself does not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. The financial information set out in this preliminary announcement does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006.\nStatutory accounts for the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 have been reported on by the independent auditor. The independent auditor's report for the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 were unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis. The reports for the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for the year to 30 June 2025 will be delivered following the Company's annual general meeting.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2025 (including comparatives) have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain items, as stated in the accounting policies.\nPrior period adjustments\nThere are prior period adjustments relating to the valuation of the liability for uncertain tax positions as at 30 June 2024 and the deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2024. Refer to Note 20 for further details.\nAs required by IFRS the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2025 includes a third statement of financial position as at 30 June 2023, the beginning of the preceding period.\nConsolidated income statement presentation\nThe line items and subtotals presented in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2025 are different to those presented in the Group's financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024. The changes made are (a) removal of the 'Operating loss pre-R&D and exceptional costs' subtotal, (b) inclusion of costs previously presented below 'Operating loss pre-R&D and exceptional costs' within the 'Total administrative expenses' subtotal, (c) removal of the line item 'Exceptional costs', replaced by 'Restructuring costs', and (d) new line items for 'Depreciation expense', 'Amortisation expense' and 'Share-based payment expense' split out from the 'Administration expenses - other' line item. The new presentation is considered by the Group to be more relevant to an understanding of the Group's overall financial performance. The comparative in the consolidated income statement has been updated to reflect the new presentation, however no amounts have been restated vs those previously reported.\nNew standards adopted\nThere are no IFRS or IAS interpretations that are effective for the first time in this financial period that have had a material impact on the Group.\nStandards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements, several new, but not yet effective, standards and amendments to existing standards and interpretations have been published by the IASB. None of these standards or amendments to existing standards have been adopted early by the Group.\nManagement anticipates that all relevant pronouncements will be adopted for the first period beginning on or after the effective date of the pronouncement. New standards, amendments and interpretations not adopted in the current year have not been disclosed as they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\nGoing concern\nThe going concern period has been assessed as the twelve-month period from the date of approval of the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis after considering the Group's and the Company's current cash position and reviewing budgets and cash flow forecasts for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements. The parent company is a holding company and as such, its going concern status is intrinsically linked to the Group. The going concern assessment for the parent company was performed as part of the Group's assessment.\nBetween the balance sheet date and 20 October 2025, the Group drew down \u00a312.5m under the Amended Shareholder Facility. Along with previous drawdowns the entire amount of the Amended Shareholder Facility has now been drawn and a total of 1,375,000,000 warrants issued. On 29 October 2025, the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of the 1,375,000,000 warrants, the proceeds from which were used to repay the Amended Shareholder Facility in full (including all capitalised and accrued interest). The Company also received net proceeds of \u00a31m, after repayment of the Amended Shareholder Facility, paid to the Company in cash. The exercise of warrants, issuance of new Ordinary Shares and repayment of the Amended Shareholder Facility has significantly strengthened the Group and the Company's balance sheet.\nFurthermore, the Shareholder Lenders have agreed to provide a new \u00a350m unsecured loan facility (the \"Renewed Shareholder Facility\") on an uncommitted basis. The Renewed Shareholder Facility is available to draw down from 29 October 2025 until 15 July 2030, with interest payable at 12 per cent per annum and a repayment date of 15 October 2030. There are no warrants attached to the drawdown of the facility extended under the Renewed Shareholder Facility. The Shareholder Lenders have committed to make available at least \u00a340m of funding in the going concern period, as and when requested by the Company, as a loan under the Renewed Shareholder Facility. The total \u00a340m shareholder funding commitment is reduced by any funding received from other third parties, and has no restrictions on drawdowns.\nThe Group continues to require funding for the foreseeable future, in particular to fund the ongoing R&D programme. The Directors have confidence in the ability to access the uncommitted funding during the next twelve months with the shareholders undertaking that funding would be available from them under the Renewed Shareholder Facility in the event that it was required.\nThe Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the twelve-month period from the date of the signing of the financial statements based on the arrangements in place for funding and the above representations provided by the Shareholder Lenders. The Directors have stress tested the forecasted cash flows by considering severe but plausible downside scenarios, including mitigating actions that could be taken to preserve cash through the deferral of capital expenditure and other spend items. These forecasts show that, even in the stress tested scenarios, the Group has access to sufficient funds for the twelve-month going concern review period. Furthermore, the forecasts for the entirety of the going concern period show that there would be no breach of the financial covenants attached to the Hayfin Facility, as set out in Note 16, even in a severe but plausible downside scenario. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of November 2025 was \u00a311.9m.\n2. Use of accounting estimates and judgements\nThe Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.\nJudgements\na) Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. At 30 June 2025, the Group had \u00a3196m (2024: \u00a3167m) of unutilised UK tax losses available for offset against future profits. At the UK's current rate of corporation tax the unutilised tax losses equate to a potential deferred tax asset of \u00a349.0m (2024: \u00a341.8m); however only \u00a31.8m (2024: \u00a31.8m) of this is recognised as a deferred tax asset, and the remaining \u00a347.2m (2024: \u00a340.0m) potential deferred tax asset is unrecognised at the balance sheet date together with \u00a32.6m (2024: \u00a32.3m) of other short term temporary timing differences and tax credits as there is not currently sufficient convincing evidence that taxable profits will be available against which these losses and other deductible temporary differences and tax credits will be utilised in the foreseeable future. Management reassesses the probable availability of future taxable profits on a regular basis.\nb) The Group's operational structure gives rise to potential tax exposures that require management to exercise judgement in making determinations as to the amount of tax that is payable. The Group reports cross-border transactions undertaken between subsidiaries on an arm's-length basis in tax returns in accordance with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Transfer pricing relies on the exercise of judgement, and it is reasonably possible for there to be a significant range of potential outcomes. At 30 June 2025, the Group had recognised liabilities of \u00a30.8m (2024: \u00a30.8m as restated) in respect of uncertain tax positions on the balance sheet. The amount recognised represents the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes and as such is sensitive to changes in the probability assessed for each possible outcome. Possible outcomes range from \u00a3nil to \u00a31.3m (2024: \u00a3nil to \u00a31.3m).\nCritical estimates and assumptions\na) The Group operates a partly funded non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees in Germany. The defined assets and liabilities of this scheme and the related investments - retirement benefit assets - are estimated using actuarial methods by third-party experts. The net defined benefit liability is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate applied.\nb) The Group has issued warrants to subscribe for shares, some of which do not meet the conditions to be classified as equity instruments and are therefore treated as an embedded derivative financial instrument. The embedded derivative is held on the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with movements in fair value taken to the income statement. At 30 June 2025, the embedded derivative is valued at \u00a310.5m, an increase of \u00a34.7m compared to when it was initially recognised in October 2024, representing a loss on revaluation in the consolidated income statement. The most significant variable in valuing the embedded derivative is the Group's share price at the date of the valuation. The share price movement during the current period, where the fair value of the embedded derivative increased by \u00a34.7m (81%), was an 87% increase from 4.25p per share at 15th October 2024 to 7.95p at 30 June 2025.\nc) The Group's shareholder loan facility, as described more fully in Note 16, is a compound financial instrument due to the attached warrants, which entitle holders to subscribe for new Ordinary Shares. Each time funds are drawn down under the shareholder loan facility the proceeds received are allocated into their liability and equity components by first valuing the debt component, with the residual allocated to equity. The debt component is valued by discounting the contractual cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include warrants. At 30 June 2025, \u00a337.5m (2024: \u00a322.5m) of shareholder loan funding had been drawn (net of \u00a35.0m drawn in August 2024 and repaid in October 2024), of which \u00a34.4m (2024: \u00a31.3m) was allocated to the warrants on initial recognition. Furthermore, the shareholder loan facility was modified during the year and this was deemed to be a substantial modification due to the fact the discounted present value of the cash flows under the facility after the amendment (using the original effective interest rate) were greater than 10% different to the carrying value of the facility at the time of modification. A gain of \u00a30.4m arose on modification, representing the difference between the present value of the amended cash flows, using the market rate of interest at the time of modification, compared to the carrying value of the facility at that time. The initial allocation of loan proceeds between debt and equity, and the calculation of the gain arising on modification of the loan are both sensitive to the market rate of interest used to discount the contractual cash flows. The Group engaged external consultants Globalview Advisors (now part of FRP Advisory) to calculate appropriate market rate(s) of interest. Globalview determine market interest rates by (i) performing a synthetic credit rating for the Group; (ii) analysis of bond yields, issued by companies in similar sectors and/or financial profile and (iii) an estimate of a market interest rate in line with benchmark data. Market interest rates used during the year ended 30 June 2025 range from 14.4% to 16.3% (2024: 15.4%).\nOther estimates and assumptions\na) The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans (LTIP schemes) for remuneration of its employees. Employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are measured at their fair values and expensed over the vesting period. The fair value of this compensation is dependent on, amongst other factors, whether the provisional share awards will ultimately vest, which in turn is dependent on future events which are uncertain. The Directors use their judgement and experience of previous awards to estimate the probability that the awards will vest, which impacts the fair valuation of the compensation. The key variables to be estimated are the number of awards that will lapse before the vesting date due to leavers, and the number of awards that will vest in relation to the non-market performance conditions.\n3. Revenue\nAn analysis of revenue by category is set out in the table below:\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nSale of goods at a point in time\n55,044\n55,199\n55,044\n55,199\nAll revenue recognised in the income statement is from contracts with customers. The majority of these customers are on 14 to 30 day payment terms. No assets were recognised from costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with any customer.\n4. Alternative performance measures (\"APMs\")\nThe Group's APMs are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies' APMs. These measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.\nEBITDA\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (\"EBITDA\") is included as an alternative performance measure in order to aid users in understanding the underlying operating performance of the Group.\nNote\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nLoss before taxation\n(39,200)\n(39,166)\nNet finance expense\n6,7\n6,784\n3,909\nDepreciation\n11\n3,616\n3,787\nAmortisation\n556\n532\nEBITDA\n(28,244)\n(30,938)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the impact of research and development, non-recurring items, equity settled long term incentive plans and gains or losses arising on fundraising activities (Adjusted EBITDA) is included as an alternative performance measure in order to aid users in understanding the underlying operating performance of the Group.\nThese can be reconciled to the IFRS measure of loss before taxation as below:\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nLoss before taxation\n(39,200)\n(39,166)\nNet finance expense\n6,784\n3,909\nDepreciation\n3,616\n3,787\nAmortisation\n556\n532\nResearch and development\n15,377\n22,900\nOther income\n(1,244)\n(1,526)\nRestructuring costs\n-\n1,239\nShare-based payment expense\n871\n759\nRevaluation of warrant instrument held at fair value\n4,684\n-\nGain on modification of shareholder loan\n(430)\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(8,986)\n(7,566)\n5. Segmental reporting\nThe Group's operating segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Executive Directors, who are defined as the CODM, to enable them to allocate resources and make strategic decisions. In the opinion of the Directors, there is one class of business, being the manufacture and sale of allergy-related medicines.\nThe CODM reviews information based on geographical market sectors and assesses performance at an EBITDA (operating loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and operating loss level. Management have identified that the reportable segments are Central Europe (which includes the following operating segments: Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands), Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Other), the Rest of the World (including the UK).\nFor all material regions that have been aggregated, management consider that they share similar economic characteristics. They are also similar in respect of the products sold, types of customer, distribution channels and regulatory environments.\nRevenue by segment\nRevenue from external customers\n2025\n\u00a3'000\nInter-segment revenue\n2025\n\u00a3'000\nTotal segment revenue\n2025\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue from external customers\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nInter-segment revenue\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nTotal segment revenue\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n- Germany\n26,685\n-\n26,685\n27,298\n-\n27,298\n- Austria\n5,258\n-\n5,258\n4,947\n-\n4,947\n- Netherlands\n3,963\n-\n3,963\n4,062\n-\n4,062\n- Switzerland\n2,335\n-\n2,335\n2,864\n-\n2,864\n38,241\n-\n38,241\n39,171\n-\n39,171\nSouthern Europe\n-\n- Italy\n2,869\n-\n2,869\n3,074\n-\n3,074\n- Spain\n9,596\n-\n9,596\n8,878\n-\n8,878\n- Other\n196\n-\n196\n368\n-\n368\n12,661\n-\n12,661\n12,320\n-\n12,320\nRest of World (including UK)\n4,142\n30,634\n34,776\n3,708\n30,412\n34,120\n55,044\n30,634\n85,678\n55,199\n30,412\n85,611\nRevenues from external customers in all segments are derived principally from the sale of a range of pharmaceutical products designed for the immunological treatment of the allergic condition.\nRest of World (including UK) revenues include sales through distributors and agents in several markets including the Czech Republic, Slovakia and South Korea.\nThe CODM also reviews revenue by segment on a budgeted constant currency basis, to provide relevant year-on-year comparisons.\nThe Group has no customers which individually account for 10% or more of the Group's revenue.\nSales, marketing and distribution costs by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n12,299\n12,389\nSouthern Europe\n4,742\n5,320\nRest of World (including UK)\n2,161\n1,882\n19,202\n19,591\nResearch and development costs by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n-\n-\nSouthern Europe\n-\n-\nRest of World (including UK)\n15,377\n22,900\n15,377\n22,900\nAdministration expenses by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n5,150\n5,297\nSouthern Europe\n1,612\n1,203\nRest of World (including UK)\n12,324\n11,212\n19,086\n17,712\nDepreciation and amortisation by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n1,341\n1,265\nSouthern Europe\n800\n831\nRest of World (including UK)\n2,031\n2,223\n4,172\n4,319\nFinance income by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n112\n150\nSouthern Europe\n1\n5\nRest of World (including UK)\n269\n130\n382\n285\nFinance expense by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n487\n449\nSouthern Europe\n31\n40\nRest of World (including UK)\n6,\n648\n3,705\n7,166\n4,194\nEBITDA by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nAllocated EBITDA\nCentral Europe\n1,215\n2,079\nSouthern Europe\n1,554\n1,585\nRest of World (including UK)\n(31,013)\n(34,602)\nAllocated EBITDA\n(28,244)\n(30,938)\nDepreciation and amortisation\n(4,172)\n(4,319)\nFinance income\n382\n285\nFinance expense\n(7,166)\n(4,194)\nLoss before tax\n(39,200)\n(39,166)\nTax charge / (credit) by segment\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\nas restated\n\u00a3'000\nCentral Europe\n246\n(614)\nSouthern Europe\n457\n(132)\nRest of World (including UK)\n229\n201\nTax charge / (credit)\n932\n(545)\nThe restatement of the 2024 tax values relates to a revaluation of uncertain tax position liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to tax levied by the same tax authority and where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Deferred tax assets, in respect of losses, are recognised up to the value of the fixed asset liability as the nature of the asset & liability is such that they unwind at the same time.\nThe deferred tax asset relating to the Germany defined benefit obligation has been recognised as the German entity is profit-making and paying tax to the German tax authorities.\nThe following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes:\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\nas restated\n\u00a3'000\nDeferred tax assets\n1,513\n1,578\nDeferred tax liabilities\n(68)\n(57)\n1,445\n1,521\nAs at 30 June 2025, the Group had approximately \u00a3196m of unutilised unrecognised UK tax losses (2024: approximately \u00a3167m) available for offset against future profits. At the UK's current rate of corporation tax the unutilised tax losses equate to a potential deferred tax asset of \u00a349.0m (2024: \u00a341.8m). The unrecognised deferred tax losses are stated after offset against taxable temporary differences of \u00a31.8m (2024: \u00a31.8m) as per IAS 12. The remaining \u00a347.2m (2024: \u00a340.0m) potential deferred tax asset is unrecognised at the balance sheet date together with \u00a32.6m (2024: \u00a32.3m) of other short term temporary timing differences and tax credits as there is not currently sufficient convincing evidence that taxable profits will be available against which these losses and other deductible temporary differences and tax credits will be utilised in the foreseeable future. Management reassesses the probable availability of future taxable profits on a regular basis.\nIt is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting these earnings to the UK. However, \u00a34.1m (\u20ac4.7m) of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed \u00a30.2m. No provision for a deferred tax liability has been recognised as the Group controls the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and has no plans to remit relevant earnings in the foreseeable future.\nRecognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at the tax rates expected to apply to the date when the liability is settled or asset realised.\nThe restatement of the 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2024 values relates to recognition of the deferred tax asset in relation to the Germany defined benefit obligation and retirement benefit asset as well as a number of smaller corrections. See Note 20 for details.\n10.

Investments - retirement benefit asset\nThe Group carries insurance policies which are designed to contribute towards the obligations in respect of the German defined benefit pension scheme (see Note 18). Some of these policies include a right to reimbursement and therefore do not meet the definition of a qualifying insurance policy under IAS 19.8.

Following discussions with the Shareholder Lenders, the Amended Loan Facility was amended again (\"the Amended Shareholder Facility\") on 15 October 2024.\nThe Amended Loan Facility provided the Group with a \u00a340.0m loan facility, secured against the shares held by Allergy Therapeutics plc in other Group companies (i.e. all the major assets of the Group), of which \u00a37.5m was committed from the outset and \u00a332.5m initially uncommitted. The Amended Loan Facility was available to drawn down from 15 January 2024 until 15 January 2026 with interest payable semi-annually at 12% per annum and a repayment date of 15 January 2027.\nThe Amended Shareholder Facility, increased the amount available, on an uncommitted basis, to \u00a350.0m. The facility was also amended to extend the term to 15 October 2030, to be unsecured and rank behind the Hayfin Facility and such that interest will no longer be paid and instead interest will be rolled up into capital, until the final year of the term when interest will again become payable semi-annually. The interest rate payable under the Amended Shareholder Facility remains 12% per annum.\nThe terms of the Amended Shareholder Facility are substantially different to the terms of the Amended Loan Facility, by virtue of the fact the discounted present value of the cash flows under the Amended Shareholder Facility (using the original effective interest rate under the Amended Loan Facility) are greater than 10% different to the carrying value of the Amended Loan Facility at the time of modification. A gain of \u00a30.4m arose on modification, representing the difference between extinguishment of the liability related to the Amended Loan Facility and the recognition of the liability related to the Amended Shareholder Facility.\nThe Company issues warrants to the Lenders following each drawdown under the Amended Shareholder Facility (and previously under the Amended Loan Facility), entitling the holders to subscribe for new Ordinary Shares at a price of 4 pence per share. The entitlement to warrants is 25 warrants for each \u00a31 drawn down up to a maximum of 1,375,000,000 warrants. The warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for new Ordinary Shares at a price of 4 pence per warrant. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part from 1 July 2024 until 15 October 2030. The Company has agreed that the proceeds of the warrants will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Amended Shareholder Facility.\nAt 30 June 2025, \u00a337.5m (2024: \u00a322.5m) of the Amended Shareholder Facility had been drawn (net of \u00a35.0m drawn in August 2024 and repaid in October 2024), of which \u00a34.4m (2024: \u00a31.3m) was allocated to the warrants on initial recognition (in line with the Group's accounting policy, the debt component was valued first by discounting the contractual cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument which did not include the warrants, the remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the warrants and recognised in the \"Warrants reserve\" within shareholders' equity). At 30 June 2025 a total of 1,062,500,000 warrants had been issued in relation to the Amended Shareholder Facility.\nSubsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group drew down the remaining \u00a312.5m available under the Amended Shareholder Facility and issued further warrants. The shareholders subsequently exercised their warrants and the proceeds were used by the Group to repay the shareholder loan in full. Full details can be found in Note 21.\nHayfin Facility\nOn 15 October 2024 the Group entered into a \u00a340m secured senior loan facility (the \"Hayfin Facility\") with Hayfin Healthcare Opportunities LuxCo S.a.r.l., a fund advised by Hayfin Capital Management LLP (\"Hayfin\"). The Hayfin Facility consists of a committed \u00a320m five year term loan and an additional uncommitted \u00a320m incremental facility. The Hayfin \u00a320m loan was subject to an upfront arrangement fee and has a variable interest rate based on SONIA plus 9.5% per annum with interest payable based on Company selected interest periods. To date only the \u00a320m committed facility has been drawn.\nAs part of these financing arrangements, the Company also issued to Hayfin an initial 131,603,616 warrants to subscribe for new ordinary shares, representing approximately 2.7% of the issued share capital of the Company, with a nominal exercise price of 0.1 pence per warrant and exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of issue. Subsequent to the initial issuance of warrants, up to 30 June 2025, the Company has issued a further 1,011,605 warrants to Hayfin on the same terms for no additional consideration, as a result of warrants issued to the Shareholder Lenders on drawdowns under the Amended Shareholder Facility and the anti-dilution clauses contained within the Hayfin warrants instrument. At 30 June 2025 a total of 132,615,221 warrants had been issued in relation to the Hayfin Facility. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, further warrants have been issued to Hayfin, see Note 21 for details.\nThe Hayfin Facility is repayable on 17 October 2029. The contract includes covenants requiring the Group to (a) maintain a prescribed minimum liquidity amount at all times, and (b) meet certain prescribed minimum gross sales targets, tested quarterly for the prior twelve-month period. If either covenant is not met then the loan agreement provides the option for the Group's major shareholders to provide new funding within a prescribed time limit as a cure. If sufficient funds are not provided as a cure by the prescribed time limit then the loan will be repayable on demand. For the period from inception of the loan up to 30 June 2025 the Group has complied with the covenants at all times, hence the loan is not repayable on demand and is classified as non-current. The Group has access to sufficient funding for at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements to ensure continued compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant. The Group's gross sales in the twelve-month period to 30 June 2025 were 12% in excess of the minimum covenant requirement and there is no increase in the gross sales required to meet this covenant until 30 June 2027.\n17.

Retirement benefit obligations\nDefined contribution scheme\nThe Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all employees in the UK except those that have opted out of the scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. A salary sacrifice scheme is in operation at Allergy Therapeutics (UK) Ltd. The effect of the scheme is to transfer a proportion of the payroll cost to pension contributions.\nDefined benefit scheme\nThe Group operates a partly funded non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees in Germany. The actuarial valuation was carried out by Mercer Deutschland GmbH at 30\u00a0June\u00a02025.\nThe assets and liabilities in the scheme were as follows:\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nFair value of plan assets\n972\n1,002\nPresent value of scheme liabilities\n(9,564)\n(9,613)\nDeficit in the scheme\n(8,592)\n(8,611)\nMovement in assets during the year\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nBalance as at 1 July\n1,002\n1,022\nForeign currency differences\n10\n(14)\nInterest income on plan assets\n37\n47\nRemeasurement of defined benefit asset\n6\n32\nContributions from employer\n-\n-\nAssets transferred to finance benefits paid\n(83)\n(85)\nBalance as at 30 June\n972\n1,002\nMovement in liabilities in the year\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nBalance as at 1 July\n(9,613)\n(8,939)\nForeign currency differences\n(99)\n136\nCurrent service costs\n(112)\n(122)\nInterest cost\n(360)\n(364)\nRemeasurement of defined benefit liability - arising from changes in financial assumptions and experience gains/(losses)\n271\n(649)\nBenefits paid by employer\n266\n240\nBenefits paid from assets\n83\n85\nBalance as at 30 June\n(9,564)\n(9,613)\n19.

Prior period adjustments\nUncertain tax positions\nThe 2024 liability was restated to recognise discussions that took place between the Group and a tax authority, where a number of material uncertainties were resolved, leading to a lower settlement than the Group had previously provided for. Although this meeting took place after the balance sheet date it was before the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 were approved and provided evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period and hence should have been considered an adjusting post balance sheet event.\nThe impact of the restatement on the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 30 June 2024 and the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2024 is shown below. There was no impact from this restatement on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2023.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nAlthough the overall Group is currently loss making the German subsidiary is profitable and pays tax to the German tax authorities, hence it is probable that taxable profits will be available to support the recognition of deferred tax assets arising in Germany. This was also the case in prior periods and therefore deferred tax assets relating to the Germany defined benefit obligation and retirement benefit investment asset should have been recognised. A number of smaller corrections to deferred tax assets and liabilities were made at the same time.\nThe impact of the restatement on the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2024 and the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 is shown below.\nCurrent tax receivables and payables\nAs required by IFRS/IAS1, current tax receivables are now disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Events after the balance sheet date\nProceeds from Exercise of Warrants and Repayment of the Entire Balance under the Shareholder Facility\nBetween the balance sheet date and 20 October 2025, the Group drew down \u00a312.5m under the Amended Shareholder Facility and issued further warrants in accordance with the entitlement to 25 warrants for each \u00a31 drawn, at a price of 4 pence per share. Along with previous drawdowns the entire amount of the Amended Shareholder Facility has now been drawn and a total of 1,375,000,000 warrants issued.\nOn 29 October 2025, the Company received exercise notices from the Shareholder Lenders in respect of the 1,375,000,000 warrants, which would generate aggregate proceeds of \u00a355m on exercise. In satisfaction of the exercise price payable by the Shareholder Lenders for the warrants, the Shareholder Lenders have transferred the entire Amended Shareholder Facility to the Company along with net proceeds of \u00a31m in cash. As a result, all financial indebtedness owed by the Group to the Shareholder Lenders under the Amended Shareholder Facility, has effectively been repaid. The net proceeds of \u00a31m paid to the Company in cash, represents the difference between the \u00a355m warrant exercise proceeds and the amounts owed by the Group to the Shareholder Lenders at the point of exercise of \u00a354m, including all capitalised and accrued interest.\n1,375,000,000 new Ordinary Shares were issued to the Shareholder Lenders following exercise of their warrants, which rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares in issue. Following issue of the new Ordinary Shares, the Company's total issued and voting share capital consists of 6,141,439,951 Ordinary Shares.\nAs a result of the drawdowns under the Amended Shareholder Facility between the balance sheet date and 20 October 2025 (and issuance of the related warrants to the Shareholder Lenders), the Company has also issued 843,005 warrants with an exercise price of 0.1 pence per warrant to Hayfin Healthcare Opportunities LuxCo S.a.r.l., a fund advised by Hayfin Capital Management LLP (\"Hayfin\") pursuant to anti-dilution rights held by Hayfin under the terms of the warrants issued to Hayfin in connection with the senior secured loan facility entered into between Hayfin and the Company dated 15 October 2024.\nRenewed Shareholder Facility\nThe Lenders have agreed to provide a new \u00a350m unsecured loan facility (the \"Renewed Shareholder Facility\") on an uncommitted basis. The Renewed Shareholder Facility is available to draw down from 29 October 2025 until 15 July 2030, with interest payable at 12 per cent. per annum and a repayment date of 15 October 2030. There are no warrants attached to the drawdown of the facility extended under the Renewed Shareholder Facility.\nExploration of listing in Hong Kong\nPost year end it was announced to the London Stock Exchange that the Group is exploring a potential dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, alongside our existing listing in London. This is a strategic move that reflects our ambition to expand Allergy Therapeutics' presence in Asia and to strengthen our position as a global leader in allergy immunotherapy.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
