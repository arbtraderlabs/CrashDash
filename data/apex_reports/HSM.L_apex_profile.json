However, the order intake has been below budget since June 2025 which will affect trading in the second half of the year (as discussed below). Operating profit was \u00a3489k compared to \u00a3481k in the six months to 30 September 2024, an \u00a38k increase.\nThe increase in national insurance contributions and minimum wage affect a labour-intensive business like ours considerably, but we are pleased to have increased profit before tax by \u00a3103k to \u00a3542k (\u00a3439k six months to 30 September 2024) during the first half of this year. Tariffs on our sales to the USA are reflected in our turnover, however this cost has been fully passed on to our customers.\nCash and cash equivalents at 30 September 2025 increased by \u00a3454k to \u00a32.62m, from \u00a32.17m as at\n31 March 2025. Working capital was largely unchanged overall, although management of stock reduced inventory by \u00a3209k. Plant expenditure of \u00a334k was incurred to support production efficiency and productivity. Product development costs of \u00a3175k (\u00a3150k six months to 30 September 2024) were also incurred and capitalised.\nThe Company's contribution to the defined benefit pension scheme stood at \u00a3nil (six months to 30 September 2024: \u00a3nil).\nThe pension scheme surplus was \u00a3701k (\u00a3526k net of deferred tax) valued under the IAS 19 rules. The scheme continues to be heavily invested in fixed income securities to match movements in assets and liabilities and minimise risk. The status is being regularly monitored to be able to take advantage of a possible buy-out opportunity should it arise. Currently, a significant premium would be required, and it is not believed that a buy-out will be affordable in the near future.\nLooking to the second half of the year, the Board has concerns about the economic environment in its two key markets. As mentioned, the order intake from June 2025 has been significantly below budget. Although the UK has secured a USA tariff level at the lower end of the scale, our brassware is only part of a bathroom and other product costs have risen as much as 50%, causing overall construction costs to increase substantially. Many customers have pressed on regardless, but we have seen some pausing of projects while assessments are made of the budget revisions required. In the UK, current and pending changes to inheritance tax and income tax in November 2025's budget has led to some of our clients moving overseas and others waiting to see what happens next. This has led to a degree of caution especially in the London market. The double effects of tariffs and tax increases have led the Company to take action and reduce headcount and costs in anticipation of a tougher second half year and into the next financial year.\nThe Company is pleased to report that the introduction of four key new finishes, including Anthracite and Old Brass, has met with expectations and are selling well. Events such as Milan and Wow!house in Chelsea Harbour have helped increase our profile with premium interior designers and we feel well placed to mitigate the worst of the events mentioned above to a degree. However, we are expecting sales to be weaker in the second half of the year which will have an impact on our final year profit. Next year will see the launch of our Octelle collection, which is a collaboration with the esteemed interior designer, Laura Hammett which we expect to gain us new sales in our key markets.\nAnthony Buttanshaw\nChair\n26 November 2025\nDividend\nAs a result of the uncertain trading conditions, the directors recommend the same interim dividend as last year at 4.5p per share (2024: 4.5p). The interim dividend will be paid on 20 March 2026 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13 February 2026. The ex-dividend date for this payment is 12 February 2026.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF INTERIM REPORT\nAs permitted, IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting' has not been applied in this interim report. The information for the period ended 30 September 2025 is not audited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were given an unqualified audit report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The interim accounts for the half year ended 30 September 2024 were also unaudited.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of accounting\nThe report has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.\nThe group has not availed itself of early adoption options in standards and interpretations.\nThe principal accounting policies adopted are as set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. The valuation of inventories is considered to be the main area in terms of significant accounting estimates and judgements.\nThe retirement benefit scheme surplus recognised in these interim accounts reflects the estimated change in the surplus at 30 September 2025 from the movements in discount rates and inflation during the six months.\n3. DIVIDENDS\nA final dividend for the financial year 2025 of 8.5625p per share (2024: 8.5625p) was paid during the period.\nAn Interim dividend for the financial year 2026 of 4.5p per share is proposed (2025: 4.5p), payable on 20 March 2026.\n4. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the relevant profit after taxation of \u00a3542,000 (2024: profit \u00a3411,000) by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period being 2,534,322 (2024: 2,534,322). The number of shares used in the calculation is the same for both basic and diluted earnings.\n5. OTHER OPERATING INCOME\nIncome was recognised for the financial year 2025 through the gaining of tax credits under the Research and Development tax regime.\nHalf year ended 30 September\nHalf year ended 30 September\nYear ended 31 March\n2025\n2024\n2025\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nR&D Expenditure Credits\n-\n-\n61\nTotal other operating income\n-\n-\n18\nIncome has been accounted for under the accruals method.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORT (cont.)\n6.\nRETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEME\nThe values used in the Financial Statements are valued using IAS 19, which shows a surplus of \u00a3701k\n(shown in the balance sheet as \u00a3526k net of deferred tax). However, the Director's support the goal of a Buyout for the Scheme which is likely to result in a premium being paid to the insurance company. This would mean that the Directors do not expect this asset to be realised or ultimately distributable.\nContributions for the year to 31 March 2026 have been agreed at nil (2025: \u00a3300,000).\nNote:\nCertain statements made in this announcement are forward-looking statements.

Sales for the year ended at \u00a314.769m compared to \u00a315.237m in 2024, a decrease of \u00a3468k. The reduction was due to the factors mentioned at the half year: namely worsened economic conditions partly caused by the UK budget and the US Presidential elections. Our gross profit margin for the year came in at 46.3% (46.6% in 2024).\nManagement reviewed production staffing levels, sales & marketing activity and other costs which, together with a reduction in energy bills, helped improve operating profit to \u00a31.026m (6.9% return on sales) compared to \u00a3832k (5.5%) last year an increase of \u00a3226k. Profit after tax was \u00a3888k (2024: \u00a3768k). Selling and distribution costs reduced by 6.6% and administrative overheads decreased by 6.5% compared to prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2025 increased by \u00a3485k to \u00a32.169m, from \u00a31.684m at 31 March 2024.\nNet Assets increased to \u00a312.30m (2024: \u00a312.18m), net of the \u00a3150k reduction in pension surplus discussed below.\nThe pension scheme remains in surplus and Company contributions were reduced by \u00a3609k to \u00a3300k (2024: \u00a3909k) after agreement with the scheme's trustees. Although the asset values have reduced in value in line with the markets, the discount rate has remained strong, reducing liabilities. In IAS19 accounting terms, a surplus has been recorded of \u00a3823k (2024: \u00a31.02m); however, the Directors wish to highlight, as previously, that it is both their and the Trustees' aim to move the scheme to a Buyout once it is viable and affordable to do so. Therefore, any surplus recognised is unlikely ever to become distributable. The latest balance, net of the related deferred tax liability, is a surplus of \u00a3617k compared to \u00a3767k in 2024, a reduction of \u00a3150k.\nOutlook\nThe start of the new financial year in April 2025 saw the imposition of tariffs by the US administration which created volatility in a key export market, as well as weakening the dollar in relation to sterling. The Company has however been successful in passing on in full the current 10% tariff level. Employment costs have risen higher than initially forecast due to the unexpected lowering of the national insurance threshold. We are also seeing evidence of the UK luxury market being affected by tax changes impacting on high net-worth individuals and families.\nOn the positive, the Company's continued product development, both in new finishes and specific fittings, is helping us outperform in a difficult market overall. In 2025, we have commenced new marketing ventures, such as joining the Fuorisalone Design Week at the Brera Design District in Milan and a collaboration with a high profile British interior designer at Wow!house in the Design Centre at Chelsea Harbour. We also organised VIP events for specifiers in North America, all of which are helping us reach a wider customer base. Further new markets are under development and should contribute new sales this financial year.\nDespite changes at the macro level the Board is cautiously optimistic for the current year.\nThe directors recommend maintaining the final dividend at 8.5625p, which will be paid on 26 September 2025 to shareholders registered as at 22 August 2025, the ex-dividend date for the payment is 21 August 2025. This will bring the total declared for the year (Interim and Final) to 13.0625p per share or \u00a3331k (2024: \u00a3305k).\nAnthony Buttanshaw\nNon-Executive Chair\n24 July 2025\nThis announcement

Basis of preparation\nThe Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those included in the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2024.\nThe financial information contained in this preliminary announcement does not constitute the Group's statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 24 July 2025 along with this preliminary announcement. The annual report and financial statements will be\ndelivered to the Registrar of Companies after the Annual General Meeting.\nThe statutory accounts of Samuel Heath & Sons PLC for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's reports on the statutory accounts for the years ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024 were unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n2.\nKey areas of judgment and sources of estimation uncertainty\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The Group has evaluated the estimates and assumptions that have been made in relation to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial statements.\nThe key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty with a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12 months include the following:\nPensions\n- movements in equity markets, interest rates and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in the defined benefit pension scheme. The key assumptions used to value pension assets and liabilities are set out in note 23 \"Retirement benefit scheme\". Where a surplus on a defined benefit scheme arises, the rights of the Trustees to prevent the Group obtaining a refund of that surplus in the future are considered in determining whether it is necessary to restrict the amount of the surplus that is recognised. The Retirement benefit scheme is in surplus at 31 March 2025. The directors have made the judgement that these amounts meet the requirements of recoverability and a gross surplus of \u00a3823k (\u00a3617k net) has been recognised.\nValuation of property, plant and equipment\n- the Group reviews the value, useful economic lives and residual values attributed to assets on an on-going basis to ensure they are appropriate. Changes in market value, economic lives or residual values could impact the carrying value and charges to the income statement in future periods.\nProvisions\n-\nusing information available at the balance sheet date, the Directors make judgements based on experience on the level of provision required against assets. Provisions are initially determined by evaluating the expected sales of each inventory line over the subsequent 12-month period. No provision is made for inventory expected to be sold within this timeframe. Where no sales are anticipated, a 100% provision is made. The Directors subsequently review the initial provisions and adjust them manually, particularly in cases involving inventory acquired within the past 12 months, or where a minimum order quantity is greater than the expected use over a 12-month period.

The order book held up reasonably well despite adverse market conditions in the UK, where market intelligence suggested order volumes were generally down around 20%. However, the October 2024 order intake was significantly below budget (as discussed below).\nOperating profit was \u00a3481k which compares with \u00a3465k in the six months to 30 September 2023, a \u00a316k increase despite the \u00a3260k sales reduction. The small improvement in margin reflected labour savings and lower utility costs, as well as lower advertising and trade show costs.\nCash and cash equivalents at 30 September 2024 increased by \u00a3253k to \u00a31.937m, from \u00a31.684m as at 31 March 2024. Working capital reduced by \u00a3130k (mainly lower stocks), while plant expenditure of \u00a3319k was incurred to support production efficiency and productivity. However, a significant factor was the absence of a contribution to the defined benefit pension scheme (six months to 30 September 2023: \u00a3300k).\nAs mentioned in the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2024, the board has agreed with the pension trustees that the company contribution would be reduced to \u00a3300k in the year to 31 March 2025. This newly agreed level will be paid in the second half of the current financial year. Also as previously indicated, the trustees were asked to request a formal valuation at 31 March 2024 and this has now been completed. Using conservative assumptions, the report shows a surplus of \u00a3572k on an ongoing basis. In addition, the scheme assets have been transferred to a new fiduciary manager and invested such as to match the performance of assets and liabilities, with the intention of being able to buy out the fund in due course (note the scheme currently has a deficit on a 'solvency' basis).\nLooking to the second half of the year, the Board has concerns about the economic environment and the state of the markets. As already mentioned, the order intake in October 2024 was significantly below budget and compared to previous months. Up until then, we appeared to be gaining some market share, against a background of depressed markets in the UK.\nConcerns about the UK government's budget, combined with anticipation of the US election result, contributed to a marked slowdown in order intake which has been evident in the market for several months. With both major events now concluded, we are hopeful that projects that have been on hold will now resume, though this may take several months to reach us in the form of confirmed orders.\nThe Company is pleased to report that the Forme Collection, launched 18 months ago, is selling ahead of budget and should continue to do so. This year has seen the introduction of four key new finishes, with Anthracite and Old Brass shown for the first time at the recent Decorex London exhibition to a very positive audience. New finishes, as we have seen with the recent Antique Brass Matt, can be a significant driver of sales.\nAnthony Buttanshaw\nChair\n26 November 2024\nDividend\nAs a result of the uncertain trading conditions, the directors recommend the same interim dividend as last year at 4.5p per share (2023: 4.5p). The interim dividend will be paid on 21 March 2025 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 21 February 2025. The ex-dividend date for this payment is 20 February 2025.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSamuel Heath & Sons Plc\nSimon Latham, Company Secretary 0121 766 4200\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nJames

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF INTERIM REPORT\nAs permitted, IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting' has not been applied in this interim report. The information for the period ended 30 September 2024 is not audited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 were given an unqualified audit report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The interim accounts for the half year ended 30 September 2023 were also unaudited.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of accounting\nThe report has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.\nThe group has not availed itself of early adoption options in standards and interpretations.\nThe principal accounting policies adopted are as set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2024. The valuation of inventories is considered to be the main area in terms of significant accounting estimates and judgements.\nThe retirement benefit scheme surplus recognised in these interim accounts reflects the estimated change in the surplus at 30 September 2024 from the movements in discount rates and inflation during the six months.\n3. DIVIDENDS\nA final dividend for the financial year 2024 of 8.5625p per share (2023: 7.5625p) was paid during the period.\nAn Interim dividend for the financial year 2025 of 4.5p per share is proposed (2024: 4.5p), payable on 21 March 2025.\n4. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the relevant profit after taxation of \u00a3411,000 (2023: profit \u00a3411,000) by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period being 2,534,322 (2023: 2,534,322). The number of shares used in the calculation is the same for both basic and diluted earnings.\n5. OTHER OPERATING INCOME\nIncome was received for the financial year 2024 from RTC North in the form of Grant Funding, supporting the Feasibility of Automated Unloading.\nHalf year ended 30 September\nHalf year ended 30 September\nYear ended 31 March\n2024\n2023\n2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRTC North grant income\n-\n-\n18\nTotal other operating income\n-\n-\n18\nIncome has been accounted for under the accruals method.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORT (cont.)\n6.\nRETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEME\nThe values used in the Financial Statements are valued using IAS 19, which shows a surplus of \u00a31.255m\n(shown in the balance sheet as \u00a3941k net of deferred tax). However, the Director's support the goal of a Buyout for the Scheme which is likely to result in a premium being paid to the insurance company. This would mean that the Directors do not expect this asset to be realised or ultimately distributable.\nContributions for the year to 31 March 2025 have been agreed at \u00a3300,000, which have yet to be paid.\nNote:\nCertain statements made in this announcement are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on the Company's current expectations, estimates, and projections about its industry; its beliefs; and assumptions.
