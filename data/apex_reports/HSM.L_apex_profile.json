Sales revenue was up to \u00a36,635,000 (2015: \u00a36,061,000). Operating profit was also up at \u00a3832,000 (2015: \u00a3542,000). Profit before tax was \u00a3728,000 (2015: \u00a3437,000). This general improvement took place in most markets in which we operate and was fairly evenly spread over most of our product groups.\nIt is with great sadness that I report that in August our Financial Director, Paul Turner, died after a short illness at the age of 49. He had made a large contribution to the Company during his nine years with us.\nI have said before that the job for businesses is to work in the circumstances they are given and not to expect to change them. We equally hope to be interfered with as little as possible as a trade off to this.\nThe immediate future and long term outlook is going to be affected by the current uncertain situation. Seventy-five per cent of our purchases are being impacted by the devaluation of the Pound against the Dollar and the Euro. Our main purchase of brass is directly hit by both these currencies. Our sterling prices are therefore going to have to rise. It is always difficult to foresee the acceptance of these new prices, particularly since, in the current circumstances, increases of competitors are going to be phased in haphazardly.\nPerhaps also, longer term, the health of our business will be very dependent on the prosperity being enjoyed in London and the South East. It is for these reasons that I am extremely cautious in forecasting the results for the second six months of the year. Experience tells us that there can be rapid changes in spending patterns.\nThe Bank of England decided to lower interest rates after the Brexit vote. This has had an immediate impact on our pension scheme deficit. This now stands at \u00a310,805,000, as against \u00a35,292,000 at the end of September 2015. Since we are allowed only to pay dividends when total assets exceed liabilities, we are prevented from paying a dividend at this time. If the position changes by the year end, we hope to make up for this lack of payment at that time. Meanwhile I find it extremely ironic that this situation has arisen, when the Company is announcing its record operating profit before tax at the interim stage in the forty-five years, in which I have been Chairman. I can only add that increased spending in order to keep the economy moving is unlikely to be carried out by Samuel Heath and Sons shareholders.\nSam Heath\nChairman\n16th November 2016\nFor further

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF INTERIM REPORT\nAs permitted, IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting' has not been applied in this interim report. The information for the period ended 30 September 2016 is not audited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 were given an unqualified audit report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The interim accounts for the half year ended 30 September 2015 were also unaudited.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of accounting\nThe report has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") at 30 September 2016 as well as all interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\") at 30 September 2016.\nThe group has not availed itself of early adoption options in such standards and interpretations.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are as set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016. The valuation of inventories is considered to be the main area in terms of significant accounting estimates and judgements.\nThe retirement benefit scheme liability recognised in these interim accounts reflects the estimated change in the deficit at 30 September 2016 from the movements in discount rates and inflation during the six months.\n3. Dividends\nNo interim dividend is proposed (30 September 2015: 5.5 pence per share).\n4. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the relevant profit after taxation of \u00a3579,000 (30 September 2015: \u00a3350,000) by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period being 2,534,322\n(2015: 2,534,322). The number of shares used in the calculation is the same for both basic and diluted earnings.\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nIR BLBDBLUBBGLU"

Sales for the year ended at \u00a314.769m compared to \u00a315.237m in 2024, a decrease of \u00a3468k. The reduction was due to the factors mentioned at the half year: namely worsened economic conditions partly caused by the UK budget and the US Presidential elections. Our gross profit margin for the year came in at 46.3% (46.6% in 2024).\nManagement reviewed production staffing levels, sales & marketing activity and other costs which, together with a reduction in energy bills, helped improve operating profit to \u00a31.026m (6.9% return on sales) compared to \u00a3832k (5.5%) last year an increase of \u00a3226k. Profit after tax was \u00a3888k (2024: \u00a3768k). Selling and distribution costs reduced by 6.6% and administrative overheads decreased by 6.5% compared to prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2025 increased by \u00a3485k to \u00a32.169m, from \u00a31.684m at 31 March 2024.\nNet Assets increased to \u00a312.30m (2024: \u00a312.18m), net of the \u00a3150k reduction in pension surplus discussed below.\nThe pension scheme remains in surplus and Company contributions were reduced by \u00a3609k to \u00a3300k (2024: \u00a3909k) after agreement with the scheme's trustees. Although the asset values have reduced in value in line with the markets, the discount rate has remained strong, reducing liabilities. In IAS19 accounting terms, a surplus has been recorded of \u00a3823k (2024: \u00a31.02m); however, the Directors wish to highlight, as previously, that it is both their and the Trustees' aim to move the scheme to a Buyout once it is viable and affordable to do so. Therefore, any surplus recognised is unlikely ever to become distributable. The latest balance, net of the related deferred tax liability, is a surplus of \u00a3617k compared to \u00a3767k in 2024, a reduction of \u00a3150k.\nOutlook\nThe start of the new financial year in April 2025 saw the imposition of tariffs by the US administration which created volatility in a key export market, as well as weakening the dollar in relation to sterling. The Company has however been successful in passing on in full the current 10% tariff level. Employment costs have risen higher than initially forecast due to the unexpected lowering of the national insurance threshold. We are also seeing evidence of the UK luxury market being affected by tax changes impacting on high net-worth individuals and families.\nOn the positive, the Company's continued product development, both in new finishes and specific fittings, is helping us outperform in a difficult market overall. In 2025, we have commenced new marketing ventures, such as joining the Fuorisalone Design Week at the Brera Design District in Milan and a collaboration with a high profile British interior designer at Wow!house in the Design Centre at Chelsea Harbour. We also organised VIP events for specifiers in North America, all of which are helping us reach a wider customer base. Further new markets are under development and should contribute new sales this financial year.\nDespite changes at the macro level the Board is cautiously optimistic for the current year.\nThe directors recommend maintaining the final dividend at 8.5625p, which will be paid on 26 September 2025 to shareholders registered as at 22 August 2025, the ex-dividend date for the payment is 21 August 2025. This will bring the total declared for the year (Interim and Final) to 13.0625p per share or \u00a3331k (2024: \u00a3305k).\nAnthony Buttanshaw\nNon-Executive Chair\n24 July 2025\nThis announcement

Basis of preparation\nThe Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those included in the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2024.\nThe financial information contained in this preliminary announcement does not constitute the Group's statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 24 July 2025 along with this preliminary announcement. The annual report and financial statements will be\ndelivered to the Registrar of Companies after the Annual General Meeting.\nThe statutory accounts of Samuel Heath & Sons PLC for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's reports on the statutory accounts for the years ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024 were unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n2.\nKey areas of judgment and sources of estimation uncertainty\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The Group has evaluated the estimates and assumptions that have been made in relation to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial statements.\nThe key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty with a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12 months include the following:\nPensions\n- movements in equity markets, interest rates and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in the defined benefit pension scheme. The key assumptions used to value pension assets and liabilities are set out in note 23 \"Retirement benefit scheme\". Where a surplus on a defined benefit scheme arises, the rights of the Trustees to prevent the Group obtaining a refund of that surplus in the future are considered in determining whether it is necessary to restrict the amount of the surplus that is recognised. The Retirement benefit scheme is in surplus at 31 March 2025. The directors have made the judgement that these amounts meet the requirements of recoverability and a gross surplus of \u00a3823k (\u00a3617k net) has been recognised.\nValuation of property, plant and equipment\n- the Group reviews the value, useful economic lives and residual values attributed to assets on an on-going basis to ensure they are appropriate. Changes in market value, economic lives or residual values could impact the carrying value and charges to the income statement in future periods.\nProvisions\n-\nusing information available at the balance sheet date, the Directors make judgements based on experience on the level of provision required against assets. Provisions are initially determined by evaluating the expected sales of each inventory line over the subsequent 12-month period. No provision is made for inventory expected to be sold within this timeframe. Where no sales are anticipated, a 100% provision is made. The Directors subsequently review the initial provisions and adjust them manually, particularly in cases involving inventory acquired within the past 12 months, or where a minimum order quantity is greater than the expected use over a 12-month period. The stock provision at year end was \u00a33.240m (2024: \u00a33.287m).\nResearch and development\n- the Group reviews the projects worked on during the year and capitalises the costs of those projects deemed to generate profits in future years, \u00a3350,000 was capitalised in the year (2024: \u00a3354,000). The Company takes full advantage of available taxation support.\n3. Revenue by geographic market\n2025\n\u00a3000\n2024\n\u00a3000\nOverseas\n7,348\n7,316\nUK\n7,421\n7,921\n14,769\n15,237\n4.

Dividends\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nFinal dividend for the year ended 31 March 2024 of 8.5625 pence per share (2023: 7.5625 pence per share)\n218\n192\nInterim dividend for the year ended 31st March 2025 of 4.50 pence per share (2024: 5.50 pence per share)\n113\n113\n331\n305\nThe directors are recommending a final dividend for 2025 of 8.5625 pence per share amounting to \u00a3218,000. The proposed final dividend is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting and hence has not been included as a liability in these accounts.\n6. Earnings per share\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the relevant profit after taxation of \u00a3888,000 (2024: \u00a3768,000) by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year being 2,534,322 (2024: 2,534,322). The number of shares used in the calculation is the same for both basic and diluted earnings.\n7. Notice of annual general meeting\nNotice is hereby given that the 2025 Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the registered office of the Company, Leopold Street, Birmingham, on 11 September 2025 at 12.00 noon.\n8. Posting of accounts\nThe report and accounts are being posted to shareholders today where requested, and are available on the Company's website, at\nwww.samuel-heath.com/investor-relations\n.\nNote\n:\nCertain statements made in this announcement are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on the Company's current expectations, estimates, and projections about its industry; its beliefs; and assumptions.

Sales revenue was up to \u00a36,635,000 (2015: \u00a36,061,000). Operating profit was also up at \u00a3832,000 (2015: \u00a3542,000). Profit before tax was \u00a3728,000 (2015: \u00a3437,000). This general improvement took place in most markets in which we operate and was fairly evenly spread over most of our product groups.\nIt is with great sadness that I report that in August our Financial Director, Paul Turner, died after a short illness at the age of 49. He had made a large contribution to the Company during his nine years with us.\nI have said before that the job for businesses is to work in the circumstances they are given and not to expect to change them. We equally hope to be interfered with as little as possible as a trade off to this.\nThe immediate future and long term outlook is going to be affected by the current uncertain situation. Seventy-five per cent of our purchases are being impacted by the devaluation of the Pound against the Dollar and the Euro. Our main purchase of brass is directly hit by both these currencies. Our sterling prices are therefore going to have to rise. It is always difficult to foresee the acceptance of these new prices, particularly since, in the current circumstances, increases of competitors are going to be phased in haphazardly.\nPerhaps also, longer term, the health of our business will be very dependent on the prosperity being enjoyed in London and the South East. It is for these reasons that I am extremely cautious in forecasting the results for the second six months of the year. Experience tells us that there can be rapid changes in spending patterns.\nThe Bank of England decided to lower interest rates after the Brexit vote. This has had an immediate impact on our pension scheme deficit. This now stands at \u00a310,805,000, as against \u00a35,292,000 at the end of September 2015. Since we are allowed only to pay dividends when total assets exceed liabilities, we are prevented from paying a dividend at this time. If the position changes by the year end, we hope to make up for this lack of payment at that time. Meanwhile I find it extremely ironic that this situation has arisen, when the Company is announcing its record operating profit before tax at the interim stage in the forty-five years, in which I have been Chairman. I can only add that increased spending in order to keep the economy moving is unlikely to be carried out by Samuel Heath and Sons shareholders.\nSam Heath\nChairman\n16th November 2016\nFor further

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF INTERIM REPORT\nAs permitted, IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting' has not been applied in this interim report. The information for the period ended 30 September 2016 is not audited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 were given an unqualified audit report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The interim accounts for the half year ended 30 September 2015 were also unaudited.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of accounting\nThe report has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") at 30 September 2016 as well as all interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\") at 30 September 2016.\nThe group has not availed itself of early adoption options in such standards and interpretations.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are as set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016. The valuation of inventories is considered to be the main area in terms of significant accounting estimates and judgements.\nThe retirement benefit scheme liability recognised in these interim accounts reflects the estimated change in the deficit at 30 September 2016 from the movements in discount rates and inflation during the six months.\n3. Dividends\nNo interim dividend is proposed (30 September 2015: 5.5 pence per share).\n4. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the relevant profit after taxation of \u00a3579,000 (30 September 2015: \u00a3350,000) by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period being 2,534,322\n(2015: 2,534,322). The number of shares used in the calculation is the same for both basic and diluted earnings.\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nIR BLBDBLUBBGLU"
