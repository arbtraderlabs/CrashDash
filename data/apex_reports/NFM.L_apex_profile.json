The Company has undertaken rare earth distribution analysis of 25 rock chip samples from the primary Cusp and Bobs Prospects at the Harts Range Project, which is located 140km north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The initial key findings show high-value, heavy rare earths in particular Dysprosium Oxide (11.75%) and Terbium Oxide (1.87%), underscoring substantial exploration potential.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nAnalysis of samples from Cusp and Bobs Prospects reveals a dominance towards high-value, Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE)\n\u00b7\nResults highlighting up to 11.75% Dysprosium Oxide and 1.87% Terbium Oxide within the Total Rare Earth Element (TREO) mix\n\u00b7\nUS tariffs have resulted in China restricting exports of seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths-namely Samarium, Gadolinium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Lutetium, Scandium, and Yttrium-related items, commencing 4 April, 202510\n\u00b7\nThe demand for rare earth elements continues to grow due to their critical role in various industries including defence and high-tech industries:\no\nThe development of domestic supply chains by the US Department of Defence (DOD) to ensure continued access to rare earth materials needed for permanent magnets used in key U.S. military weapons\nGed Hall, Chairman, commented:\n\"The initial analysis at the Cusp and Bobs Prospects of the Harts Range Project has revealed a strong dominance of heavy rare earth elements, in particular Dysprosium and Terbium, which is highly encouraging.\nChina's recent announcement to restrict the export of these critical heavy rare earths highlights the urgent need for alternative sources of supply.\nThese elements are essential for defence applications and are predominantly supplied and controlled by China, making their availability increasingly rare and strategically important. New Frontier is well-placed to seize this unique opportunity to explore and develop new sources of heavy rare earths at the Harts Range Project.\"\nDOMINANT HEAVY RARE EARTH DISTRIBUTION\nRare earth distribution analysis was undertaken on 13 mineralised rock chip samples (Appendix A) from the outcropping pegmatite at the Cusp Prospect. Using a Rare Earth Oxide (REO) average of the 13 samples, analysis has confirmed the mineralisation at Cusp to be consistently skewed and dominant towards Heavy Rare Earths (HRE).\nFigure 1: Distribution of Dysprosium and Terbium rich mineralisation at Cusp Prospect\nThe rare earth sample distribution at Cusp is particularly rich in Dysprosium (11.76%, Dy2O3) and Terbium (1.18%, Tb4O7), with a rare earth basket that comprises over 92% heavy rare earth minerals (Figure 1). The combined Dysprosium and Terbium distribution at the Cusp Prospect makes up 13.63% of the total rare earth oxide (TREO) basket mix.\nDistribution analysis was also undertaken at the Bobs Prospect, using a Rare Earth Oxide (REO) average of 12 mineralised rock chip samples (Appendix A) from the outcropping pegmatites. Like Cusp, the distribution analysis at Bobs has confirmed a high concentration of Heavy Rare Earths (HRE) mineralisation, particularly rich in Dysprosium (Dy) and Terbium (Tb) (Figure 2).\nThe rare earth distribution at Bobs showed higher Yttrium (71.06%, Y2O3) while still rich in heavy lanthanides Dysprosium (8.75%, Dy2O3) and Terbium (1.18%, Tb4O7). The overall heavy rare earth basket mix at Bobs was higher, comprising over 97% heavy rare earths.\nThe combined Dysprosium and Terbium distribution at the Bobs Prospect makes up 9.93% of the total rare earth oxide (TREO) basket mix.\nThe Bobs Prospect is located 1.6km along strike from Cusp and sits on the same major east-west trending structure, with similar mineralisation and geological setting.\nFigure 2: Distribution of Dysprosium and Terbium rich mineralisation at Bobs Prospect\nINTRODUCTION TO RARE EARTH ELEMENTS\nRare earths are a group of 15 elements in the periodic table known as the Lanthanide series. They are categorised into Light Rare Earths (Lanthanum to Samarium) and Heavy Rare Earths (Europium to Lutetium)4 but can also include Yttrium and Scandium.\nAlthough rare earth elements are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust, their geochemical properties cause them to be widely dispersed. As a result, they are rarely found in economically viable concentrations. This scarcity of easily accessible deposits is what earned them the name \"rare earths\".\nRare earth elements are critical for technologies aimed at reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and improving efficiency, performance, speed, durability, and thermal stability. They also play a vital role in advancing technologies aimed at making products lighter and more compact4.\nDYSPROSIUM AND TERBIUM RARE EARTH PRICES\nAs of 4 April, 2025, Shanghai Metals Market7 have quoted the average market prices for Dysprosium and Terbium rare earths as follows:\nDysprosium (Metal): US$253.13/kg7\nTerbium (Metal): US$983.45/kg7\nTHE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF HEAVY RARE EARTH ELEMENTS IN PERMANENT MAGNETS\nHeavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs) are crucial for enhancing the performance of Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets, which already rely on Light Rare Earth Elements like Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr).\nThe incorporation of Dysprosium (Dy) and Terbium (Tb) into NdFeB magnets significantly improves their coercive strength and increases resistance to demagnetisation at elevated temperatures2. This enables electric vehicle motors to operate at much higher temperatures compared to magnets lacking Dy and Tb. This capability is crucial for ensuring the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles in diverse operating conditions.\nGLOBAL DEMAND FOR DYSPROSIUM: GROWTH OUTLOOK AND MARKET TRENDS\nThe global demand for Dysprosium reached USD 1,002.2 million in 2024 and is anticipated to grow by 4.9% year-over-year in 2025, bringing total revenue to USD 1,054.3 million by the end of the year. Looking ahead, this demand is expected to surge to USD 1,750.3 million by 2035, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% during the forecast period from 2025 to 20351.\nThe steady growth in demand for Dysprosium is driven by its increasing demand across a variety of industries. As a vital component in the production of high-performance magnets, Dysprosium plays a pivotal role in advancing technologies that are essential to modern industries.\nDysprosium is most widely used in Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets, which are critical for applications in Electric Vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, consumer electronics and other high-tech products.\nAs the demand for cleaner energy solutions and more efficient technologies grows, Dysprosium's role in driving these innovations is becoming more significant.\nCHINA'S DOMINANCE IN GLOBAL HREE SUPPLY AND REFINING CAPACITY\nChina controls 90% of global rare earth processing capacity, including its HREE supply from Myanmar. It remains the dominant producer of Dysprosium Oxide and leads the world in refining capacity3.\nChina's control extends beyond production, as it also leads the world in refining capacity. With the exception of a small facility in Vietnam, China is the only country with operational Heavy Rare Earth Element (HREE) separation plants. Additional separation facilities outside of China include Iluka Resources' rare earth refinery which will have the capacity to process a variety of feedstocks, including those from third-party producers. Starting in 2027, Iluka will begin producing a range of rare earth oxides, including Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium and others6.\nIt is expected that China will maintain its dominant position in the HREE supply chain, with only limited global diversification. Given China's disproportionate role in these critical raw materials and the lack of viable alternative heavy rare earth production facilities, many OECD countries are increasingly looking for alternative supply options.\nThe scarcity of significant heavy rare earth resources outside of China, combined with the global push to diversify away from Chinese dominance, has created a favorable outlook for the future of heavy rare earths. This presents a unique opportunity for New Frontier Minerals to explore and develop new heavy rare earth sources, particularly at its Harts Range Project.\nTHE CRITICAL ROLE OF PERMANENT MAGNETS IN DEFENCE\nThe U.S. Department of Defence (DOD) is advancing efforts to build domestic supply chains for rare earth materials, crucial for manufacturing permanent magnets used in key military systems. These magnets are vital for technologies like the F-35 aircraft, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, and UAVs, as well as commercial applications such as radar and electrical generation systems8 (Figures 3 and 4).\nRare earth magnets are used in various Defence systems, including Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, and smart bombs. The F-35 requires over 900 pounds of rare earth materials, while a Virginia-class submarine requires up to 9,200 pounds. These materials are also essential in other systems, such as vehicle-mounted laser rangefinders and sonar equipment8.\nDefence applications represent a significant and growing portion of rare earth demand, particularly for heavy rare earth elements. Heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) such as Dysprosium, Terbium, and Yttrium are especially crucial for Defence applications, as they are key components in high-performance magnets, lasers, and aerospace technology. Due to their limited availability and strategic significance, these elements often fetch prices 5 to 10 times higher than light rare earths9.\nCurrently, the U.S. has limited domestic production, with only one active rare earth mine. The DOD aims to expand domestic capacity by investing in facilities for mining, separation, processing, and magnet production. This effort is critical to reducing U.S. reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, and ensuring national security by securing a stable supply of rare earth materials.\nFigure 3: F-35 aircraft requires over 900 pounds of rare earth materials8\nFigure 4: Virginia-class submarine, contains up to 9,200 pounds of rare earths8\nREFERENCES\n1)\nhttps://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/dysprosium-market#:~:text=This%20demand%20is%20projected%20to,earth%20element%20across%20different%20industries\n.\n2)\nhttps://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Important-Role-of-Dysprosium-in-Modern-Permanent-Magnets-150906.pdf\n3)\nhttps://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/transition-minerals/fuelling-the-future-poisoning-the-present-myanmars-rare-earth-boom/\n4)\nhttps://lynasrareearths.com/about-us/what-are-rare-earths/\n5)\nhttps://www.adamasintel.com/new-report-rare-earth-magnet-market-outlook-to-2040/\n6)\nhttps://www.iluka.com/operations-resource-development/resource-development/eneabba/\n7)\nhttps://www.metal.com/Rare-Earth-Metals\n8)\nhttps://www.Defence.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/\n9)\nhttps://discoveryalert.com.au/news-article/defence-critical-materials-australia-strategy-2025/#:~:text=Defence%20applications%20represent%20a%20significant,batteries%2C%20and%20advanced%20electrical%20systems\n10)\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/\nFor further information please contact\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited\n+61 8 6558 0886\nGerrard Hall (UK), Chairman\nSI Capital Limited\n(Financial Adviser and Corporate Broker)\n+44 (0)1483 413500\nNick Emerson\nGracechurch Group\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Henry Gamble\nAbout New Frontier Minerals\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited is an Australian-based focussed explorer, with a strategy to develop multi-commodity assets that demonstrate future potential as an economic mining operation.

These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.\n\u2022\nInclude reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.\n\u2022\nAspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.\n\u2022\nIn cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.\n\u00b7\nSurface samples were collected from approximately a 3m radius around the recorded coordinate location. The rock chip fragments that were collected to make up the sample included fragments that approximately ranged from 2-5cm and 0.2 - 3kg in weight. A total of twenty-eight (28) rock chip samples were collected in calico bags and were progressed for laboratory analysis (sample numbers range from HR419 to 510). Samples were collected from rock outcrops, soils, and occasionally mullock heaps in the vicinity of west to east trending pegmatite dykes. Many of the surface samples contained the U-bearing mineral samarskite.\nDrilling techniques\n\u2022\n\u2022 Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).\n\u00b7\nNot Applicable - no exploration drilling results as none were drilled.\nDrill sample recovery\n\u2022\nMethod of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.\n\u2022\nMeasures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.\n\u2022\nWhether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.\n\u00b7\nNot Applicable - no exploration drilling results as none were drilled.\nLogging\n\u2022\nWhether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.\n\u2022\nWhether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.\n\u2022\nThe total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.\n\u00b7\nDescriptions of the rock chip and soil samples are given in a table contained in Figure A1-1 of this CCZ's ASX Announcement dated the 14TH of October 2024.\n\u00b7\nWhere appropriate strike and dip measurements were taken at several sites, additional to the twenty (28) rock chip sample sites. Measuring bedding is difficult because of the high metamorphically - disturbed rock types.\nSubsampling techniques and sample preparation\n\u2022\nIf core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.\n\u2022\nIf non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.\n\u2022\nFor all sample types, the nature, quality, and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.\n\u2022\nQuality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.\n\u2022\nMeasures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.\n\u2022\nWhether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.\n\u00b7\nOf the sample collected about 0.3-2kg of rock chip were presented for analyses.\n\u00b7\nAssays were done by independent laboratory Ultra Trace Pty Ltd at Canning Vale Perth WA (now Amdel Limited) throughout 2007 and 2008. The samples were sorted and dried. Primary preparation was then by crushing the whole sample. The whole sample was pulverised in a vibrating disc pulveriser.\n\u00b7\nAll samples were initially crushed to 4 mm then pulverised to 75 microns, with at least 85% passing through 75 microns. Standard sample preparation and analyses procedures were performed on all samples and are considered appropriate techniques.\nQuality of assay data and laboratory tests\n\u2022\nThe nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.\n\u2022\nFor geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.\n\u2022\nNature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.\nAnalytical Methods are described in detail as follows:\nAu, Pt, Pd\n\u00b7\nThe samples have been analysed by firing a 40g (approx.) portion of the sample. This is the classical fire assay process and will give total separation of Gold, Platinum, and Palladium in the sample. These have been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectrometry. The sample(s) have been digested with a mixture of acids including Hydrofluoric, Nitric, Hydrochloric and Perchloric Acids. This digest approaches a total digest for many elements however some refractory oxides are not completely attacked.\n\u00b7\nThe mineral Cassiterite is not efficiently attacked with this digest.\n\u00b7\nIf Barium occurs as the Sulphate mineral, then at high levels (more than 4000 ppm) it may re-precipitate after the digest giving seriously low results. Using this digest, some sulphur losses may occur if the samples contain high levels of sulphide.\nCu, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn, P, Sc, V, Al, Ca, Na, K, S\nhave been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Optical Emission Spectrometry.\nAs, Ag, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ga, Li, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, W, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Th, U, Se, In, Te, Cs, Re, Tl\n\u00b7\nhave been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectrometry. The samples have been fused with Sodium Peroxide and subsequently the melt has been dissolved in dilute Hydrochloric acid for analysis. Because of the high furnace temperatures, volatile elements are lost. This procedure is particularly efficient for determination of Major element composition (Including Silica) in the samples or for the determination of refractory mineral species.\nB, Cr, Si, Fe, Mg, Ti\n\u00b7\nhave been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Optical Emission Spectrometry.\nGe, Ta, Hf, Zr, Nb, Rb\n\u00b7\nhave been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectrometry.\n\u00b7\nThe assay results were in line with previous rock chip and drilling results obtained since 2006 at Harts Range.\nVerification of sampling and assaying\n\u2022\nThe verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.\n\u2022\nThe use of twinned holes.\n\u2022\nDocumentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.\n\u2022\nDiscuss any adjustment to assay data.\n\u00b7\nIndependent Laboratory assaying by Ultra Trace has confirmed, within acceptable limits, the occurrences of high-grade Nb, U, and REE from the initial in field XRF readings. Laboratory standards and duplicates were used in accordance with standard procedures for geochemical assaying as noted below.\n\u00b7\nIt has met the recommended insertion rates for the company QAQC controls (standards, blanks) with an overall insertion rate of 20%. However, no field duplicates were included in the three (3) batches and is recommended that 3% be included in future sampling programs. Summary of QAQC insertion rates.\n\u00b7\nBoth the company standards and blanks were verified for elements Nb, U and Dy and returned results within 2 standard deviations (SD). Field duplicates are not present in the batch therefore were not reviewed.\nLocation of data points\n\u2022\nAccuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.\n\u2022\nSpecification of the grid system used.\n\u2022\nQuality and adequacy of topographic control.\n\u00b7\nThe spatial location for the rock chips and soils collected during the 2006 and 2007 fieldwork were collected by handheld GPS (-/+ 5m accuracy) [MGA94 Zone53]: The table of reported rock chip locations and descriptions are given in throughout the ASX release and in Figure A1-1 (at the end of the section).\nData spacing and distribution\n\u2022\nData spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u2022\nWhether the data spacing, and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.\n\u2022\nWhether sample compositing has been applied.\n\u00b7\nThe Harts Range licenses lie north-west of the Entia Dome and are underlain by the Harts Range Group (Harts Range Meta-igneous Complex), which predominantly consists of feldspar-biotite-amphibole-garnet gneisses. The Harts Range region at has undergone repeated and substantial crustal reworking between Proterozoic and Palaeozoic times and is now thought to represent an ancient and strongly altered/metamorphosed version of a continental collision zone.\n\u00b7\nMost of the observed mineralisation is related to a swarm of west to east and southeast-trending pegmatite dykes, with an anomalous occurrence of the U-bearing mineral samarskite.\n\u00b7\nAt the Cusp Prospect, niobium-HREE-Tantalum identified in pegmatites running approximately east-west, up to 10 metres thick and over 70 metres long.\n\u00b7\nAt Bob's Prospect niobium-HREE-Tantalum mineralisation in pegmatites trend east-west and is several metres thick and over 30 metres long, with similar geological setting to the Cusp Prospect.\n\u00b7\n200m west of Bobs (Bobs West), outcropping pegmatite along the same orientation, hosted exclusively within felsic gneiss of the Irindina Gneiss. The pegmatite is semi-continuous for ~300m with a similar geological setting and has notably large green muscovite flakes present.\n\u00b7\nThe Niobium Anomaly Prospect is another variant with high Niobium results but low in rare earths and uranium. Elevated radiometrics located with the scintillometer recorded 1,300 cps within a small historic pit at the top of a knoll. Anomalies appear to correlate with intrusions of porphyritic \"granitoid\" and granitic gneiss, which are geologically consistent with the pegmatites mapped at Bob's and the Cusp Prospects.\n\u00b7\nThe Thorium Anomaly Prospect was previously located via airborne radiometric images. The radiometric anomalies are low order (10 to 20x background) compared to the spot anomalies at Bob's and Cusp (50-200x background). Anomalies appear to correlate with intrusions of porphyritic \"granitoid\" and granitic gneiss, which presumably are geologically features like the pegmatites at Bob's and the Cusp Prospects.\nOrientation of data in relation to geological structure\n\u2022\nWhether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.\n\u2022\nIf the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.\n\u00b7\nIn general, the strata of the area surrounding the pegmatite dykes in the Harts Range Meta-Igneous Complex dip steeply (>45 degrees) to the north and strike between east to southeast.\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples were taken at areas of interest from observed mineralisation along and across strike of the line of lode of the mineralised pegmatite dyke (very generally east west tends, secondary structures, surrounding spoil heaps, and across the four (4) anomalous areas originally identified in the planning stage.\n\u00b7\nHowever, no modern systematic exploration has been conducted, nor any of the mineralised prospects have ever been drilled.\nSample security\n\u2022\nThe measures taken to ensure sample security.\n\u00b7\nThe rock chip samples taken during the historical fieldwork were securely locked within the vehicle on site until delivered to Alice Springs by the field personnel for despatch to the laboratory (Ultra Trace in WA) by courier.\nAudits or reviews\n\u2022\nThe results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.\n\u00b7\nThe sampling techniques and the data generated from the laboratory assay results have been peer reviewed by consultant geologists independent of Castillo Copper Limited (Audax Resources and ROM Resources) familiar with the overall Harts Range Project and deemed to be acceptable.\n\u00b7\nNo other external audits sampling techniques and data have yet been planned or undertaken.\nFIGURE A1-1: HARTS RANGE PROJECT - VARIOUS SURFACE SAMPLES LOCATIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS\nSample ID\nProspect Name\nEasting\nNorthing\nAHD\nType\nRock Type\nLab Job#\nNiobium (Nb)\nUranium (U)\nYttrium (Y)\nTantalum (Ta)\nDysprosium (Dy)\nTerbium (Tb)\nFull Description\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nHR419\nCusp Prospect\n507843.0\n7447754.0\n622.0\nGrab sub-crop composite\nPEG\nU109728\n17.5\n10.1\n5.6\n9.3\n1.1\n0.18\nSAMARSKITE (or similar): dense brittle blackish lustrous radioactive mineral;

Two granted tenements (EL 32046 and 32513) comprising a total 110 km2 tenement package is located near essential infrastructure and accessible via the Plenty Highway.\n\u00b7\nA check on the tenures status was completed in the NTGS system 'Strike' on the 10 of October 2024, to validate the currentness of the exploration areas. All are current.\n\u00b7\nThe region is serviced by excellent roads (Stuart Highway), train (the famous Ghan rail) and bus links connect the area.\n\u00b7\nDomestic and some international flights are available from Alice Springs (1 hour drive south of Harts Range) while all international flights are available direct from Darwin.\n\u00b7\nAs a major regional centre, the town of Alice Springs provides public and private schools. There are churches, supermarkets, speciality shops, hotels, motels, caf\u00e9s & restaurants, medical centres.\n\u00b7\nThere is a professional police and emergency services presence throughout the area. Local professional and trade services support the community\nand the mining industry. Mobile phone and internet access are good.\nExploration done by other parties\n\u2022\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\n\u00b7\nHistorical \"Strike\"-based mineral exploration reports have been reviewed for\nhistorical tenures that cover or partially cover the Project Area in this announcement. Federal and State Government reports supplement the historical mineral exploration reporting (QDEX open file exploration records).\n\u00b7\nMost explorers were searching for either Cu-Au-U, gemstones, or industrial minerals in the 1990's, and proving satellite deposit style extensions to the several small subeconomic uranium or copper deposits.\n\u00b7\nThe project is flanked\nby Independence Group (IGO) to the north, south and west. IGO is exploring for a raft of critical battery minerals.\nGeology\n\u2022\nDeposit type, geological setting, and style of mineralisation.\nRegional Geology\n\u00b7\nThe Harts Range Niobium, Uranium-Heavy Rare Earth Project lies north-west of\nthe Entia Dome (Figure A2-1) and is underlain by the Harts Range Group (Harts Range Meta-igneous Complex), which predominantly consists of feldspar-biotite-amphibole-garnet gneisses.\n\u00b7\nThe Harts Range region has undergone repeated and substantial crustal re-working between Proterozoic and Palaeozoic times. As a result, it is now believed to represent an ancient and strongly altered/metamorphosed version of a continental collision zone.\n\u00b7\nMagnetotellurics data interpreted by a team consisting of Adelaide University and NTGS geologists (Selway et al, 2006) suggests the Entia Dome system is a deep-crustal feature that can be shown extending to the mantle.\n\u00b7\nThe below maps (Figures A2-2 and A2-3) show a traverse through the Arunta from north to south and skirted around the dome to the east and highlighting a major subduction zone to the north of the dome. The latter diagram\nshows the distribution of regional stratigraphic units.\nFIGURES A2-1: REGIONAL STRUCTURE PLAN\nFIGURE A2-2: WEST TO EAST REGIONAL CRUSTAL CROSS-SECTION\nFIGURE A2-3: REGIONAL GEOLOGY\nLocal Geology\n\u00b7\nThe main rock types mapped and sampled at various REE\nProspects\ninclude:\no\nBiotite Schist/Granofels: brown-blackish biotite-rich rock; thin (5-10cm) poorly exposed zone on N side of ~6m thick unit/zone of similar rock (e.g. HR398, HR399 sites) (on N side of HR399).\no\nPegmatite, apatite-bearing: scree frags near W end of E-W pegmatite, near intersection with north-south calcite vein; very coarse-grained feldspar-quartz with common coarse apatite - pale semi-translucent slightly greenish (rare honey-brown) blocky/tabular/hexagonal, some intergrown with feldspar/quartz.\no\nGarnet-Cummingtonite rock: coarse-grained rock; with abundant interstitial pale greenish malachite-magnesite material; small patch of sub-crop amongst scree.\no\nGneiss: weathered, moderately banded, fine-to-medium grained quartz-feldspar-hornblende-garnet; some coarser quartz-garnet rock; some brown haematite on fractures; sample below HR444.\no\nUltramafics: slightly weathered medium grained, greenish/brownish amphibole/olivine-dominated meta-ultramafic.\no\nAmphibolite: grey fine-grained hornblende -quartz rock; (approx. adjacent rough channel samples: HR461 (1m) above HR462 (3m) above HR463 (3m) above HR464 (1m)).\no\nSamarskite (or similar), being a dense brittle blackish lustrous radioactive mineral; cluster of 10+ fragments, most over 1cm (or broken weathered larger piece - ca. 5-10 cm) in chalky white feldspar, beside weathered coarse mica beneath soil cover along southern side of quartz vein in a pegmatite core.\nDrillhole\nInformation\n\u2022\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: o easting and northing of the drill hole collar\no\nelevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\no\ndip and azimuth of the hole o down hole length and interception depth o hole length.\n\u2022\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\n\u00b7\nNot Applicable - no exploration drilling results presented.\nData aggregation methods\n\u2022\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\n\u2022\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\n\u2022\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\n\u00b7\nIndependent Laboratory Assay results for the 28 rock chip samples from various Harts Range Prospects were averaged if more than one reading or determination was given. There was no cutting of high-grade REE results as they are directly relatable to high grade mineralisation styles readily visible in the relevant samples.\n\u00b7\nThere were no cut-off grades factored into any reporting of the laboratory assay results.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\n\u2022\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u2022\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\n\u2022\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g. 'down hole length, true width not known').\n\u00b7\nThe 2006-7 rock chip and soil samples were taken at areas of interest from\nobserved mineralisation along the line of lode of the mineralised pegmatite dyke, secondary structures, and surrounding spoil heaps. Twenty-one (21) rock chip samples collected from rock faces and/or outcrops.\n\u00b7\nEight (8) rock chip samples collected from stockpiles, shaft waste piles, and\n/or boulders of rock onsite.\nDiagrams\n\u2022\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\n\u00b7\nAppropriate diagrams are presented in the body and the Appendices of the current ASX Release. Where scales are absent from the diagram, grids have been included and clearly labelled to act as a scale for distance.\n\u00b7\nMaps and Plans presented in the current ASX Release are in MGA94 Zone 53, Eastings (mN), and Northing (mN), unless clearly labelled\notherwise.\nBalanced reporting\n\u2022\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced avoiding misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u00b7\nRock chip samples were taken at areas of interest from observed mineralisation along the line of lode of the mineralised pegmatite dyke, secondary structures, surrounding spoil heaps, and to the north and south of the line of lode to check the validity of the defined four (4) anomalous map areas.\nOther substantive exploration data\n\u2022\n\u2022 Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\n\u00b7\nThe\narea is covered by regional airborne government and private radiometric, gravity, magnetic, and hyperspectral surveys. Unfortunately, other than the 2006 radiometric ground survey, no other ground surveys have been undertaken.\n\u00b7\nSubstantial historical and current ground geochemical (stream sediment, soil, and rock chip samples have been undertaken and two episodes\nof shallow drilling, mostly for industrial minerals (gemstones and vermiculite) by the owners of the leases, since 2006.\nFurther work\n\u2022\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\n\u2022\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\no\nA\nfuture exploration strategy should encompass the following steps in subsequent field programs:\no\nReconnaissance mapping programs.\no\nClose-spaced radiometric geophysical surveys.\no\nDetailed mapping and rock chip sampling across prospects.\no\nRegional soil sampling campaigns.\no\nMineral characterisation studies and petrological analysis.\no\nTarget generation and prioritisation; and\no\nExploratory drill\n-testing.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department has confirmed completion of the initial regulatory review and is now undertaking a detailed technical assessment of the MLA.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nMining Lease Application (MLA) over the Big One Copper Deposit has advanced into technical assessment, following completion of the initial regulatory review by the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department\n\u00b7\nThe Big One Copper Deposit hosts a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 2.1Mt @ 1.1% Cu [1], and an additional 7,000t @ 1.3% Cu of surface Indicated stockpiles, positioning Big One as a potential near-term cash flow opportunity [2]\n\u00b7\nEstablished processing pathway identified via haulage to Austral Resources' Mt Kelly Processing Facility, subject to approvals and economics [3]\n\u00b7\nSulphuric acid leach test-work has delivered indicative copper recoveries of up to 99%, confirming suitability for conventional acid leach processing [4]\n\u00b7\nProposed initial activities would target near-surface copper mineralisation and the transport of existing historical stockpiles, supporting a low-strip, surface-based development approach\n\u00b7\nFurther resource drilling could potentially extend known mineralisation at the Big One Copper Deposit, where key historical intercepts included:\no\nBH 303RC: 40m @ 1.64% Cu from surface incl: 11m @ 4.40% Cu from 24m, 5m @ 7.34% Cu from 28m & 1m @ 16.65% Cu from 29m [5]\no\nBH 301RC: 44m @ 1.19% Cu from surface incl: 14m @ 3.55% Cu from 27m, 3m @ 10.88% Cu from 37m & 1m @ 12.6% Cu from 37m [5]\no\nBH BO017: 34m @ 1.51% Cu from surface incl: 21m @ 2.25% Cu from surface, 12m @ 3.44% Cu from 3m, 6m @ 4.79% Cu from 3m and 1m @ 9.4% Cu from 9m [6]\n\u00b7\nThe current copper upcycle has seen the copper price exceed US$12,500/t, driven by supply disruptions and strong demand associated with global electrification and the ongoing energy transition.\nChairman Gerrard Hall\ncommented\n:\n\"Advancement of the Mining Lease Application into technical assessment represents an important milestone for New Frontier. The Big One Deposit offers a compelling opportunity to potentially process NWQ ore at the existing Mt Kelly Facility, leveraging existing infrastructure and established processing pathways, while continuing to engage constructively with regulators.\"\nBIG ONE DEPOSIT\nThe MLA for the Big One Deposit (Figure 1) represents a significant milestone, strengthening New Frontier's position across the broader NWQ Copper Project, which is located within a well-established district hosting multiple operating mines and development projects with access to regional infrastructure and processing facilities.\nThe MLA is supported by an Initial Development Plan outlining a potential open-cut mining scenario designed to test and extract near-surface copper mineralisation. Subject to approvals, preparatory earthworks are expected to commence in Q3 2026.\nThe development plan proposes mining and haulage to the Mt Kelly Processing Facility, operated by Austral Resources Ltd.\nFigure 1: Plan view showing the proposed Big One Deposit MLA area and site preparation activities, including the bulk sample zone, laydown area, stockpile, and access tracks\nAUSTRAL RESOURCES - MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\nThe MLA builds on the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") signed earlier this year between New Frontier and Austral Resources Ltd [2], which established a framework for evaluating toll treatment and ore supply opportunities at the Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility (Figure 2). The lodgement and advancement of the MLA represents another step toward potential near-term development of the Big One Deposit within the broader NWQ Copper Project.\nSulphuric acid leach test-work conducted on material sourced from the Big One historical stockpiles has delivered indicative copper recoveries of up to 99%, confirming suitability for conventional acid leach processing [3]. The results indicate favourable mineralogy and rapid copper dissolution under standard conditions, supporting a simple, low-risk processing flowsheet and reinforcing the viability of toll-treatment via Austral's Mt Kelly Processing Facility.\nThe proposed operation is designed to leverage the site's existing footprint, including previously disturbed pits and infrastructure, minimising surface impact and supporting New Frontier's commitment to responsible development.\nFigure 2: Aerial view of Austral's Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility\nNEXT STEPS\n\u00b7\nContinue engagement with the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department as the MLA advances through the technical assessment.\n\u00b7\nProgress assessment of priority mining areas and historical stockpiles outside the current Mineral Resource Estimate.\n\u00b7\nReceive and assess assay results from the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earths drilling program.\n\u00b7\nProgress the proposed OTCQB listing in the United States, with the application submitted and approval pending.\nENDS\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of New Frontier Minerals Ltd.\nFor further information please contact:\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited\n+61 8 6558 0886\nGerrard Hall (UK), Chairman\nS.
