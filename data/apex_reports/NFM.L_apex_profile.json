The Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department has confirmed completion of the initial regulatory review and is now undertaking a detailed technical assessment of the MLA.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nMining Lease Application (MLA) over the Big One Copper Deposit has advanced into technical assessment, following completion of the initial regulatory review by the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department\n\u00b7\nThe Big One Copper Deposit hosts a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 2.1Mt @ 1.1% Cu [1], and an additional 7,000t @ 1.3% Cu of surface Indicated stockpiles, positioning Big One as a potential near-term cash flow opportunity [2]\n\u00b7\nEstablished processing pathway identified via haulage to Austral Resources' Mt Kelly Processing Facility, subject to approvals and economics [3]\n\u00b7\nSulphuric acid leach test-work has delivered indicative copper recoveries of up to 99%, confirming suitability for conventional acid leach processing [4]\n\u00b7\nProposed initial activities would target near-surface copper mineralisation and the transport of existing historical stockpiles, supporting a low-strip, surface-based development approach\n\u00b7\nFurther resource drilling could potentially extend known mineralisation at the Big One Copper Deposit, where key historical intercepts included:\no\nBH 303RC: 40m @ 1.64% Cu from surface incl: 11m @ 4.40% Cu from 24m, 5m @ 7.34% Cu from 28m & 1m @ 16.65% Cu from 29m [5]\no\nBH 301RC: 44m @ 1.19% Cu from surface incl: 14m @ 3.55% Cu from 27m, 3m @ 10.88% Cu from 37m & 1m @ 12.6% Cu from 37m [5]\no\nBH BO017: 34m @ 1.51% Cu from surface incl: 21m @ 2.25% Cu from surface, 12m @ 3.44% Cu from 3m, 6m @ 4.79% Cu from 3m and 1m @ 9.4% Cu from 9m [6]\n\u00b7\nThe current copper upcycle has seen the copper price exceed US$12,500/t, driven by supply disruptions and strong demand associated with global electrification and the ongoing energy transition.\nChairman Gerrard Hall\ncommented\n:\n\"Advancement of the Mining Lease Application into technical assessment represents an important milestone for New Frontier. The Big One Deposit offers a compelling opportunity to potentially process NWQ ore at the existing Mt Kelly Facility, leveraging existing infrastructure and established processing pathways, while continuing to engage constructively with regulators.\"\nBIG ONE DEPOSIT\nThe MLA for the Big One Deposit (Figure 1) represents a significant milestone, strengthening New Frontier's position across the broader NWQ Copper Project, which is located within a well-established district hosting multiple operating mines and development projects with access to regional infrastructure and processing facilities.\nThe MLA is supported by an Initial Development Plan outlining a potential open-cut mining scenario designed to test and extract near-surface copper mineralisation. Subject to approvals, preparatory earthworks are expected to commence in Q3 2026.\nThe development plan proposes mining and haulage to the Mt Kelly Processing Facility, operated by Austral Resources Ltd.\nFigure 1: Plan view showing the proposed Big One Deposit MLA area and site preparation activities, including the bulk sample zone, laydown area, stockpile, and access tracks\nAUSTRAL RESOURCES - MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\nThe MLA builds on the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") signed earlier this year between New Frontier and Austral Resources Ltd [2], which established a framework for evaluating toll treatment and ore supply opportunities at the Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility (Figure 2). The lodgement and advancement of the MLA represents another step toward potential near-term development of the Big One Deposit within the broader NWQ Copper Project.\nSulphuric acid leach test-work conducted on material sourced from the Big One historical stockpiles has delivered indicative copper recoveries of up to 99%, confirming suitability for conventional acid leach processing [3]. The results indicate favourable mineralogy and rapid copper dissolution under standard conditions, supporting a simple, low-risk processing flowsheet and reinforcing the viability of toll-treatment via Austral's Mt Kelly Processing Facility.\nThe proposed operation is designed to leverage the site's existing footprint, including previously disturbed pits and infrastructure, minimising surface impact and supporting New Frontier's commitment to responsible development.\nFigure 2: Aerial view of Austral's Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility\nNEXT STEPS\n\u00b7\nContinue engagement with the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department as the MLA advances through the technical assessment.\n\u00b7\nProgress assessment of priority mining areas and historical stockpiles outside the current Mineral Resource Estimate.\n\u00b7\nReceive and assess assay results from the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earths drilling program.\n\u00b7\nProgress the proposed OTCQB listing in the United States, with the application submitted and approval pending.\nENDS\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of New Frontier Minerals Ltd.\nFor further information please contact:\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited\n+61 8 6558 0886\nGerrard Hall (UK), Chairman\nS.

We have advanced the potential of the Harts Range Project, lodged the mining lease for the Big One Deposit, and secured strategic partnerships with Metallium and Austral Resources-providing clear development pathways at a time of strengthening demand for heavy rare earths and copper.\nThe Board looks forward to the incoming drill results from Harts Range and continued progress at Big One, both of which offer substantial potential to create shareholder value. As we close out 2025, we would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and look forward to a strong and prosperous 2026.\"\nDRILLING CAMPAIGN NEARING COMPLETION\nThe reverse circulation drilling campaign at the Harts Range Project is progressing on schedule and within budget, with the drilling campaign nearing completion. Importantly, all high-priority targets have been systematically drill-tested, to provide a strong geological understanding across the project area. The geology team is optimistic the insights from the drilling campaign will provide a signi\ufb01cant understanding of the underlying heavy rare earths system, especially the extent of dysprosium and terbium mineralisation.\nSample batches will be dispatched to ALS Adelaide for assay analysis, with results expected to deliver valuable insights into the scale and continuity of the heavy rare earth system.\nBIG ONE DEPOSIT - MINING LEASE APPLICATION\nThe MLA for the Big One Deposit represents a signi\ufb01cant milestone, strengthening New Frontier's position across the broader NWQ Copper Project, which lies within one of Australia's most proven districts for structurally controlled copper mineralisation. This proven district hosts multiple operating mines and development projects, providing New Frontier with access to established regional infrastructure and processing pathways.\nThe MLA lodged covering the Big One Deposit, within NWQ Copper Project, in the Mt Isa copper belt, north-west Queensland covers 240Ha, securing tenure over the historical workings and surrounding mineralised structures. An Initial Development Plan outlines the potential open-cut copper mining, with the layout of the proposed operation in Year 2 illustrated in Figure 2 below.\nThe MLA builds on the MOU signed earlier this year between New Frontier Minerals and Austral Resources, which established a framework for evaluating toll treatment and ore supply opportunities at the Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility.\nFigure 2: Plan view showing the proposed Big One Deposit MLA area and Year Two activities\nENDS\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of New Frontier Minerals Ltd.\nFor further information please contact:\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited\n+61 8 6558 0886\nGerrard Hall (UK), Chairman\nS.
