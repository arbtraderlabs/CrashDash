This follows exceptional test-work results on Harts Range raw ore, especially Dy/Tb, using MTM's proprietary FJH technology.\nExceptional Test-Work Results\nThe 25kg bulk sample from the Harts Range Project (un-beneficiated ore, crushed/ground feed) underwent MTM's proprietary FJH process (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: FJH Test Units at the Anahuac Technology Campus, Chambers County, Texas. (Source: Metallium)\nThe sample from Harts Range (un-beneficiated ore, crushed/ground feed) underwent Metallium's proprietary FJH process (Figure 2).\nTotal rare-earth oxide (TREO) content increased from ~1.7 % to ~35 % in a single FJH reaction step, representing ~20x upgrade (Table 1).\n\u00b7\nKey heavy REEs Dy and Tb, and magnet REE Nd concentrations increased significantly\n\u00b7\nDy\u2082O\u2083 upgraded 53\u00d7 (0.19% \u2192 10.03%) / 11% \u2192 29% of the REO basket (+160%)\n\u00b7\nTb\u2084O\u2087 upgraded 21\u00d7 (0.03% \u2192 0.64%) / 1.7% \u2192 1.8% of the REO basket (+5%)\n\u00b7\nNd\u2082O\u2083 upgraded 114\u00d7 (0.05% \u2192 5.69%) / 2.9% \u2192 16.3% of the REO basket (+460%)\n\u00b7\nComplete removal of detectable Fe\u2082O\u2083, SiO\u2082 and Th\n\u00b7\nPartial yttrium rejection, reducing Y\u2082O\u2083 from 61% to 35% of the REO basket\n\u00b7\nNo traditional acid-leach or reagent-heavy beneficiation route was applied pre-FJH, underscoring metallurgical simplicity and fast processing capability\nMTM is currently modelling the next phase of optimisation, including additional FJH treatment and post-sample processing for increased recoveries.\nMTM's Texas Technology Campus will be used to scale up the reactor size, optimise reactor parameters and deliver customer-qualification grade products.\nSamples were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by an independent, accredited commercial laboratory.\nFigure 2:\nSingle-step Flash Mass Balance Diagram (Source: Metallium)\nTable 1: REE Recovery and Impurity Removal - Assay Before and After FJH Treatment & Enrichment Ratio (Source: Metallium)\nFigure 3: Metallium's indicative operating model - exclusive processing rights over Harts Range enable a \"Processing-as-a-Service\" structure, generating both per-tonne licensing fees & production royalties without mining or operating risk (Source: Metallium)\nBinding Commercial Framework\nUnder the terms of the binding commercial framework, New Frontier has agreed to the following:\n\u00b7\nMTM has binding, exclusive, project-linked rights to apply FJH (and derivative processing) to all ore, concentrate or other feed from the Harts Range Project for a minimum of 10 years, with automatic rollover into production stage.\n\u00b7\nUpon commercial production of a Dy/Tb-rich product, MTM will earn:\no\na royalty (1.5% Net Smelter Return equivalent) on sales of finished product; and\no\na margin for processing Harts Range feed through MTM's facility.\n\u00b7\nThe structure includes a buy-back right allowing the project owner (or successor) to acquire a portion of the royalty for a fixed amount, enabling MTM to crystallise value.\n\u00b7\nMTM holds rights that travel with the project in the event of ownership change, ensuring the processing exclusivity remains intact.\nMTM's Texas Technology Campus serves dual purpose: core waste-to-value facility (e-waste, PCBs, speciality metals) and demonstration/refinement hub for HREE feedstocks and product qualification with U.S. / allied off-takers.\nStrategic Upside for New Frontier Through MTM Alignment\nBy exclusively aligning with MTM, which is positioning itself as a gatekeeper for heavy-rare-earth refining in the Western supply chain, New Frontier has a clear path to market for its unique Dy/Tb-rich feedstock.\nThe FJH process has now been demonstrated on Harts Range raw ore rather than just scraps or tailings - showing technology scalability and feed-type flexibility, increasing the addressable value chain.\nWith downstream product qualification pathways (including U.S. magnet and defence supply chains), New Frontier can leverage MTM's early upgrade results into commercial optionality, not just exploration upside.\nGiven global policy momentum toward allied-market rare-earth supply (including U.S. DoD and export-control tailwinds), the timing aligns with premium valuation themes for heavy-rare-earth exposures.\nDRILLING CAMPAIGN COMPLETED\nOn 3 November 2025, New Frontier announced a maiden RC drilling campaign, comprising up to 46 holes to test surface mineralisation at the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earth and Niobium Project, NT, had been finalised.\nOn 10 November 2025, New Frontier confirmed approval was granted by the NT Department of Mining and Energy enabling the inaugural drilling campaign at the Harts Range Project to progress. The main focus of the campaign was targeting multiple high-priority anomalies defined through regional geophysics, detailed geological mapping and surface geochemistry completed by the geology team over the past 12 months.\nThe campaign was designed to test the depth extension of the heavy rare earth mineralisation, with particular attention to dysprosium and terbium - critical elements in high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and advanced defence technologies.\nMeanwhile, following a comprehensive review, New Frontier applied to list on the US OTCQB market to enhance visibility and gain access to US investors wanting exposure to Australian explorers focused on critical minerals, especially heavy rare earth elements.\nOn 2 December 2025, New Frontier announced the commencement of its maiden ~2,500m reverse-circulation drill program at the Harts Range Project.\nShortly after 15 December 2025 (ASX Release date), the RC drilling campaign at the Harts Range Project was completed on time and within budget. Importantly, all high-priority targets were systematically drill-tested, to provide a strong geological understanding across the project area. The geology team is optimistic the insights from the drilling campaign will provide a significant understanding of the underlying heavy rare earths system, especially the extent of dysprosium and terbium mineralisation.\nSample batches were dispatched to ALS Adelaide for assay analysis, with results expected to deliver valuable insights into the scale and continuity of the heavy rare earth system.\nNWQ COPPER PROJECT\nOn 13 November 2025, New Frontier announced that it had lodged an MLA over the Big One Deposit, part of the NWQ Copper Project located circa 150 km north of Mount Isa, north-west Queensland.\nDevelopment plan\nThe MLA for the Big One Deposit (Figure 4) represents a significant milestone, strengthening New Frontier's position across the broader NWQ Copper Project, which lies within one of Australia's most proven districts for structurally controlled copper mineralisation. This proven district hosts multiple operating mines and development projects, providing New Frontier with access to established regional infrastructure and processing pathways.\nThe MLA is accompanied by an Initial Development Plan that outlines a potential mining scenario to guide future evaluation and regulatory assessment. The plan outlines a proposed open-cut operation designed to test and extract near-surface copper mineralisation. Under the initial Development Plan, preparatory earthworks are to commence in Q3 2026, with first production targeted for Q1 2027. These timelines are conceptual and subject to regulatory approvals, funding and technical studies.\nThe development plan proposes mining and haulage to the Mt Kelly Processing Facility (operated by Austral Resources).\nFigure 4: Plan view showing the proposed Big One Deposit MLA area and Year One activities, including the bulk sample zone, laydown area, stockpile, and access tracks\nAustral Resources MOU\nThe MLA builds on the MOU signed earlier this year between New Frontier and Austral Resources, which established a framework for evaluating toll treatment and ore supply opportunities at the Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility. The lodgement of the MLA represents another step towards this collaboration, aligning with New Frontier's goal of progressing the Big One Deposit towards potential near-term development within the broader NWQ Copper Project.\nThe proposed operation is designed to leverage the site's existing footprint, including previously disturbed pits and infrastructure, minimising surface impact and supporting New Frontier's commitment to responsible development.\nCORPORATE ACTIVITY\nSuccessful Capital Raise\nOn 25 November 2025, New Frontier announced it had received firm commitments from new and existing investors to subscribe for A$2,250,000 (before costs) through a placement of 107,142,857 shares to professional and sophisticated investors at an issue price of $0.021 per share. Participants in the placement will receive, subject to shareholder approval, one free attaching option for every two new shares allocated in the placement, with an exercise price of $0.04 per option and a 2-year expiry from the date of issue.\nNew Appointments\nOn 3 December 2025, New Frontier confirmed retaining the technical and corporate services of senior consultant Kevin Das, a highly experienced geologist and mining executive with 24+ years across global jurisdictions. In addition, Joel Logan was promoted to Executive Director, strengthening operational oversight on the group's projects.\nThese appointments support NFM's objective to accelerate exploration, expand resource definition, and enhance long-term value creation.\nFINANCIAL UPDATE\nQuarterly Cash and Liquid Investments Position\nCash on hand and liquid investments at end of the quarter totalled $3.0 million (including cash on hand of $2.6m and ASX listed shares, as noted below).\nNFM holds 40 million Infinity Mining Limited (ASX: IMI) tradeable shares which have a total market value of ~$360,000 (40 million shares x $0.009 per share as at 31/12/2025) along with 20 million unlisted options (expiry 30/11/2029, strike $0.07).\nRehabilitation security bonds held at the end of the quarter totalled $125,000.\nSecurities on Issue at Quarter End\nOrdinary shares\n1,718,355,482\nOptions\n33,500,000\nPerformance rights\n25,500,000\nTo view Appendix 5B, which incorporates the quarterly cash flow report, click here:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/9737Q_1-2026-1-29.pdf\nInformation Required Under ASX Listing Rules\n1.

The Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department has confirmed completion of the initial regulatory review and is now undertaking a detailed technical assessment of the MLA.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nMining Lease Application (MLA) over the Big One Copper Deposit has advanced into technical assessment, following completion of the initial regulatory review by the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department\n\u00b7\nThe Big One Copper Deposit hosts a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 2.1Mt @ 1.1% Cu [1], and an additional 7,000t @ 1.3% Cu of surface Indicated stockpiles, positioning Big One as a potential near-term cash flow opportunity [2]\n\u00b7\nEstablished processing pathway identified via haulage to Austral Resources' Mt Kelly Processing Facility, subject to approvals and economics [3]\n\u00b7\nSulphuric acid leach test-work has delivered indicative copper recoveries of up to 99%, confirming suitability for conventional acid leach processing [4]\n\u00b7\nProposed initial activities would target near-surface copper mineralisation and the transport of existing historical stockpiles, supporting a low-strip, surface-based development approach\n\u00b7\nFurther resource drilling could potentially extend known mineralisation at the Big One Copper Deposit, where key historical intercepts included:\no\nBH 303RC: 40m @ 1.64% Cu from surface incl: 11m @ 4.40% Cu from 24m, 5m @ 7.34% Cu from 28m & 1m @ 16.65% Cu from 29m [5]\no\nBH 301RC: 44m @ 1.19% Cu from surface incl: 14m @ 3.55% Cu from 27m, 3m @ 10.88% Cu from 37m & 1m @ 12.6% Cu from 37m [5]\no\nBH BO017: 34m @ 1.51% Cu from surface incl: 21m @ 2.25% Cu from surface, 12m @ 3.44% Cu from 3m, 6m @ 4.79% Cu from 3m and 1m @ 9.4% Cu from 9m [6]\n\u00b7\nThe current copper upcycle has seen the copper price exceed US$12,500/t, driven by supply disruptions and strong demand associated with global electrification and the ongoing energy transition.\nChairman Gerrard Hall\ncommented\n:\n\"Advancement of the Mining Lease Application into technical assessment represents an important milestone for New Frontier. The Big One Deposit offers a compelling opportunity to potentially process NWQ ore at the existing Mt Kelly Facility, leveraging existing infrastructure and established processing pathways, while continuing to engage constructively with regulators.\"\nBIG ONE DEPOSIT\nThe MLA for the Big One Deposit (Figure 1) represents a significant milestone, strengthening New Frontier's position across the broader NWQ Copper Project, which is located within a well-established district hosting multiple operating mines and development projects with access to regional infrastructure and processing facilities.\nThe MLA is supported by an Initial Development Plan outlining a potential open-cut mining scenario designed to test and extract near-surface copper mineralisation. Subject to approvals, preparatory earthworks are expected to commence in Q3 2026.\nThe development plan proposes mining and haulage to the Mt Kelly Processing Facility, operated by Austral Resources Ltd.\nFigure 1: Plan view showing the proposed Big One Deposit MLA area and site preparation activities, including the bulk sample zone, laydown area, stockpile, and access tracks\nAUSTRAL RESOURCES - MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\nThe MLA builds on the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") signed earlier this year between New Frontier and Austral Resources Ltd [2], which established a framework for evaluating toll treatment and ore supply opportunities at the Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility (Figure 2). The lodgement and advancement of the MLA represents another step toward potential near-term development of the Big One Deposit within the broader NWQ Copper Project.\nSulphuric acid leach test-work conducted on material sourced from the Big One historical stockpiles has delivered indicative copper recoveries of up to 99%, confirming suitability for conventional acid leach processing [3]. The results indicate favourable mineralogy and rapid copper dissolution under standard conditions, supporting a simple, low-risk processing flowsheet and reinforcing the viability of toll-treatment via Austral's Mt Kelly Processing Facility.\nThe proposed operation is designed to leverage the site's existing footprint, including previously disturbed pits and infrastructure, minimising surface impact and supporting New Frontier's commitment to responsible development.\nFigure 2: Aerial view of Austral's Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility\nNEXT STEPS\n\u00b7\nContinue engagement with the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines Department as the MLA advances through the technical assessment.\n\u00b7\nProgress assessment of priority mining areas and historical stockpiles outside the current Mineral Resource Estimate.\n\u00b7\nReceive and assess assay results from the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earths drilling program.\n\u00b7\nProgress the proposed OTCQB listing in the United States, with the application submitted and approval pending.\nENDS\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board of New Frontier Minerals Ltd.\nFor further information please contact:\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited\n+61 8 6558 0886\nGerrard Hall (UK), Chairman\nS.
