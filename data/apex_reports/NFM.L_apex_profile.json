The Harts Range Heavy Rare Earths Project is located 140km north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nNew Frontier Minerals has formally completed Stage 1 earn-in requirements to secure an 85% interest in key tenement, EL32513, within the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earths Project, Northern Territory\n\u00b7\nFormal documentation has been submitted to the Northern Territory regulator to effect the transfer of the mineral titles\n\u00b7\nAdditional Harts Range tenements 100% owned by NFM have been granted, expanding NFM's landholding and regional exploration upside\n\u00b7\nEarn-in milestone achieved ahead of anticipated assay results from NFM's inaugural Harts Range drilling campaign expected in the coming weeks\n\u00b7\nWith all applications submitted, NFM expects to be listed and trading on the OTCQB during the first week of February 2026\nChairman Gerrard Hall\ncommented\n:\n\"With assay results from the recent Harts Range drilling campaign expected shortly, it is timely that the Company has now satisfied the Stage 1 earn-in requirements and secured an 85% interest in a key tenement within the Harts Range Project. This milestone materially strengthens New Frontier Minerals' ownership position across the Project at a pivotal point in the exploration program.\nThe relevant transfer documentation has been submitted and is currently being progressed with the Northern Territory regulator, providing NFM with increased certainty and flexibility as it prepares to assess and advance the forthcoming drill results.\"\nEarn-In Milestone and Market Update\nNew Frontier Minerals Limited (ASX: NFM) is pleased to advise that it has formally completed the Stage 1 earn-in requirements and secured an 85% interest in a key tenement, EL32513, within the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earths Project, located approximately 140 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory (Figure1).\nCompletion of the Stage 1 earn-in represents a material milestone for the Company, providing majority ownership and effective operational control over a strategically important component of the Harts Range Project. Relevant documentation has now been submitted to the Northern Territory regulator to affect the formal transfer of the mineral title.\nAdditional tenements (EL34110 and EL34109), which were recently granted and are 100% owned by NFM, further expand the Company's landholding in the Harts Range region, enhancing regional exploration potential and discovery upside.\nThe tenement forms part of an emerging heavy rare earths province prospective for dysprosium, terbium and associated critical minerals, which are increasingly recognised as essential inputs for advanced manufacturing, defence technologies and clean energy supply chains (Figure 2).

This follows exceptional test-work results on Harts Range raw ore, especially Dy/Tb, using MTM's proprietary FJH technology.\nExceptional Test-Work Results\nThe 25kg bulk sample from the Harts Range Project (un-beneficiated ore, crushed/ground feed) underwent MTM's proprietary FJH process (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: FJH Test Units at the Anahuac Technology Campus, Chambers County, Texas. (Source: Metallium)\nThe sample from Harts Range (un-beneficiated ore, crushed/ground feed) underwent Metallium's proprietary FJH process (Figure 2).\nTotal rare-earth oxide (TREO) content increased from ~1.7 % to ~35 % in a single FJH reaction step, representing ~20x upgrade (Table 1).\n\u00b7\nKey heavy REEs Dy and Tb, and magnet REE Nd concentrations increased significantly\n\u00b7\nDy\u2082O\u2083 upgraded 53\u00d7 (0.19% \u2192 10.03%) / 11% \u2192 29% of the REO basket (+160%)\n\u00b7\nTb\u2084O\u2087 upgraded 21\u00d7 (0.03% \u2192 0.64%) / 1.7% \u2192 1.8% of the REO basket (+5%)\n\u00b7\nNd\u2082O\u2083 upgraded 114\u00d7 (0.05% \u2192 5.69%) / 2.9% \u2192 16.3% of the REO basket (+460%)\n\u00b7\nComplete removal of detectable Fe\u2082O\u2083, SiO\u2082 and Th\n\u00b7\nPartial yttrium rejection, reducing Y\u2082O\u2083 from 61% to 35% of the REO basket\n\u00b7\nNo traditional acid-leach or reagent-heavy beneficiation route was applied pre-FJH, underscoring metallurgical simplicity and fast processing capability\nMTM is currently modelling the next phase of optimisation, including additional FJH treatment and post-sample processing for increased recoveries.\nMTM's Texas Technology Campus will be used to scale up the reactor size, optimise reactor parameters and deliver customer-qualification grade products.\nSamples were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by an independent, accredited commercial laboratory.\nFigure 2:\nSingle-step Flash Mass Balance Diagram (Source: Metallium)\nTable 1: REE Recovery and Impurity Removal - Assay Before and After FJH Treatment & Enrichment Ratio (Source: Metallium)\nFigure 3: Metallium's indicative operating model - exclusive processing rights over Harts Range enable a \"Processing-as-a-Service\" structure, generating both per-tonne licensing fees & production royalties without mining or operating risk (Source: Metallium)\nBinding Commercial Framework\nUnder the terms of the binding commercial framework, New Frontier has agreed to the following:\n\u00b7\nMTM has binding, exclusive, project-linked rights to apply FJH (and derivative processing) to all ore, concentrate or other feed from the Harts Range Project for a minimum of 10 years, with automatic rollover into production stage.\n\u00b7\nUpon commercial production of a Dy/Tb-rich product, MTM will earn:\no\na royalty (1.5% Net Smelter Return equivalent) on sales of finished product; and\no\na margin for processing Harts Range feed through MTM's facility.\n\u00b7\nThe structure includes a buy-back right allowing the project owner (or successor) to acquire a portion of the royalty for a fixed amount, enabling MTM to crystallise value.\n\u00b7\nMTM holds rights that travel with the project in the event of ownership change, ensuring the processing exclusivity remains intact.\nMTM's Texas Technology Campus serves dual purpose: core waste-to-value facility (e-waste, PCBs, speciality metals) and demonstration/refinement hub for HREE feedstocks and product qualification with U.S. / allied off-takers.\nStrategic Upside for New Frontier Through MTM Alignment\nBy exclusively aligning with MTM, which is positioning itself as a gatekeeper for heavy-rare-earth refining in the Western supply chain, New Frontier has a clear path to market for its unique Dy/Tb-rich feedstock.\nThe FJH process has now been demonstrated on Harts Range raw ore rather than just scraps or tailings - showing technology scalability and feed-type flexibility, increasing the addressable value chain.\nWith downstream product qualification pathways (including U.S. magnet and defence supply chains), New Frontier can leverage MTM's early upgrade results into commercial optionality, not just exploration upside.\nGiven global policy momentum toward allied-market rare-earth supply (including U.S. DoD and export-control tailwinds), the timing aligns with premium valuation themes for heavy-rare-earth exposures.\nDRILLING CAMPAIGN COMPLETED\nOn 3 November 2025, New Frontier announced a maiden RC drilling campaign, comprising up to 46 holes to test surface mineralisation at the Harts Range Heavy Rare Earth and Niobium Project, NT, had been finalised.\nOn 10 November 2025, New Frontier confirmed approval was granted by the NT Department of Mining and Energy enabling the inaugural drilling campaign at the Harts Range Project to progress. The main focus of the campaign was targeting multiple high-priority anomalies defined through regional geophysics, detailed geological mapping and surface geochemistry completed by the geology team over the past 12 months.\nThe campaign was designed to test the depth extension of the heavy rare earth mineralisation, with particular attention to dysprosium and terbium - critical elements in high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and advanced defence technologies.\nMeanwhile, following a comprehensive review, New Frontier applied to list on the US OTCQB market to enhance visibility and gain access to US investors wanting exposure to Australian explorers focused on critical minerals, especially heavy rare earth elements.\nOn 2 December 2025, New Frontier announced the commencement of its maiden ~2,500m reverse-circulation drill program at the Harts Range Project.\nShortly after 15 December 2025 (ASX Release date), the RC drilling campaign at the Harts Range Project was completed on time and within budget. Importantly, all high-priority targets were systematically drill-tested, to provide a strong geological understanding across the project area. The geology team is optimistic the insights from the drilling campaign will provide a significant understanding of the underlying heavy rare earths system, especially the extent of dysprosium and terbium mineralisation.\nSample batches were dispatched to ALS Adelaide for assay analysis, with results expected to deliver valuable insights into the scale and continuity of the heavy rare earth system.\nNWQ COPPER PROJECT\nOn 13 November 2025, New Frontier announced that it had lodged an MLA over the Big One Deposit, part of the NWQ Copper Project located circa 150 km north of Mount Isa, north-west Queensland.\nDevelopment plan\nThe MLA for the Big One Deposit (Figure 4) represents a significant milestone, strengthening New Frontier's position across the broader NWQ Copper Project, which lies within one of Australia's most proven districts for structurally controlled copper mineralisation. This proven district hosts multiple operating mines and development projects, providing New Frontier with access to established regional infrastructure and processing pathways.\nThe MLA is accompanied by an Initial Development Plan that outlines a potential mining scenario to guide future evaluation and regulatory assessment. The plan outlines a proposed open-cut operation designed to test and extract near-surface copper mineralisation. Under the initial Development Plan, preparatory earthworks are to commence in Q3 2026, with first production targeted for Q1 2027. These timelines are conceptual and subject to regulatory approvals, funding and technical studies.\nThe development plan proposes mining and haulage to the Mt Kelly Processing Facility (operated by Austral Resources).\nFigure 4: Plan view showing the proposed Big One Deposit MLA area and Year One activities, including the bulk sample zone, laydown area, stockpile, and access tracks\nAustral Resources MOU\nThe MLA builds on the MOU signed earlier this year between New Frontier and Austral Resources, which established a framework for evaluating toll treatment and ore supply opportunities at the Mt Kelly Copper Processing Facility. The lodgement of the MLA represents another step towards this collaboration, aligning with New Frontier's goal of progressing the Big One Deposit towards potential near-term development within the broader NWQ Copper Project.\nThe proposed operation is designed to leverage the site's existing footprint, including previously disturbed pits and infrastructure, minimising surface impact and supporting New Frontier's commitment to responsible development.\nCORPORATE ACTIVITY\nSuccessful Capital Raise\nOn 25 November 2025, New Frontier announced it had received firm commitments from new and existing investors to subscribe for A$2,250,000 (before costs) through a placement of 107,142,857 shares to professional and sophisticated investors at an issue price of $0.021 per share. Participants in the placement will receive, subject to shareholder approval, one free attaching option for every two new shares allocated in the placement, with an exercise price of $0.04 per option and a 2-year expiry from the date of issue.\nNew Appointments\nOn 3 December 2025, New Frontier confirmed retaining the technical and corporate services of senior consultant Kevin Das, a highly experienced geologist and mining executive with 24+ years across global jurisdictions. In addition, Joel Logan was promoted to Executive Director, strengthening operational oversight on the group's projects.\nThese appointments support NFM's objective to accelerate exploration, expand resource definition, and enhance long-term value creation.\nFINANCIAL UPDATE\nQuarterly Cash and Liquid Investments Position\nCash on hand and liquid investments at end of the quarter totalled $3.0 million (including cash on hand of $2.6m and ASX listed shares, as noted below).\nNFM holds 40 million Infinity Mining Limited (ASX: IMI) tradeable shares which have a total market value of ~$360,000 (40 million shares x $0.009 per share as at 31/12/2025) along with 20 million unlisted options (expiry 30/11/2029, strike $0.07).\nRehabilitation security bonds held at the end of the quarter totalled $125,000.\nSecurities on Issue at Quarter End\nOrdinary shares\n1,718,355,482\nOptions\n33,500,000\nPerformance rights\n25,500,000\nTo view Appendix 5B, which incorporates the quarterly cash flow report, click here:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/9737Q_1-2026-1-29.pdf\nInformation Required Under ASX Listing Rules\n1.
