The eight consecutive quarters of revenue growth that we have now reported provide us with confidence that our strategy is working and driving real momentum in the business.\nTrading momentum continuing to build\nOur revenue in H1 reached a new record level of \u00a334.1m, increasing by +20.6% year on year, with very strong like for like growth of +8.1%. This growth represents significant market outperformance, against the backdrop of stagnant retail sector sales and a challenging consumer environment.\nOur Retail channel has now delivered nine consecutive quarters of like for like growth, achieving +3.6% in H1. Total Retail revenue, increased by +21.8% year on year reflecting the benefit of the additional 14 new stores opened, less four closures, since the first half last year.\nEcommerce revenue grew by +18.4% year on year, with like for like growth of +15.7%. In addition to the strong performance from our website, Amazon UK contributed a further +2.7% of growth as the relaunch of this channel annualises.\nOur growing brand awareness is reflected in both our new customer acquisition and active customer numbers, with new records set in both metrics. During the first half we attracted 360,000 new customers to shop with us for the first time (+15.6% YoY), whilst our L12M active customers increased by +10.2% to 1.2 million at the end of the half.\nStrong promotional discipline and pricing optimisation, supported by product sourcing cost improvements, delivered our expected gross margin improvements, which increased by +130bps year on year.\nEBITDA of \u00a32.3m more than doubled YoY (H1 FY25: Underlying EBITDA \u00a31.0m). H1 operating loss was in line with our expectations at \u00a31.5m, 17.8% better than the underlying operating loss in the prior year, reflecting the benefit of revenue growth, improved gross profit margin and continued cost discipline, partly offset by \u00a30.6m dilution from investment in new store openings which is expected to reverse as the new stores progress towards maturity. Year on year, reported operating loss was 31.2% lower.\nH2 remains the Group's critical trading period and this seasonal weighting enhances operating leverage over our fixed cost base. We entered the peak season with a strengthened offering for Black Friday and the Christmas period, with a greater variety and depth of products curated for our customers and strong inventory levels secured to support further growth in this period of heightened consumer demand.\nSignificant strategic progress as we invest for growth\nWe are well on track to deliver our medium-term strategic plan of 100 UK stores, \u00a3100m of revenue and 10% operating profit margin, and our first half results reinforce our conviction in being able to realise significant value creation for all our stakeholders.\nWe successfully opened six new stores in the first half, expanding our retail estate to 71 stores after one closure (H1 FY25: 61).\nThe final opening of the first half, in the Birmingham Bullring, debuted our new store format. This format has been created with passionate home cooks in mind, providing greater inspiration and warmth, new product demonstration areas, and more premium fixtures to enable us to better showcase our expanding ranges.\nFour new format stores were opened as planned prior to Black Friday, and we\nare encouraged by their early performance and how well the new format has been received by customers.\nOur pipeline of new stores in target locations for the year ahead is forming well, with exciting opportunities to introduce more customers to ProCook as we progress towards 100 stores, and our strong cash generation is enabling us to self-fund investments in these opportunities when they present themselves.\nFrom a product perspective, we have continued to refresh ranges through the half, whilst improving our seasonal relevance with range launches and special buys through Summer and into Autumn. Our discipline around our promotional plan and trading calendar is resonating well with customers and supporting improved margins. We continue to be encouraged with the performance of our Electricals range, with revenue up over 80% YoY in the first half, supported by the return of coffee machines into stock during H1 following far greater than expected demand after their launch in Q4 FY25.\nWe have invested in new training and development activities during the first half, particularly for our retail teams. Our new Selling and Service training programme was rolled out across the teams by our field-based retail trainers during Q2, along with new reward schemes to better incentivise strong performance. Early results are encouraging with retail conversion rate increasing by +3.1% and average transaction value increasing by +1.5% year on year.\nHaving delivered strong results from expanding our marketing via social media channels last year, we have continued to accelerate in the first half of this year with attributed revenue from social marketing increasing by 153% in H1 whilst we also reduced paid media cost per acquisition by 38% year on year. Organic social engagement continues to grow with followers +38% YoY and engagement rate +48% YoY. We have also invested in our content creation capability centrally to ensure we are building on this success with tailored content which resonates with different audiences across multiple channels.\nEncouraging early peak season trading; confidence in delivering a strong full year performance\nOur performance in the first eight weeks of the second half, which includes Black Friday and early Christmas trading, has been strong, with accelerated trading momentum and continued growth in our customer base. Total revenue increased by +28.4%, including +18.2% like for like growth, with expanded Black Friday and Christmas campaigns driving continued market outperformance.\nRetail revenue increased by +26.9%, with like for like revenue growing +9.8% year on year driven by increases in footfall, average basket value and conversion. Ecommerce revenue increased by 30.6%, with continued benefit from strategic investment in social marketing and content creation. LFL revenue increased by +29.0% YoY and the Amazon UK marketplace contributed an additional +160bps.\nThe Group has delivered strong growth in the year to date, outperforming the market whilst making significant progress with our strategic priorities, which is testament to our colleagues' incredible drive and commitment.\nOur momentum has continued to build, with record numbers of customers discovering the brand for the first time and enjoying our award-winning quality products and service, and our growing active customer base generating higher repeat purchases. We have increased our retail footprint with 10 new stores since the beginning of the financial year in leading, high footfall destinations, and enhanced our product offering with increased seasonal relevance and more compelling value.\nThis progress, demonstrated by our results, reinforces our confidence in delivering our medium-term ambition of 100 UK retail stores, \u00a3100m revenue and 10% operating profit margin, and underpins our confidence in delivering a strong full year performance, in line with market expectations.\nLee Tappenden\nCEO\n10 December 2025\nCFO's Review\nWe have delivered a strong performance in the first half, continuing to outperform the kitchenware market and grow our customer base, with excellent like for like growth and record first half revenue.\nWe continue to invest in the areas which will deliver profitable growth for the long term, progressing our store expansion programme with disciplined site selection resulting in 6 new stores being opened in the first half with a further four opened by Black Friday. Investment in paid social marketing has expanded our reach, introducing our brand to more consumers, and we have delivered this while also improving our Ecommerce marketing efficiency.\nThe larger and profitable second half of the year remains of critical importance for us, and with strong inventory levels and a robust trading plan in place, we have performance well during the early peak season and are well placed to capitalise on the significant consumer activity throughout the Black Friday and Christmas trading periods, as we continue to execute our medium-term goals.\nRevenue\n\u00a3m\n/ %\nH1 FY26\n\u00a3m\nH1 FY25\n\u00a3m\nYoY growth\n%\nRevenue\n34.1\n28.3\n20.6%\nEcommerce\n11.8\n10.0\n18.4%\nRetail\n22.3\n18.3\n21.8%\nLFL Revenue\n29.1\n26.7\n8.1%\nEcommerce\n11.6\n9.9\n15.7%\nRetail\n17.6\n16.8\n3.6%\nTotal revenue in H1 of \u00a334.1m increased by +20.6% year on year, and +8.1% on a like for like basis, reflecting continued trading momentum and market outperformance.\nEcommerce revenue increased by +18.4%, with like for like revenue growth of +15.7%, as our direct website performance continues to grow, supported by significant improvements in social media marketing capability, the retail expansion halo effect, and increased average order values year on year.\nRetail revenue increased by +21.8%, benefitting from the ninth consecutive quarter of positive like for like growth (+3.6% for the first half) and the impact of new store openings. At the end of the half year, our retail estate comprised of 71 stores after one closure (FY25 H1: 61).\nGross profit\nGross profit increased +22.8% year on year to \u00a322.7m, driven mainly by revenue growth, but also reflecting a gross profit margin increase of +130bps driven by strong promotional discipline and pricing optimisation (+130bps), product sourcing cost improvements (+80bps), and favourable FX impacts (+60bps), partly offset by increased freight and logistics costs (-120bps) and product mix effect (-20bps).\nOperating expenses and other income\nReported operating expenses net of other income\nTotal reported operating expenses net of other income were \u00a324.1m (H1 FY25: \u00a320.5m) representing 70.6% of sales (H1 FY25: 72.6%), reflecting our ongoing cost discipline as we support growing revenues. The following were the key drivers of cost increases:\n\u00b7\nInvestment in new and maturing stores, including pre-opening costs: +\u00a32.8m\n\u00b7\nExisting store costs: +\u00a30.3m\n\u00b7\nPayroll inflation and reward investment: +\u00a30.6m\n\u00b7\nEcommerce order volume growth: +\u00a30.8m\n\u00b7\nEcommerce marketing and logistics efficiency: -\u00a30.9m\n\u00b7\nInvestment in capability: -\u00a30.3m\nNon-underlying operating expenses\nWe have not reported any non-underlying operating expenses in H1 FY26. H1 FY25 reflected non-underlying operating expenses of \u00a30.3m in relation to the final elements of IPO-related share-based payments.\nThe Group does not currently anticipate reporting any non-underlying items in FY26.\nOperating profit / (loss)\nOperating loss improved by \u00a30.6m year on year to \u00a31.5m for the first half (H1 FY25: Reported \u00a32.1m, underlying \u00a31.8m). Ecommerce operating margins increased to 28.1% (H1 FY25: 18.8%) driven by improved gross margins and marketing efficiency gains, whilst Retail operating margins decreased to 6.7% (H1 FY25: 11.9%) primarily due to a \u00a30.6m dilutive impact in H1 FY26 compared to H1 FY25, of the 14 new store openings since H1 FY25 which have not yet reached maturity.\n\u00a3m\nH1 FY26\nH1 FY25\nOperating profit\u00a0/ (loss)\nEcommerce\n3.3\n1.9\nRetail\n1.5\n2.2\nCentral\n(6.3)\n(5.9)\nNon-underlying items\n-\n(0.3)\nTotal\n(1.5)\n(2.1)\nAs a % of revenue\nEcommerce\n28.1%\n18.8%\nRetail\n6.7%\n11.9%\nCentral\n(18.4%)\n(20.6%)\nNon-underlying items\n-\n(1.2%)\nTotal\n(4.2%)\n(7.4%)\nProfit and earnings per share\nDuring the first half there was a net expense of \u00a31.5m (H1 FY25: \u00a31.1m) in respect of financial items. Financial items included interest expenses on lease liabilities and borrowings of \u00a30.8m (H1 FY25: \u00a30.7m), and other losses of \u00a30.7m in respect of foreign exchange movements (H1 FY25: \u00a30.4m).\nH1 loss before tax was \u00a32.9m (H1 FY25: \u00a33.2m, Underlying \u00a32.9m). Reported loss after tax was \u00a32.1m (H1 FY25: \u00a32.5m, Underlying \u00a32.2m).\nThe effective tax rate based on reported loss before tax was 25.0% (H1 FY24: 25%).\nEarnings per Share\nReported basic earnings per share for the first half were -2.03 pence (H1 FY2: -2.30 pence) and reported diluted earnings per share were -2.03 pence (H1 FY25: -2.30 pence).\nCash generation and net debt\nNet debt at the period end was \u00a34.1m, a reduction of \u00a30.1m from last year (H1 FY25: \u00a34.2m) despite increasing investment in capital expenditure to \u00a32.3m (H1 FY25: \u00a31.3m), primarily in new stores.\nNet working capital also increased in the first half to \u00a31.4m (H1 FY25: \u00a30.3m) reflecting the higher store count year on year, and requirement to build inventory ahead of our busiest trading period.\nThis resulted in free cash out flow for the first half of \u00a35.0m (H1 FY25: outflow of \u00a33.4m). All of the \u00a31.6m increased cash outflow year on year can be attributed to increased cash investment in new store openings.

Additionally, the RCF agreement provides an accordion option, subject to the lender's approval, to extend the facility by a further \u00a35.0m.\nThe Group also retains its access to an existing uncommitted \u00a36.0m trade finance facility, which is due to expire on 28 February 2026 although is expected to be renewed at that date.\nDividends\nIn order to ensure that planned growth investment continues to be self-funded, in areas such as new stores, which will support improved future profitability and cash generation, the Board is not recommending an interim dividend in respect of FY26.\nThe full capital and dividend policy is available on the Group's website at www.procookgroup.co.uk.\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nThe Board regularly reviews and monitors the risks and uncertainties which could have a material effect on the Group's results. A summary of the principal risks is set out below:\nRisk\nImpact\nStrategy and business change\nFailure to identify and successfully execute appropriate strategies to develop and grow the brand over the medium to long term could be affected by a range of factors including changes in competition or products, consumer behaviours and trends, inadequate change management or leadership. This could slow or limit the growth of the business, distract from and / or damage the overall customer proposition, incur additional cost or serve to demotivate colleagues if not led effectively.\nCompetition,market andmacroeconomic\nFailure to adapt to changing consumer needs given external macro factors, and to maintain a compelling customer offer compared to competitors could limit or reduce profitability and opportunities for growth.

The registered office is ProCook,\n10 Indurent Park, Gloucester, GL10 3EZ.\nThe principal activity of the Company together with its subsidiary undertakings throughout the period is the sale of kitchenware and related products in stores and via ecommerce platforms.\nThe Group's financial results and cashflows are subject to seasonal trends throughout the financial period. Typically, revenue and profit are higher in the last 24 weeks of the financial year due to the seasonal impact of increased trade in the run up to Christmas.\nBasis of preparation\nThese condensed interim financial statements for the 28 weeks ended 12 October 2025 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim financial information\". These condensed interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 and are not audited.\nThe condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 March 2025, which were prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, UK-adopted IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nStatutory financial statements for the period ended 30 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 24 June 2025\nand delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\nThe auditors have reported on those financial statements; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe presentation of the condensed financial statements requires Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nBasis of consolidation\nGroup companies included in these consolidated interim financial statements include ProCook Group plc and all subsidiary undertakings, which are those entities it controls. ProCook Group plc controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and can affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to ProCook Group plc until the date that control ceases. The Company assesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes in the control indicators listed above.\nTransactions eliminated on consolidation\nIntra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the financial information. Losses are eliminated in the same way as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\nGoing concern\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group had net debt (cash and cash equivalents less borrowings) of \u00a34.1m at 12 October 2025 (13 October 2024: \u00a34.2m) with available liquidity headroom in cash and facilities of \u00a311.9m.\nThe Group's latest forecast for the 12-month period from the date of approval of these financial statements, used to support the assessment of going concern, incorporates the Group's latest projections in respect of trading performance, investments and resulting cashflows, taking into account the Group's medium-term plan and the current economic conditions. The Group has modelled a variety of downside scenarios, and in each of these the Group remains comfortably within the available liquidity of its current facilities and in compliance with all related covenants.\nAs a result, the Board expects the Group to have adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of at least 12 months from the date of approving these financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis of accounting.\nAccounting policies\nThe condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and share based payments which are stated at their fair value. The accounting policies adopted, as well as significant judgements and key estimates applied, are consistent with those in the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 March 2025, as described in those financial statements.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the 28 weeks to 12 October 2025\n1. Revenue\nGroup revenue is not reliant on any single major customer or group of customers. Management considers revenue is derived from one business stream being the retail of kitchenware and related products and services.\nCustomers interact and shop with the Group across multiple touchpoints and their journey often involves more than one channel. The Chief Operating Decision-Maker is the Board of Directors of ProCook Group plc. The Board reviews internal management reports on a frequent basis, and in line with internal reporting, the channel reporting below indicates where customers complete their final purchase transaction.\n28 weeks ended\n28 weeks ended\n52 weeks ended\n\u00a3'000\n12 October 2025\n13 October 2024\n30 March 2025\nUnited Kingdom\n34,140\n28,312\n69,493\nTotal revenue\n34,140\n28,312\n69,493\n2.

Segmental reporting\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) has been identified as the Board of Directors and segmental reporting analysis is presented based on the Group's internal reporting to the Board. At 12 October 2025, the Group had two operating segments, being Ecommerce and Retail. Central costs are reported separately to the Board. Whilst central costs are not considered to be an operating segment, it has been included below to aid reconciliation with operating profit as presented in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n28 weeks ended\n28 weeks ended\n52 weeks ended\n\u00a3'000\n12 October 2025\n13 October 2024\n30 March 2025\nRevenue\nEcommerce\n11,813\n9,979\n25,476\nRetail\n22,327\n18,333\n44,017\nTotal revenue\n34,140\n28,312\n69,493\nOperating (loss)/profit\nEcommerce\n3,319\n1,875\n6,676\nRetail\n1,497\n2,186\n8,824\nCentral costs\n(6,266)\n(5,825)\n(12,293)\nNon-underlying costs\n-\n(342)\n(344)\nOperating (loss)/profit\n(1,450)\n(2,106)\n2,863\nFinance costs\n(829)\n(742)\n(1,415)\nOther (losses)\n(657)\n(377)\n(272)\n(Loss)/profit before tax\n(2,936)\n(3,225)\n1,176\nSubstantially all of the assets of the Group are located in the UK.\n4.

Dividends\nNo final dividend was declared in respect of the period ended 30 March 2025 and the Directors have not declared an interim dividend in respect of the current half year period.\n6. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.\n28 weeks ended\n28 weeks ended\n52 weeks ended\n12 October 2025\n13 October 2024\n30 March 2025\nWeighted average number of shares\n108,956,624\n108,956,624\n108,956,624\nImpact of share options\n10,051,030\n8,452,918\n8,634,223\nNumber of shares for diluted earnings per share\n119,007,654\n117,409,542\n1167,590,847\n28 weeks ended\n28 weeks ended\n52 weeks ended\n12 October 2025\n13 October 2024\n30 March 2025\n\u00a3'000\nReported\nUnderlying1\nReported\nUnderlying1\nReported\nLoss/profit for the period\n(2,207)\n(2,163)\n(2,505)\n1,273\n1,002\nEarnings per ordinary share - basic\n(2.03)p\n(1.98)p\n(2.30)p\n1.17p\n0.92p\nEarnings per ordinary share - diluted2\n(2.03)p\n(1.98)p\n(2.30)p\n1.08p\n0.85p\n1\nUnderlying earnings per ordinary share is a non-IFRS measure.\n2\nIn the 28 weeks ended 12 October 2025 and 13 October 2024 the impact of share options was anti-dilutive.\n7.

At 12 October 2025, the outstanding contracts all mature within 28 months of the period end, with committed purchases of\n$46.1m (30 March 2025: $34.6m).\nThe contracts are measured at their fair value, which is determined using valuation techniques that utilise observable inputs. The key inputs used in valuing the derivatives are the forward exchange rates. There were no designated hedges in place during the current or proceeding financial year.\nThe fair value of derivative financial liabilities, included within Trade and other payables, are as follows:\nAs at 12 October\nAs at 13 October\nAs at 30 March\n\u00a3'000\n2025\n2024\n2025\nDerivatives\n575\n341\n177\nTotal\n575\n341\n177\n12. Financial risk management\nFinancial risk management\nThe Group is exposed through its operation to the following financial risks: credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk. Risk management is carried out by the Directors of the Group. The Group uses financial instruments to provide flexibility regarding its working capital requirements and to enable it to manage specific financial risks to which it is exposed.\nThe Group finances its operations through a mixture of debt finance, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade debtors and trade payables which arise directly from the Business's operations.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. To minimise the risk, the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy and this, together with the aggregate financial exposure, is continuously monitored. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of its financial receivables, trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the notes to the financial information.\nThe receivables' age analysis is evaluated on a regular basis for potential doubtful debts, considering historic, current, and forward-looking information. No impairments to trade receivables have been made to date. Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables are provided within the notes to financial statements.\nCredit risk also arises on cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating \"B+\" are accepted.\nCurrently all financial institutions whereby the Group holds significant levels of cash are rated A+ to A-.\nInterest rate risk\nAs at 12 October 2025 the Group's drawn borrowings are through its trade finance facility with a floating interest rate linked to the United States Federal funds rate and its revolving credit facility with a floating interest rate linked to the Bank of England base rate. Both are variable on the amount drawn down and there is no fixed settlement date, therefore the interest rate risk exposure for the Group is minimal. The Group's policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial borrowings. The Group does not currently use any form of derivatives to manage interest rate volatility or future rate increases, however it does seek to minimise interest costs through careful management of its use of facilities.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk arises when the Group enters transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. The Group's policy is, where possible, to settle liabilities denominated in a currency other than its functional currency with cash already denominated in that currency.\nThe Group makes purchases of goods and services from overseas in foreign currencies and uses additional means to cover its exposure to the foreign exchange movement. The Group uses various financial derivatives such as forward exchange contracts, to help mitigate movements in foreign currency to restrict losses and to ascertain control of expected cash out flows. All the Group's foreign exchange contracts are designated to settle the corresponding liability.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Group seeks to maintain sufficient cash balances to support its working capital and investment requirements. Management reviews cash flow forecasts on a regular basis to determine whether the Group has sufficient cash available to support its operational and investment activities.\n13. Related parties\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.\nTransactions with Life's a Beach, a related party by virtue of one of the Group's Directors during the period (Daniel O'Neill) being a trustee, relate to charitable donations made on ProCook sales and other associated transactions. During the period, ProCook sales generated \u00a322k of donations payable to Life's a Beach (28 weeks ending 13 October 2024: \u00a319k). During the period ending 12 October 2025, ProCook made payments totalling \u00a317k to Life's a Beach (28 weeks ending 13 October 2024: \u00a355k). The amount payable at 12 October 2025 was \u00a314k (13 October 2024: \u00a313k).\nTransactions with Conway House Limited, a related party by virtue of one of the Group's Directors (Daniel O'Neill) being a Director of the company, related in prior year to the provision of advisory services to the Group. No services were provided by Conway House in the period (28 weeks ending 13 October 2024: \u00a369k). Payments to Conway House totalled nil during the period (28 weeks ending 13 October 2024: \u00a347k). The amount payable at 12 October 2025 was nil (28 weeks ending 13 October 2024: \u00a322k).\n14. Subsequent events\nThe Group has monitored trading performance, internal activities, as well as other relevant external factors throughout the period from the balance sheet date to the date of approving these interim financial statements. No material changes in critical estimates and judgements have been identified as adjusting post balance sheet events and there have been no material non-adjusting events since 12 October 2025.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The new stores are located in some of the UK's most prominent retail destinations: Manchester Arndale, Birmingham Bullring, Canterbury, Plymouth and Eastbourne. They join the five stores already opened in FY26 - Southampton, Hereford, Reading, Cotswolds Designer Outlet and Chichester - and will increase the total retail estate to 75 stores across the UK.\nThe five new openings demonstrate further strong progress against ProCook's medium-term target of 100 stores nationwide. Since setting out its estate expansion strategy in June 2024, ProCook will have opened 22 stores and invested \u00a37.0 million to grow its presence in prime retail locations.\nTogether, the ten FY26 openings provide exposure to more than 120 million visitors annually. Manchester Arndale alone attracts over 45 million visitors each year and will become the company's second location in the city following its Trafford Centre opening in late 2023. The upcoming Birmingham Bullring opening will give ProCook its third location in the UK's second-largest city and access to over 35 million annual visitors, following the opening of two new stores in Solihull and Merry Hill last year.\nThe majority of these new locations are larger-format stores designed to offer customers more space to explore ProCook's expanding range, including its growing line of small kitchen electricals. The Birmingham Bullring store will also debut a refreshed store format, reflecting the Company's ongoing commitment to delivering an inspiring experienced-focused customer journey.\nThe store expansion programme has created over 150 new jobs across the UK so far, further supporting local economies and strengthening ProCook's nationwide presence.\nLee Tappenden, CEO, commented:\n\"The five new additions to our store estate mark further strong progress and momentum towards our 100 stores ambition. With each new location, we're not only expanding our footprint but also bringing the ProCook experience to more customers in some of the UK's busiest shopping destinations. Our investment in our store estate reflects our confidence in physical retail and its role in showcasing our growing range - including our newest electrical products - in an engaging way. We're excited to build on this momentum as we head into the key Christmas trading period and beyond into 2026.\"\nENDS\nMedia contacts\nMHP Group -\nprocook@mhpgroup.com\nStores to be opened before Christmas trading in FY26:\nLocation\nCentre\nExpected opening\nBirmingham\nBullring\nOctober\nCanterbury\nWhitefriars\nOctober\nPlymouth\nDrakes Circus\nOctober\nManchester\nArndale\nNovember\nEastbourne\nBeacon\nNovember\nStores already opened in FY26:\nLocation\nCentre\nSouthampton\nWestquay\nHereford\nOld Market\nReading\nOracle\nCotswolds\nCotswolds Designer Outlet\nChichester\nNorth St\nNotes to editors:\nProCook is the UK's leading direct-to-consumer specialist kitchenware brand.

These new stores are in popular regional retail destination centres which benefit from strong visitor numbers that will support increased awareness of our brand. Performance of the four new stores since opening is encouraging.\nWe have launched phase three of our new Electricals range during the summer and performance in this new category is supporting growth. We will be launching phase four (our new range of coffee machines and accessories) as planned during H2.\nWe continue to make good headway in improving omnichannel service and in growing our customer base, as well as strong progress with our supply chain transformation programme which will deliver operating efficiencies and improved availability for our customers.\nWe are well positioned for peak with enhanced Black Friday and Christmas campaigns planned, and strong inventory levels which we have prudently secured in advance given the significant disruption to the global freight markets.\nThe Board is confident in the Group's unique own-brand and direct-sourced operating model and is encouraged by the continued momentum in trading performance and the strong strategic progress made in recent months.

Total LFL revenue was similar year on year in the quarter at -0.4%, building on the improving trend in previous quarters (Q1: -7.9%, Q2: -1.8%).\nEcommerce LFL revenue was -5.1% in Q3, reflecting disruption during the first 6 weeks of the quarter following the launch of the new website at the end of Summer, which was largely resolved in time for Black Friday campaigns and benefiting, in the latter part of the quarter, from the prior year adverse impact of home delivery strikes.\nRetail revenue growth of 9.5% in Q3 benefited from the opening of two new stores in the quarter, as well as continued momentum in LFL revenue with growth of 3.1%.\nAt the end of the third quarter, the Group held a net cash position of \u00a32.6m (FY23 Q3: \u00a33.1m) with available liquidity of \u00a318.6m.\nOutlook\nTrading during the important peak period has been in line with the Board's expectations. However, the macro environment remains difficult for consumers, impacting bigger ticket and discretionary purchases. Nevertheless, the Group has made good progress with improving customer experience both online and in store and enhancing value for customers through price reductions across much of our range, supported by year on year cost reductions and efficiency improvements.\nWhilst mindful of the geopolitical impact on supply chains as shipments avoid the Suez canal, which has the potential to cause disruption and increase costs if sustained over a prolonged period, we are well placed in the short term due to strong levels of inventory availability across the product range.\nWe remain confident that, as a specialist retailer, our high-quality and carefully curated product range which is 100% direct-sourced and own-brand, paired with our excellent customer service both in store and online, stands us apart from our competitors. We are making good strategic progress in building a stronger customer-focused business ready to accelerate as conditions improve, to deliver profitable and sustainable growth for all stakeholders.\nLee Tappenden, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"I am pleased that trading metrics are continuing to improve despite the difficult consumer backdrop, and that we have delivered a robust Black Friday and Christmas trading period, outperforming our market.\n\"Whilst we remain cautious about the timing and pace of market recovery, we are confident in our proposition and energised by the opportunities available to us to build an even stronger customer-focused business as we continue to make good strategic progress which will allow us to accelerate profitable growth as trading conditions improve.\"\n1\nYoY reflects year on year performance between the relevant financial periods of FY24 (52 weeks ending 31 March 2024) and FY23 (52 weeks ended 2 April 2023).\n2\nLFL (Like For Like) revenue reflects:\n-\nEcommerce LFL - ProCook direct website channel only.\n-\nRetail LFL\n- Continuing Retail stores which were trading for at least one full financial year prior to the 2 April 2023, inclusive of any stores which may have moved location or increased/ decreased footprint within a given retail centre.\n3\nUK Kitchenware market growth (excluding ProCook) calculated using weekly GfK data and management estimates\nFor further information please contact:\nProCook Group plc\nLee Tappenden, Chief Executive Officer\nDan Walden, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@procook.co.uk\nMHP Group (Financial PR Adviser)\nKatie Hunt\nCatherine Chapman\nprocook@mhpgroup.com\nTel: +44 (0)7711 191 518\nNext scheduled event:\nProCook expects to release its FY24 Q4 trading update in mid-April 2024.\nNotes to editors:\nProCook is the UK's leading direct-to-consumer specialist kitchenware brand.

Like for like revenue was -1.8% in quarter two, with improvements in both Ecommerce and Retail channels compared to quarter one (Q1: -7.9%). We have also seen a continuation of the channel shift back towards physical Retail stores that we have experienced over the last two years.\nThe second quarter results reflect a strong Summer Sale performance during July and August, aided by considerably more favourable weather year on year. Trading in September and into early October has been markedly softer, with lower footfall and traffic, and customers increasingly seeking out greater value and promotional offers.\nFirst half revenue of \u00a326.3m was -3.8% year on year, or -1.2% excluding the exit from Amazon EU during the last financial year. On a like for like basis, first half revenue was -4.4% year on year, an improving trend compared to prior year (H1: -16.2%, H2: -5.9%).\nNet debt at the end of the first half was \u00a33.2m (FY23 year end: \u00a32.8m) with available liquidity of \u00a312.8m.\nOutlook\nWe have made strong progress with our strategic priorities in the first half of the year, launching phase one of our new Electricals range in August, transitioning to our new website during September, and launching our new brand campaigns featuring celebrity chef Matt Tebbutt this week. We are focused on providing even greater value to our customers through our direct sourced own-brand business model, underpinned by service excellence, whilst maintaining cost discipline across our business operations.\nThe Group typically generates around 60% of full year sales in the second half of the financial year. We are well prepared for this peak trading period, with strong product availability and offers planned.\nHowever, the Board remains cautious with regards to the FY24 outlook given the highly challenging market conditions which persist, and the current trading volatility and sales trends over recent weeks, with customers seeking more value and taking more time to research before committing to purchase.\nWhilst forecasting the specific timing and pace of the market recovery is challenging, the Board is confident it will recover given the attractive market dynamics. When it does recover, the Board believes ProCook is well positioned to deliver improved financial performance and further market share gains given the strength of the brand and operating model.\nLee Tappenden, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"My first few weeks with ProCook have reinforced my appreciation of our unique customer proposition, product quality and service excellence across our business. I am highly excited by the many opportunities we have to further develop our proposition and business in the next chapter ahead of us.\n\"Trading conditions remain challenging, and we continue to operate in an uncertain consumer and macroeconomic environment. We are focussed on delivering even greater value for our customers throughout the important peak\ntrading period\nand beyond.\n\"We continue to build on ProCook's strong foundations to strengthen our proposition and brand awareness, expand our product range and store portfolio, and invest in the areas that will improve our operational efficiency and capacity. This will leave us well placed to capture the many growth opportunities available to us as trading conditions improve.\"\n1\nYoY reflects year on year performance between the relevant financial periods of FY24 (52 weeks ending 31 March 2024) and FY23 (52 weeks ended 2 April 2023).\n2\nLFL (Like For Like) revenue reflects:\n-\nEcommerce LFL - ProCook direct website channel only.\n-\nRetail LFL\n- Continuing Retail stores which were trading for at least one full financial year prior to the 2 April 2023, inclusive of any stores which may have moved location or increased/ decreased footprint within a given retail centre.\nFor further information please contact:\nProCook Group plc\nLee Tappenden, Chief Executive Officer\nDan Walden, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@procook.co.uk\nMHP Group (Financial PR Adviser)\nKatie Hunt\nCatherine Chapman\nprocook@mhpgroup.com\nTel: +44 (0)7711 191 518\nNext scheduled event:\nProCook expects to release its FY24 interim res",

The Board has conducted a thorough external search process, as part of the Group's succession planning, following on from Daniel O'Neill's indication earlier this year of his intention to step back from the CEO role, as set out in the Group's preliminary results announcement on 28 June 2023. Lee is expected to join the Group and Board in early October 2023.\nLee brings extensive leadership, retail and consumer experience, having spent over 25 years with Walmart Stores and Asda, where he held a range of senior management roles. His tenure included roles in merchandising and operations, before becoming Chief Operations Officer, and then President and CEO of Walmart Canada.\nHe is currently the President at Amyris International, part of the Nasdaq-listed synthetic biology company which produces sustainable beauty and health ingredients and operates its own family of consumer brands. Lee has driven its international expansion, through developing strategic retailer partnerships, and its direct-to-consumer ecommerce and brand marketing capabilities.\nDaniel will remain in the role of CEO until Lee joins the Group, and will be available as required to support an orderly transition. Having founded ProCook over 27 years ago, the Group will continue to benefit from Daniel's deep knowledge of the business. He will remain on the Board, transitioning to a Non-Executive Director role, supporting the Group's continued development, with a particular focus on his passion for continually improving the product range.\nGreg Hodder, Chairman, commented:\n\"I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Lee as our new CEO. With his extensive leadership, retail and consumer background, his experience will be invaluable in leading ProCook through its next stage of development as we grow the business.\n\"I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise everything Daniel has done as the Founder and leader of this business over the last 27 years, most recently culminating in the Group's IPO in 2021 and subsequently navigating the challenging market conditions over the last 18 months. He is responsible for creating ProCook and is an outstanding entrepreneur. He will continue to add value to ProCook through his passion for the business and its products, and I look forward to our continued work together over the years ahead.\"\nDaniel O'Neill, CEO, commented:\n\"I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished with the business over the last 27 years, now is the right time for me to hand over the reins to a new CEO. Lee brings with him a passion for what we have already created and is excited about opportunity to lead ProCook on the next stage of its journey. His extensive experience in retailing, specifically in a direct to consumer environment and in delivering growth, made Lee the perfect choice. I very much look forward to working with him and remain fully committed to supporting ProCook's continued growth and performance.\"\nLee Tappenden, CEO designate, commented:\n\"I am very excited to be joining the business at this stage; still in its infancy as a listed company and with considerable potential for sustainable, long-term growth. Whilst we are operating in difficult macroeconomic conditions, substantial work has been done by the existing team to ensure ProCook emerges stronger, and I look forward to building on this excellent platform.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nProCook Group plc\nDaniel O'Neill, Chief Executive Officer & Founder\nDan Walden, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@procook.co.uk\nMHP Group (Financial PR Adviser)\nKatie Hunt\nCatherine Chapman\nprocook@mhpgroup.com\nTel: +44 (0)7711 191 518\nNotes to editors:\nProCook is the UK's leading direct-to-consumer specialist kitchenware brand.

Revenue of \u00a310.7m was 6.7% lower year on year with LFL revenue down 7.9% year on year impacted by the warm weather and soft homewares market during May and June. Our share of the market5 has remained flat year on year during the first quarter. Excluding the impact of discontinued Amazon channels, total revenue was down 3.9% year on year.\nThe market led shift back towards retail shopping and away from online has continued in the first quarter. Our retail stores continue to outperform online, with 0.2% growth in retail like for like revenue in the first quarter, and total retail revenue growth of 7.3%. Revenue from our website was down 18.8% year on year, partly impacted by a higher level of promotional activity last year.\nThe outlook remains challenging and much is uncertain. While there are indications that inflationary pressures will ease over the months ahead, UK consumers have suffered a significant adverse impact on disposable incomes and discretionary spending power.\nDespite this, we see clear opportunities ahead of us to attract more customers to the ProCook brand and grow our market share, by building a better business through developing our products, service and operating model, thereby emerging stronger from this challenging period.\nDaniel O'Neill, CEO and Founder, commented:\n\"In the 27 years since we first founded ProCook our focus on product quality, value and service have served as the key pillars of our customer offer, and I am pleased that this year we have again increased our active customer base, added three more retail stores and upsized two more, and retained our excellent-rated Trustpilot score. Our value for money offer has enabled us to retain a resilient trading performance despite the many headwinds.\n\"This year the economic backdrop has been one of the toughest I have experienced in my career. Our customers and colleagues have felt the squeeze on disposable incomes as inflation has soared upwards. We have faced challenging trading conditions before, and emerged stronger, more nimble, and more determined to press ahead with our mission to become the customers' first choice for kitchenware.\n\"I am pleased with the strong strategic progress we have made this year, despite the challenging economic backdrop.

Excluding revenue from discontinued Amazon channels, Ecommerce LFL revenue for Q4 was -12.6%, contributing to a total LFL revenue decline of -9.4%, although this remained +103.2% compared to FY20 (pre-pandemic).\nFull year revenue of \u00a362.3m was in the middle of our expected range, declining -9.9% year on year, or -5.0% excluding the discontinued Amazon channels.\nDuring the quarter we opened one new store in Kingston Upon Thames, increasing the total number of retail stores to 58 at the year end (FY22: 55). We also completed the development of our new Distribution Centre and HQ which will support future operational efficiencies as we grow, and began the transition into the site during March.\nWe are pleased to have been recognised recently by Which? as a Recommended Provider (Furniture and Homeware), ranking 4th amongst a large peer group based on customer feedback, noting particularly our product quality and range.\nThe Board anticipates that FY23 underlying PBT will be approximately breakeven, in line with our previous guidance\n.\nDaniel O'Neill, Chief Executive Officer & Founder, commented:\n\"The last year has been very difficult for consumers as real disposable incomes have fallen, which is reflected in our softer sales performance against our significant growth and market outperformance last year.\n\"While we expect trading conditions to remain challenging and unpredictable, we continue to grow our customer base by attracting new customers to the brand and remain confident in our value-for-money, specialist offer. Certain inflationary cost pressures, including wages, remain high, however we are seeing some easing in other areas, and we expect to realise the benefits\nof our recent actions to reduce operating costs in the current financial year and beyond.\n\"In our 27-year history, we have endured difficult trading conditions before and emerged stronger. We have made good strategic progress this year, investing in areas that will strengthen our foundations and improve our customer proposition. We therefore look forward with confidence to building the ProCook brand, equipping more customers with the tools to enjoy everyday cooking, and returning to profitable growth.\"\n1\nYoY reflects year on year performance between the relevant financial periods of FY23 (52 weeks ending 2 April 2023) and FY22 (52 weeks ended 3 April 2022).\n2\nYo3Y reflects year on year performance between the relevant financial periods of FY23 and FY20 (pre-pandemic).\n3\nLFL (Like For Like) revenue reflects:\n-\nRetail YoY\n- Continuing Retail stores which were trading for at least one full financial year prior to the 3 April 2022, inclusive of any stores which may have moved location or increased/ decreased footprint within a given retail centre.\n-\nRetail Yo3Y\n- Continuing Retail stores which were trading for at least one full financial year prior to the 29 March 2020, inclusive of any stores which may have moved location or increased/ decreased footprint within a given retail centre.\n-\nEcommerce YoY and Yo3Y - ProCook direct website channel only.\nFor further information please contact:\nProCook Group plc\nDaniel O'Neill, Chief Executive Officer & Founder\nDan Walden, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@procook.co.uk\nMHP Group (Financial PR Adviser)\nKatie Hunt\nCatherine Chapman\nprocook@mhpgroup.com\nTel: +44 (0)7711 191 518\nNext scheduled event:\nProCook expects to release its FY23 preliminary results in late June 2023.\nNotes to editors:\nProCook is the UK's leading direct-to-consumer specialist kitchenware brand.

Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

They sent a full replacement because they don't have spare bowls as they don't normally break. Note you are not supposed to fully immerse the bowl when cleaning IF the bowl is not fully glazed, which they tend not to be around the base. Supposedly the base takes in water that causes it to break.",

          "content": "Snippet from article For the year to March 2025, Canaccord Genuity forecasts an uptick in adjusted pre-tax profit from \u00a31 million to \u00a32.5 million, ahead of \u00a33.8 million in 2026, with EPS (earnings per share) building from 1.6p this year to 2.4p next year. Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

They sent a full replacement because they don't have spare bowls as they don't normally break. Note you are not supposed to fully immerse the bowl when cleaning IF the bowl is not fully glazed, which they tend not to be around the base. Supposedly the base takes in water that causes it to break.",

          "content": "Snippet from article For the year to March 2025, Canaccord Genuity forecasts an uptick in adjusted pre-tax profit from \u00a31 million to \u00a32.5 million, ahead of \u00a33.8 million in 2026, with EPS (earnings per share) building from 1.6p this year to 2.4p next year. Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

          "content": "Snippet from article For the year to March 2025, Canaccord Genuity forecasts an uptick in adjusted pre-tax profit from \u00a31 million to \u00a32.5 million, ahead of \u00a33.8 million in 2026, with EPS (earnings per share) building from 1.6p this year to 2.4p next year. Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

They sent a full replacement because they don't have spare bowls as they don't normally break. Note you are not supposed to fully immerse the bowl when cleaning IF the bowl is not fully glazed, which they tend not to be around the base.

          "content": "Snippet from article For the year to March 2025, Canaccord Genuity forecasts an uptick in adjusted pre-tax profit from \u00a31 million to \u00a32.5 million, ahead of \u00a33.8 million in 2026, with EPS (earnings per share) building from 1.6p this year to 2.4p next year. Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

They sent a full replacement because they don't have spare bowls as they don't normally break. Note you are not supposed to fully immerse the bowl when cleaning IF the bowl is not fully glazed, which they tend not to be around the base. Supposedly the base takes in water that causes it to break.",

          "content": "Snippet from article For the year to March 2025, Canaccord Genuity forecasts an uptick in adjusted pre-tax profit from \u00a31 million to \u00a32.5 million, ahead of \u00a33.8 million in 2026, with EPS (earnings per share) building from 1.6p this year to 2.4p next year. Those estimates place ProCook on an undemanding prospective PE (price to earnings) ratio of 12.1 times, which drops to single digits on the broker\u2019s 3.3p EPS estimate for full year 2027, during which ProCook may well pay a maiden dividend. Canaccord Genuity argues the current valuation \u2018does not reflect the growth opportunities from further store expansion and like-for-like initiatives\u2019. Peel Hunt believes that with ProCook in \u2018such good shape ahead of peak\u2019 the numbers can \u2018start to move north towards the \u00a3100 million sales, 10% operating margin goal in time. Any hint of that happening should see a material re-rating here: the shares are too cheap in our view.\u2019",

To back up her case, she pointed to the company's latest trading update, which revealed a near 35% jump in sales versus a year ago with same store sales up by more than half over the past two years, if the third lockdown of 2020-21, when it stores were shut, is stripped out. Online sales did fall by 7% over the 12 weeks ending on 9 January, but repeat purchases rose by 27.3% after its shift away from Amazon.com. And while workers return to offices and restaurants might drag on sales, rising energy bills and food prices could possibly encourage consumers to trade down, she said. Another potential headwind were rising shipping costs. And while the company faced competition at the lower end of the market from supermarkets and discounters its cookware was cheaper than alternatives from John Lewis and Le Creuset, a third less expensive in the case of the latter. Hence, said Meddings, the shares were a 'buy' at 140p...oh dear, how wrong can you be?",

Gross margins are high, so any top line beat would likely get things moving. Watchlist for me",
