This Fundraising will allow the Company to focus on the technical evaluation on the Ongombo and Ongeama licences in Namibia\nbefore\nproceeding to the feasibility study and if appropriate thereafter, mine construction.\nThe Ongombo project has the advantage of 300,000 tonnes of contained copper with open potential for additional resource. The project is extremely well located, some 25km from the capital city of Namibia, Windhoek and has a mining licence in place.\nIn addition, we have highly prospective copper exploration licences in Northwest Zambia, some 100km from the Ivanhoe Kamoa operating mine. These licences are situated in the Western Foreland geological architecture as well as the Fold and Thrust Belt. We intend to progress these licences in the coming dry season.\nOverall, we are very excited about the prospects of African Pioneer and look forward to unlocking the potential value we believe exists at Ongombo and making further progress at our Northwestern Zambian exploration licences. We will keep shareholders advised of our progress and results as they arise.\"\nFundraising:\nThe Company has raised \u00a31,800,000 before expenses at the Fundraising Price through the issue of 200,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nFundraising Shares\n\") conditional only upon\nadmission of the Fundraising Shares to listing on the FCA's Official List (Equity Shares (transition)) and to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAdmission\n\").

The Fundraising Price represents a discount of 10 per cent. to the closing middle market price of an Ordinary Share of 1.0 pence\non\n30 January 2026, being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement. Each participant in the Fundraising will receive one (1) warrant for each Fundraising Share issued exercisable at 1.6 pence each (the \"\nWarrant Price\n\") (the \"\nFundraising Warrants\n\"), which is at a 77.77% premium to the Fundraising Price, for two years from Admission. The issue of the Fundraising Warrants is conditional on the passing of a resolution at a General Meeting to allow their issue. The Company will shortly be issuing a notice of convening of a General Meeting. The Company is also issuing a warrant to Shard Capital Partners LLP to subscribe for a total of 2,973,750 new Ordinary Shares exercisable at the Warrant Price for a period of two years from Admission (\"\nBroker Warrants\n\"). The Broker Warrants are not subject to shareholder approval at the General Meeting.\nThe Fundraising Shares represent approximately 71.83 per cent. of the Company's current issued share capital. The Fundraising Shares will be fully paid and rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares.\nUse of Proceeds:\nThe net proceeds from the Fundraising are planned to be used in relation to the project activities with the main focus on the Ongombo and Ongemaa copper gold projects in Namibia, AFP's projects in Zambia and Botswana and general working capital requirement of the group.\nInformation on the Company's Projects\nNamibia: Ongombo and Ongeama Resource Development Update\nThe Company has completed an in-house review of the Ongombo and adjoining Ongeama copper - gold project and will now undertake a mine development drill programme to provide final geotechnical data for both open pit and underground detailed mine design together with resource drilling to confirm orebody continuity aimed at extending the open pit footprint.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nCurrent escalation in metal prices has warranted a mine design and plant throughput capacity as project economics have benefitted from substantial prices rises in all three relevant metals, copper, gold and silver.\n\u00b7\nDrilling has been proposed to facilitate detailed mine design for both the Ongombo and Ongeama projects.\nDrilling aims to increase the existing Ongombo starter pit (1.0Mt @ Cu 1.33%, Au 0.17 g/t and Ag 6.3 g/t) with further up-dip extensions to the northeast of the current pit outline\n\u00b7\nAdditional underground resources will benefit from closer spaced drilling to provide geotechnical data for development planning, confirmation of the most appropriate underground mining method and a reclassification of the Mineral Resource.\nOngombo - Ongeama Programme\nWork will be undertaken within Ongombo mining licence ML240 located within exploration licence EPL5772 and the Ongeama exploration licence, EPL6011.\nThe original JORC (2012) Mineral Resource Estimate determined a total Resource of 29 million tonnes at 1.1% CuEq ** Recent studies have also estimated a starter open pit containing 1.0Mt @ Cu 1.33%, Au 0.17 g/t and Ag 6.3 g/t\nWork planned comprises the following:\n\u00b7\nOngombo Eastern Shoot\nis open up-dip from historic drilling. The proposed drilling will aim to delineate the mineralisation extension to surface.\n\u00b7\nOngombo Ost North Shoot\nhas been under-explored. A ground magnetic geophysical survey will be undertaken following which a provisional drill programme has been recommended.\n\u00b7\nOngeama South Project\nhas defined higher grade mineralised shoots within low-grade envelopes. Two shoots have been targeted to test the up-dip extension towards surface.\nZambia:\nExternal Fold and Thrust Belt Exploration\n\u00b7\nGround Geophysics:\nAdditional geophysical surveys planned to better define drill targets within the 4 exploration licences\n\u00b7\nDrill Programme:\nTargeting near-surface mineralisation broadly defined by regional-wide geochemical surveys that highlighted extensive areas anomalous in copper.\nBotswana:\nThe Company is continuing with its review of options and strategies for these projects in consultation with an external geological consultant with specific expertise of Botswanan\u00a0copper geology. The region represents a significant copper exploration and resource development destination and as such all exploration ground has potential strategic importance particularly in the case of African Pioneer which has several licences in the general area.\nDirector & Consultant Fee Shares\n:\nIn accordance with the authority granted at its Annual General Meeting on 25 July 2025,\nto conserve working capital the Company has agreed to settle accrued fees at the Fundraising Price. \u00a3368,667 of accrued fees owed to certain Directors are being settled by the issue of a total of 40,962,960 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nConversion Shares\n\") and \u00a340,040 of accrued fees owed to consultants are being settled by the issue of 4,448,888 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nConsultant Shares\n\"). The table below shows the Directors' shareholdings after the issue of the Fundraising Shares, the Conversion Shares and the Consultant Shares.\nDirector\nCurrent shareholding\nSubscription shares\nAccrued Fees\nNumber of Conversion Shares\nNew Shareholding\n% of Enlarged TVR\nColin Bird\n24,492,284\n2,222,222\n\u00a3140,000\n15,555,555\n42,270,061\n8.1%\nRaju Samtani\n18,395,061\n2,222,222\n\u00a3116,667\n12,962,962\n33,580,245\n6.4%\nChristian Cordier\n17,222,222\n2,222,222\n\u00a370,000\n7,777,777\n27,222,221\n5.2%\nKjeld Thygesen\n1,033,334\n3,333,333\n\u00a342,000\n4,666,666\n9,033,333\n1.7%\nJames Cunningham-Davis\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTOTAL\n61,142,901\n9,999,999\n\u00a3368,667\n40,962,960\n112,105,860\n21.4%\nRelated Party Transactions - Subscription Shares and Conversion Shares\nAs Colin Bird, Raju Samtani, Christian Cordier and Kjeld Thgesen are directors of the Company, so related parties for the purposes of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (\"DTRs\"), the subscription by Directors for the Subscription Shares and the issue of Fee Conversion Shares to them constitute a 'material related party transaction' for the purposes of DTR 7.3 (the \"\nRelated Party Transactions\n\"). Accordingly, given\nthe accrued fees are being settled in ordinary shares\nto conserve working capital and the Subscription by Directors provides additional capital for the group's operations, the independent director, being James Cunningham-Davis, considers the issue of the Conversion Shares and of the Subscription Shares to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nThe Directors to which Conversion Shares and the Subscription Shares are being issued did not participate in the approval of, or vote on, such Related Party Transactions.\nApplication to trading\n: The Fundraising is conditional on Admission. Application will be made to for the 200,000,000 Fundraising Shares, 40,962,960 Conversion Shares and 4,448,888 Consultant Shares (together the\n\"New Shares\"\n)\nto\nbe listed on the FCA's Official List (Equity Shares (transition)) and admitted to trading on the main market the London Stock Exchange. It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the New Shares will commence at 8.00 a.m. on 16 February 2026.\nTotal Voting Rights\n: Following the issue of the New Shares the Company's total issued share capital will consist of 523,832,444 Ordinary Shares with voting rights. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury and accordingly there are no voting rights in respect of any treasury shares.\nOn Admission, the abovementioned figure of 523,832,444 Ordinary Shares may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, African Pioneer under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nConcert Party:\nAs disclosed at Part XVII of the Company's prospectus dated 26 May 2021 for the purposes of the City Code on Takeovers and mergers (the \"\nCity Code\n\") certain persons holding in aggregate an interest in >50 per cent. of the Company's then issued share capital\nwere deemed to be acting in concert. Over the years the interest of the Concert Party was diluted to less than 50 per cent. But more than 30 per cent.\nAs a result of this Fundraising and the issue of the Conversion Shares and the Consultant Shares and the recent sale by concert party member Tiger Alpha Plc of all their shares in the Company, on Admission the aggregated Concert Party interest in the enlarged issued share capital of the Company (as enlarged by the issue of the Fundraising Shares, Conversion Shares and the Consultant Shares) will be diluted to 26.82 per cent. Accordingly, given the aggregate Concert Party interest will be below the 30 per cent. level any future purchase by a Concert Party member that could take the interest of the Concert Party above 30 per cent. would trigger an obligation to make a mandatory takeover offer under Rule 9 of the City Code.\nIf a Concert Party member is in any doubt about the current position, it should consult the Company and seek their own financial advice from an appropriately authorised stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other independent financial adviser who, if taking advice in the United Kingdom, is duly authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\").\nAn offer under Rule 9 of the City Code must be made in cash and at the highest price paid by the person required to make the offer, or any person acting in concert with him, for any interest in shares of the Company during the 12 months prior to the announcement of the general offer.\nFor further information, please contact:\nAfrican Pioneer Plc\nColin Bird Executive Chairman\n+44 (0) 20 3416 3695\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (Financial Adviser)\nRoland Cornish\u00a0/ Asia Szusciak\n+44 (0) 20 7628 3396\nAlbR Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nShard Capital Partners LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath\n+44 (0) 20 7186 9952\nor visit https://africanpioneerplc.com/\nBeaumont Cornish Limited, which is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority, is Financial Adviser to the Company in relation to the matters referred herein.

The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.\nAn 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.\nAn 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.\n\"Au\" Gold\n\"Cu\" Copper\n\"CuEq*\" A\ncopper price of US$9,100 and a gold price of US$2,300 were used for the purposes of calculating a copper equivalent grade\n\"g/t\" grammes per tonne\n\"Kt\" thousand tonnes\n\"Mt\" million tonnes\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Ongombo has the benefit of mining and exploration permits and represents a viable near production mining potential for a 8,000 tonne of copper year project.\nThe company is investigating nearby mining concessions which have known resources and access. The company believes there is synergy between a number of projects and that Ongombo can be enlarged by collaboration or acquisition. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, Ongombo has the benefit of 300,000 tonnes of contained copper and is open ended for further additions.\nThe Zambian Northwestern copper exploration areas have had positive exploration undertaken by First Quantum our joint venture partner, and the company is in discussions with a number interested parties wishing to joint venture the exploration potential.\nThe exploration area lies some 100km from the Kamoa mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the second richest copper mine in the world and is hosted in the Western Foreland, similar geological, architectural environment. The Company has a passionate believe in copper and feel that its southern African positions will add considerable value to shareholders in the coming months.\nThe exploration projects in Botswana are currently being re-evaluated for small mining potential.\nColin Bird\nExecutive Chairman\n30 September 2025\nOPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL CORPORATE and STRATEGY REVIEWS\n1.\nOperational Review\nThe Company completed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Standard List of the London Stock Exchange and the acquisition of its projects in Zambia, Namibia, and Botswana in 2021. The primary metal in all countries is copper with by-product potential in all of our projects. In Zambia we have potential for cobalt, in Namibia for gold and in Botswana for silver. In 2022 the Company granted an option to First Quantum\nin relation to 4 of the 5 Zambian exploration licences held by African Pioneer Zambia\nwhich First Quantum has exercised more details of which are provided in the Corporate Highlights section of this review.\nThe Company's main focus during the period was on evaluating and advancing its 85% owned Namibian Projects, including the Ongombo mining licence application, and the Zambian licence (80% owned) and Botswana Projects (100% owned) that are not the subject of options.\nOn 25 June 2025 the Company announced that it had received the official, unconditional Mining Licence (ML 240) which is valid until 23 March 2045 for its 85%-owned Ongombo Copper-Gold Project, located approximately 40 km northeast of Windhoek in the Khomas Region of Namibia. The formal receipt of the physical licence marked the final step in the government permitting process and follows the award in early April 2025 of the Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC No. 2302356, dated 24 March 2025).\nKey Highlights\n\u00b7\nAll required Namibian government approvals now formally granted\n\u00b7\nMining Licence No. 240 is fully active and unconditional and is valid to 23 March 2045\n\u00b7\nCompany is engaging with external mining and resource advisors who provided updated resource estimates for the open pit mineralisation who will provide recommendations for infill drilling and colour locations that will maximise increases in the global resource\n\u00b7\nPlanning discussions are ongoing with preferred mining contractor for both open pit and underground mining. Specifically looking to build\u00a0a database\u00a0of unit\u00a0costs for key components of the mine plan to update the financial model\nThe company is investigating nearby mining concessions which have known resources and access. The company believes there is synergy between a number of projects and that Ongombo can be enlarged by collaboration or acquisition\n\u00b7\nIndependent updated total (gross)* Indicated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 5.7Mt at 1.1% Cu Equivalent (CuEq), 0.94% Cu and 0.23g/t Au and a very substantial Inferred underground potential Resources of 23Mt at 1.1% CuEq, 0.95% Cu and 0.24g/t Au as announced on 16 May 2023\n\u00b7\nAdvanced discussions with multiple parties about project level funding of the Ongombo Project.\n*gross representing 100% MRE and African Pioneer has 85% interest in the Project\n1.2. Namibia Project Background:\nThe Ongombo copper gold project is situated in Exclusive Prospecting License (EPL) 5772 in the Khomas region of the Windhoek District of Namibia, 45 km from Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. The project area has relatively well-developed infrastructure on the farms Ongombo Ost and Ongombo West. The property is easily accessed by a tar road from Windhoek to Gobabis and then on a gravel road up to the project area. There is also a railway line from Gobabis to Walvis Bay, via Windhoek running parallel to the tarred road. The Ongombo Project is located 15km northeast from Otjihase Mine which consists of two underground mines (Otjihase and Matchless) and an 800ktpa copper concentrator.\nThe Ongombo project lies within the Matchless Member of the Kuiseb Formation, a conspicuous assemblage of lenses of foliated amphibolites, chlorite-amphibolite schist, talc schist and metagabbro. This belt, up to 5km wide in the Otjihase area, stretches 350km east-north-eastwards in the Southern Zone of the Damara Orogen from the Gorob - Hope area. The deposit is generally described as a Besshi-type massive sulphide. These are described as thin sheet-like bodies of massive to well-laminated pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite within thinly laminated clastic sediments and mafic tuffs. At the Ongombo project mineralisation occurs in one continuous zone approximately 7 km long and 0.5\u00a0- 1 km wide. The mineralisation zone dips consistently 15-20\u00b0 northwest and plunges 5\u00b0 northeast. Mineralisation is gradually thinning westward.\nEPL 5772 has been renewed to 1 February 2026. A conditional Environmental Clearance Certificate for mining activities was granted on EPL 5772 and is valid until 16 April 2026. A 20 Year Mining Licence, ML 240, has been unconditionally granted until 23 March 20245 and covers a portion of EPL 5772 and approximately one third of the open pit resource. An extension to the Mining Licence was submitted on 6 September 2022 to encompass the wider Resource Area.\n1.3. Zambia Project Background:\nAs described at paragraph 3.4 below on 19 January 2022 African Pioneer Zambia Ltd, which is 80% owned by the Company, entered into an option agreement with First Quantum (listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange\nFM.TO\n) over 4 of the 5 Zambian exploration licences held by a subsidiary company, African Pioneer Zambia.\nFirst Quantum has exercised its option over the 4 Zambian licences which it has an option over.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nDrilling confirmed proof of concept that licences are in the right lithology confirming Congo-style mineralisation.\n\u00b7\n4 diamond drill holes completed at the Turaco target for 1,297.1m.\n\u00b7\nA 772.3m deep diamond drill hole completed over the Ikatu on an Audio Magneto Telluric (\"AMT\") generated target. Awaiting results.\n\u00b7\n9 reverse circulation (\"RC\") holes drilled at the Chipopa target for a total of 780m.\n\u00b7\nDuring the course of the programme First Quantum confirmed their intention to exercise their option as reported on 16 February 2024.\nFirst Quantum continue to evaluate\nt\nhe licences under the option agreement based on licence-wide geochemical analysis and drilling completed to date. A number of targets have been identified, some of which warrant more detailed follow up. This geological environment classified as the Fold and Thrust Belt is complex and the Company benefits from the expertise and local knowledge gained by First Quantum following years of exploration in the region. The Fold and Thrust Belt and adjoining Western Foreland are currently the focus of intense exploration and speculation from exploration companies of varying size and the information being generated by African Pioneer and First Quantum represents extremely valuable data and knowledge of a region with little detailed exploration having taken place but where the exploration prize is potentially significant.\n1.4. Botswana:\nThe Botswana projects comprise 5 prospecting licences which have been renewed through 31 March 2026 and comprise approximately 770 sq. km. in the Kalahari Copperbelt. Whilst the exploration to date on the licences which were the subject of the Sandfire Option Agreement does not currently indicate prospectivity for a large-scale mining operation the Board believes that there is prospectivity for a smaller to medium sized mining operation targeting in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of contained copper per annum. Although too small for a large-scale miner a mine of this size would fit very well into the demand for small to medium mines to help bridge the gap in the predicted shortfall of copper to meet future projected demand.\nAll the Botswana licences are currently under review by the Company in cooperation with its external geological consultant with specific expertise of Botswanan\u00a0copper geology. The region represents a significant copper exploration and resource development destination and as such all exploration ground has potential strategic importance particularly in the case of African Pioneer which has several licences in the general area.\n2.\nFinancial Review\n2.1 Financial highlights:\n\u00b7\n\u00a3333K loss after tax (June 2024: \u00a3322K)\n\u00b7\nApproximately \u00a369K cash at bank at the period end (Dec 2024: \u00a313K).\n\u00b7\nThe basic and diluted losses per share are summarised in the table below\nLoss per share (pence)\n2025\n2024\nBasic & diluted\nNote 3\n(0.13)p\n(0.14)p\n\u00b7\nThe net asset value as at 30 June 2025 was\n\u00a3\n4.73m (31 December 2024\n\u00a3\n4.64m)\n2.2 Fundraising and Issue of shares during the period:\nOn 10 February 2025 the Company announced it had raised \u00a3420,000 before expenses at 1 pence per Ordinary Share (\"\nFundraising Price\n\") through the issue of 42,000,000 new Ordinary Shares of no par value each (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") (the \"\nFundraising Shares\n\"). Each participant in the Fundraising also received one (1) warrant exercisable at 1.75 pence per ordinary share from 12 months to 36 months after admission on 13 February 2025 (\"\nAdmission\n\") for each Fundraising Share issued. The Company also issued a warrant to Shard Capital Partners LLP to subscribe for a total of 2,100,000 new Ordinary Shares exercisable at the Fundraising Price for a period of three years from Admission.\nOn 13 February 2025 the Company issued 207,039 new Ordinary Shares to Strategic Investments International Ltd a company controlled by PDMR Mike Allardice at 3.5 pence per share to settle \u00a37,246 of accrued fees and 1,000,000 new Ordinary Shares will be issued at the Fundraising Price to settle \u00a310,000 of accrued fees due to a consultant.\nOn 23 May 2025 the Company issued 5,970,149 Ordinary Shares at 0.67 pence to settle \u00a340,000 of accrued fees and 252,307 Ordinary Shares at 1.95 pence to settle \u00a34,920 of accrued fees.\n3.\nCorporate Review\n3.1 Company Board:\nThe Board of the Company comprises Colin Bird, Executive Chairman Raju Samtani, Finance Director Christian Cordier, Business Development Director Kjeld Thygesen, Independent Non-executive Director James Nicholas Cunningham-Davis, Non-executive Director.\n3.2 Listing:\nThe Company was admitted to the Official List (by way of Standard Listing under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules) and commenced trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange on 1 June 2021 (the \"Listing\" or \"IPO\"). On 29 July 2024, the Listing Rules were replaced by the UK Listing Rules (\"UKLR\") under which the existing Standard Listing category was replaced by the Equity Shares (transition) category under Chapter 22 of the UKLR. Consequently with effect from that date the Company is admitted to Equity Shares (transition) category of the Official List under Chapter 22 of the UKLR and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.\n3.3 Corporate Acquisitions and Group:\nAs previously reported the Company completed the acquisition of projects based in Namibia, Zambia, and Botswana and on 27 August 2021 announced that it had acquired a further 15% interest in its Namibian Projects. During the period the Company did not make any corporate acquisitions.\n3.4 First Quantum Option Agreement:\nThe First Quantum Option Agreement was announced on 20 January 2022 and the highlights of the agreement are:\n\u00b7\nThe four exploration licences the subject of the First Quantum Option Agreement are in the highly prospective Central Africa Copperbelt in northwest Zambia which is the largest and most prolific mineralized sediment- hosted copper province in the world and are located less than 100km from First Quantum's giant Sentinel copper mine.\n\u00b7\nThe exploration licenses include geological formations similar in age and rock type to that hosting the major copper deposits of the Copperbelt\n\u00b7\nOn 16 February 2024 the Company announced that First Quantum had delivered a notice to exercise their option over exploration licences 27770-HQ-LEL and 27768-HQ-LEL having already exercised in October 2023 their option over licences 27767-HQ - LEL and 27771-HQ - LEL. Prior to exercising these options First Quantum had met the initial expenditure requirement by spending US500,000 on each of the exploration licences 27767-HQ-LEL, 27768-HQ-LEL, 27770-HQ-LEL, and 27771-HQ-LEL (the \"\nZambian Projects\n\").\n\u00b7\nAlthough First Quantum has exercised its option it has at this stage it has not earned any shares in African Pioneer Zambia, just the right to proceed to the First Earn In Period.\n\u00b7\nDuring the First Earn In Period which expires on 28 February 2026, First Quantum has the right but not the obligation to prepare a Technical Report in respect of the Zambian Projects demonstrating an Indicated Mineral Resource of at least 300,000 tonnes of contained copper (the \"\nTechnical Report Requirement\n\"). First Quantum is to fund the Technical Report. Once the Technical Report is issued First Quantum has the right to be issued shares equal to a 51% shareholding in African Pioneer Zambia. This will also trigger the Second Earn-In Period.\n\u00b7\nIn the Second Earn-In Period First Quantum shall have the right but not the obligation to complete all necessary mining, metallurgical and development studies to establish a mine at the Property and make a public announcement that it intends to proceed towards commercial development of a Mine on the Property (a \"\nDecision to Mine\n\"). First Quantum is to fund all costs related to the Decision to Mine. Once First Quantum announces a Decision to Mine First Quantum has the right to be issued shares in African Pioneer Zambia to increase their 51% shareholding in African Pioneer Zambia to 75%.\nFirst Quantum:\nis one of the world's top 10 copper producers operating in several countries including Zambia where it owns the Sentinel and Kansanshi mines in North West Zambia and is known for its specialist technical engineering construction and operational skills which have allowed it to develop and successfully run complex mines and processing plants. Colin Bird, the chairman of African Pioneer, was a founder of and floated Kiwara Plc in around 2008 which discovered copper in northwest Zambia and was sold to First Quantum in January 2010 for U$260 million. First Quantum then developed the Kiwara Plc projects into the Sentinel mine which is the world's 14th largest copper mine.\nExploration licence 27769-HQ-LEL which is not covered by the Option Agreement has been transferred from African Pioneer Zambia to African Pioneer Chongwe Ltd a new Zambian company owned 80% by the Company and 20% by its local partners and is in the Zambezi area located within the Zambezi belt of southern Zambia that hosts a Lower Katanga supergroups but due to its relative lack of prospectivity compared to the Company's other licences the Company will not be undertaking further exploration work in relation to this licence.\n3.5 Sandfire Option Agreement:\nThe Sandfire Option Agreement was announced on 4 October 2021 and was for two years from 2 October 2021 and relates to PL 100/2020, PL 101/2020, PL 102/2020 and PL 103/2020 (the \"Included Licences\"). Sandfire paid US$500K and issued 107,272 Sandfire ordinary shares to the Company at the time of entering into the Sandfire Option Agreement. As announced on 29 September 2023 Sandfire notified the Company that it would not be exercising its option under the Sandfire Option Agreement. Sandfire's Exploration Commitment under the Sandfire Option Agreement was to fund US$1 million of exploration expenditure on the Included Licences (the \"Exploration Commitment\") within the Option Period with 60% of the Exploration Commitment to be on drilling and assay costs. If the Exploration Commitment is not spent, any shortfall is due to be paid by Sandfire to African Pioneer. The Company is reviewing the Exploration Commitment with Sandfire. Sandfire have confirmed that they will provide Exploration Information that it holds in relation to the Included Licences.\nAll the Botswana licences are currently under review by the Company in cooperation with its external geological consultant with specific expertise of Botswanan\u00a0copper geology. The region represents a significant copper exploration and resource development destination and as such all exploration ground has potential strategic importance particularly in the case of African Pioneer which has several licences in the general area.\nWhilst the exploration to date on the licences which were the subject of the Sandfire Option Agreement does not currently indicate prospectivity for a large-scale mining operation the Board believes that there is prospectivity for a smaller to medium sized mining operation targeting in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of contained copper per annum. Although too small for a large-scale miner a mine of this size would fit very well into the demand for small to medium mines to help bridge the gap in the predicted shortfall of copper to meet future projected demand.\n4. Strategy Review\nThe Company's short to medium term strategic objectives are to enhance the value of its mineral resource Projects through exploration and technical studies conducted by the Company or through joint venture or other arrangements (such as the Option Agreement with First Quantum on its 4 North-West Zambian licences) with a view to establishing the Projects can be economically mined for profit. With a positive global outlook for both base and precious metals, the Directors believe that the Company's Projects provide a base from which the Company will seek to add significant value through the application of structured and disciplined exploration and development of the Ongombo copper gold project in Namibia into an operating mine.\n5.\nOutlook\nOutlook for Copper:\nDuring late 2024 the copper price was around US$9,370 per tonne and in 2025 has been in the range of around US$9,000-US$10,000 and at the time of writing is just under US$10,000 per tonne. Notwithstanding this short-term volatility the forecasts for the price of copper and its by-product metals remain positive as the outlook for copper supply remains quite pessimistic as most large copper mining projects have been shelved as a result of political or economic reasons but we anticipate this will lead to both smaller but profitable mines being developed , and junior mining companies with good copper resources in reliable jurisdictions becoming potential targets for acquisitions by major mining companies. As a result, the Company is well positioned with all its projects, to take part in a potential acquisition boom or alternatively to attract financing for its own operations which might not otherwise have been available.\nThe major mining companies are seeking new projects for acquisition and all our projects have the fundamentals which may attract the attention of larger companies as reflected in the fact that First Quantum has as reported in the Corporate review section above issued an Option Exercise Notice in relation to the 4 Zambian exploration licences the subject of the First Quantum Option Agreement\nThe Board feels the Group has assembled an enviable portfolio of projects and we are pleased that Sandfire has taken and retained a significant equity position in the Company.

The principal activity of African Pioneer Plc (the 'Company') and its subsidiaries (together the 'Group') is the development\nof natural resources exploration projects in Sub-Saharan Africa\n. The Company is a public limited company and was listed on\nto the Official List (Standard Segment) and commenced trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange on 1 June 2021\n. The Company is domiciled in the Isle of Man and was incorporated on 20th July 2012 under the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 with company registration number 00859IV, and with registered address being 34 North Quay, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 4LB.\n2.\nBasis of preparation\nThe unaudited interim financial information set out above, which incorporates the financial information of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (the \"\nGroup\n\"), has been prepared using the historical cost convention and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"\nIFRS\n\").\nThese interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are unaudited and do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were audited and the auditors' report on those financial statements was unqualified and contained a material uncertainty pertaining to going concern.\nThe same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have been followed in these unaudited interim financial statements as those which were applied in the preparation of the company's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe interim consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of African Pioneer Plc and its subsidiaries.\nGoing concern basis of accounting\nThe Group made a loss from all operations for the six months ended 30 June 2025 after tax of \u00a3333K (2024: \u00a3322K), had negative cash flows from operations and is currently not generating revenues. During the period the Company raised \u00a3482,000 (gross). On 30 June 2025 Cash and cash equivalents were \u00a369K (Dec 2024: \u00a313K).\nOn 1 May 2024 the Company entered into an unsecured convertible loan funding facility agreement for up to \u00a31,000,000 (the \"\nFacility\n\"). The Facility, after adjustment (note 7) is convertible at 1.2727 pence per ordinary share. The Company has made two drawdowns of \u00a3250,000 each under the Facility and is not permitted to make any additional drawdowns. To date \u00a350,000 has been paid by the Lender under the Facility which is due to be repaid to the Lender. The Facility was created as a standby facility and the Company is re-negotiating the terms of the Facility with the Lender who is a long term shareholder in the Company.\nAn operating loss is expected in the year subsequent to the date of these accounts and as a result the Company will need to raise funding to provide additional working capital to finance its ongoing activities. Management has successfully raised money in the past, but there is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed in the future.\nBased on the Board's assessment that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, as and when required, to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements, the Board have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe management team has successfully raised funding for exploration projects in the past, but there is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed in the future.\nThere is a material uncertainty relating to the conditions above that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThis financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets amounts or liabilities that might be necessary should the entity not continue as a going concern.\n3.\nEarnings per share\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\n30\nJune\n2025\n30\nJune\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n(Loss) attributable to equity holders of the Company\n(332,639)\n(321,778)\nWeighted average number of shares\n263,854,795\n228,041,178\nWeighted average number of shares and warrants\n282,329,104\n244,891,178\nBasic loss per ordinary share\n(0.13)p\n(0.14)p\nDiluted loss per ordinary share\n(0.12)p\n(0.14)p\nThe use of the weighted average number of shares in issue in the period recognises the variations in the number of shares throughout the period and is in accordance with IAS 33 as is the fact that the diluted earnings per share should not show a more favourable position than the basic earnings per share.\n4.\nInvestments\nThe company has adopted the provisions of IFRS9 and has elected to treat all available for sale investments at fair value with changes through the profit and loss.\nAvailable-for-sale investments under IFRS9 are initially measured at fair value plus incidental acquisition costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. This is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted. All gains and losses are taken to profit and loss.\nThe Company's intention following its Listing is not to purchase any new investments and to hold its residual portfolio as realisable investments as a source of liquidity to cover explorations costs and general overheads of the Company.\n5.\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\nAcquisition of Zamcu Exploration Pty Limited (Namibian Projects)\nOn 1 June 2021 the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of\nZamcu Exploration Pty Ltd (\"\nZamcu\n\"), which via its subsidiaries, held a 70 per cent. interest in two Namibian Exclusive Prospecting Licenses (\"EPLs\") comprising the Ongombo and Ongeama projects, located within the Matchless amphibolite Belt of central Namibia that hosts copper-gold mineralization.

The Company has acquired the Namibia Projects, Zambia Projects and Botswana Projects (see Note 5 for details):\nOn 16 May 2023 the Company announced an updated Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate for the Ongombo copper project in Namibia, was completed by independent consultants Addison Mining Services (\"AMS\"). AMS has highlighted a number of areas both down-plunge and down-dip of defined mineralisation where the external consultant believes the delineation of further mineralisation is extremely likely. In addition, a large proportion of the drilling and assaying undertaken on the East-Ost Shoot did not assay for gold. Therefore, AMS also indicates that scope for a further increase in the Cu Eq grade of the East - Ost Shoot is likely once infill or twin drilling is undertaken. This is potentially significant as the East-Ost Shoot is notably thicker than the Central Shoot and offers an easier more efficient mining target than the narrower Central Shoot. Addition of gold at East - Ost Shoot may increase the global resource tonnage as the addition of further value will increase the Cu Eq grade above the 1% cu cut-off currently being used for resource estimation.\nThe Company's' main focus during the period was on evaluating and advancing its 85% owned Namibian Projects and its 100% owned Botswana Projects and the 80% owned Zambian exploration licence which is not the subject of the First Quantum Option Agreement described at paragraphs 4.5 of the Corporate Review above.\n6.2.\nExploration assets accounting policy\nExploration, evaluation and development expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest. These costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made. When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are transferred to development assets and amortised over the life of the area according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves. A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area of interest.\n7. Borrowings\nUnaudited\nAudited\n30\nJune\n2025\n31\nDecember\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nConvertible Loan Facility\n50,000\n50,000\n50,000\n50,000\nOn 1 May 2024 the Company entered into an unsecured convertible loan funding facility agreement for up to \u00a31,000,000 (the \"\nFacility\n\"). The Facility was originally convertible at 2.8 pence per ordinary share (\"\nShare\n\") but in light of the fundraising on 10 February 2025 at 1 pence per Share is now convertible at 0.1.2727 pence per Share.\nWorking Capital Facility Agreement\nThe Facility is for \u00a31,000,000 in total, is unsecured, interest free and the Company was able to be drawn down in four loan tranches of \u00a3250,000 each and the Company has made two Loan Tranche drawdowns of \u00a3250,000 each under the Facility and is not permitted to make any additional drawdowns. To date \u00a350,000 has been paid by the Lender which is due to be repaid to the Lender. The Facility was created as a standby facility and the Company is re-negotiating the terms of the Facility with the Lender who is a long term shareholder in the Company.\nRepayment and Conversion\nRepayment\nUnless otherwise converted, the Company must repay each Loan Tranche on the first anniversary of the advance by the Lender of the applicable Loan Tranche (\"\nMaturity Date\n\"). The Company may prepay the whole or part of the Facility on any day prior to the Maturity Date for a Loan Tranche upon giving not less than 14 days' prior written notice to the Lender and paying in cash a prepayment fee of 5% of the amount which the Company prepays in cash before the Maturity Date. The Lender can during the 14 days' notice period make an election for all or part of the Loan subject to a prepayment notice to be repaid in Shares in which case the 5% fee shall not apply to that proportion of the Loan repaid in Shares.\nConversion of Loan Tranche by Lender\nThe Lender may at any time during the Facility Period elect to convert all or part of any drawn down amount into such number of new Shares equal to the amount of the Loan Tranche that is to be repaid at the date of the election divided by the conversion price. The original conversion price was 2.8 pence (\"\nOriginal Conversion Price\n\") which under the conversion adjustment mechanism described below has been reduced to 1.2727 due to the fundraising at 1 pence per share announced by the Company on 10 February 2025 (\"\nFebruary 25 Fundraising\n\") (\"\nNew Conversion Price\n\").\nConversion of Loan by the Company\nThe Company may at any time during the Loan Period elect to convert all or part of a Loan if the Share price exceeds a target conversion price for a period of five or more business days. The original target conversion price was 3.6 pence per share (\n\"Original Target Conversion Price\n\") which under the conversion adjustment mechanism described below has been reduced to 1.6362 pence following the February 2025 Fundraising (\"\nNew Target Conversion Price\n\").\nConversion Adjustment Mechanism\nIf the Company before i) the Maturity Date for a Loan Tranche and before ii) the Loan Tranche has been repaid issues Shares for cash consideration (\"\nIssue Price\n\") at a discount to 2.2 pence per Share (the \"\nBase Issue Price\n\") then the Conversion Price and the Target Conversion Price in respect of that Loan Tranche shall be multiplied\nby a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Issue Price and the denominator of which will be 2.2 pence.\nInterest and Fees\nThe Loan is interest free. The Lender shall be paid an arrangement fee of 10% of the amount of the Facility to be settled by the issue of 5,089,177 new Shares (\"\nFacility Fee Shares\n\") credited as fully paid by at an issue price of 1.965p per Share (being the Five Day VWAP on the date of the announcement of the Facility) with the Facility Fee Shares to be issued on or before 31 December 2024 or such other date agreed by the parties. The Facility Fee Shares have not yet been issued.\nOn the drawdown of any Loan Tranche the Lender shall be paid a further fee of 2% of the amount of the relevant Loan Tranche which is to be settled by the issue of new Shares credited as fully paid at the five-day VWAP on the date of the relevant Loan drawdown notice (\"\nDrawdown Fee Shares\n\") with the Drawdown Fee Shares to be issued on or before 31 December 2024 or such other date agreed by the parties. The Drawdown Fee Shares have not yet been issued.\nOption to Extend Facility\nIf the Company had drawn down in full or in part against all four loan tranches then it had the option to elect to be able to drawdown up to an additional GBP500,000 (\"\nOptional Loan Tranche\n\"). As the Company only made drawdowns against two of the loan tranches it does not have this option.\nWarrants\nOn the drawdown of any Loan Tranche, the Lender shall be issued three year warrants over Shares (\"\nWarrants\n\") with a face value equal to 50% of the amount drawn down under the Loan Tranche. The exercise price for the Warrants applicable to each of the tranches are as follows:\n\u00b7\n4 pence per share for the drawdown of the four loan tranches; and\n\u00b7\n5.7 pence per share for the drawdown of the Optional Loan Tranche;\nIf there\nwere no drawdowns under two or more of the loan tranches then, the Company would be due to issue a three year warrant to the Lender for an amount equal to 25% of the Facility that has not been drawn down with an exercise price of 3.5 pence per share (\"\nNo Draw Down Warrants\n\"). The Company has not issued the No Draw Down Warrant pending the re-negotiation of the terms of the Facility with the Lender\n8.
