GPB has made a lot of progress in the first six months towards commercialisation of GasAbate, its industry-leading manure treatment system for reducing emission of methane and other noxious gases. GPB is now in contract discussions on pilot installations with two potentially significant customers and in exploratory discussions with several others. The company is also progressing discussions regarding carbon-reduction certification.\nGPRT which sits as an investment on our Balance Sheet, continues development work on its RumenGlas feed additive. Trials conducted with Teagasc (Ireland's agriculture and food development authority) have shown promising efficacy in reducing enteric methane, while at the same time improving livestock performance. GPRT is currently preparing to commence the regulatory filing and efficacy/safety trials process with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), with a view to having the product market-ready in 2028.\nThe consolidation of GPB in our interim results adds a layer of complexity to the reporting of our half-year numbers, with 100% of GPB's start-up losses taken through the income statement, with the non-owned 62.7% interest backed-out after the reported loss for the period.\nThe total loss generated by Roebuck Food Group Plc in the period amounted to \u00a31.06m. This compares with a loss of \u00a34.1m in the same period of the prior year. Within this overall loss of \u00a31.06m, Glasport Bio generated a loss of \u00a3467,000 (of which \u00a3174,000 is attributable to Roebuck Food Group plc).\nElsewhere, Moorhead & McGavin, our plant-based ingredients business experienced a challenging trading period in what was a very difficult UK food-service market, with sales down 23%, reflecting in part the elimination of some less profitable business. Contribution was down by \u00a3335,000. Gross margins declined by 1%, year on year, reflecting some price deflation while costs increased, reflecting an investment in people.\nForo Food Solutions generated a loss of \u00a354,000 for the period. This comprises a profit of \u00a37,000 from our Sourcing business based in Cork, while our new Retail business (which commenced in September 2024) generated a start-up loss of \u00a361,000. Head office costs at Roebuck Food Group reduced substantially, from \u00a3564,000 to \u00a3395,000.\nOutlook\nRegarding our plant-based ingredients and products business, we have seen a welcome improvement in trading trends in recent weeks and face less challenging like-for-like comparisons in the second half of the year.\nManagement are excited at the prospects for Roebuck Food Group plc. We have pivoted to a deep science business through the Glasport Bio and Glasport RumenTech transactions. All the information and progress to hand since completing these transactions confirms our believe that the science-underpinning these companies is robust, and the commercial opportunities are very significant.\nWe would like to compliment the GlasPort Bio and Glasport RumenTech teams on their continued success in attracting significant non-dilutive grant funding for multi-year collaborative research and demonstration projects with industry partners for their respective technologies, GasAbate and RumenGlas. Grants totalling \u20ac4.4m have been awarded by the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF, \u20ac2.9m) and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI, \u20ac1.5m).\nThe DTIF matched-funding\nFutureLives\nproject is in collaboration with Agri IoT and University of Galway, with a goal\nto enhance\u00a0nutrient efficiency\u00a0and significantly\u00a0reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a more climate-resilient agricultural sector. The SEAI\nGasAbate Select\nproject is in conjunction\nwith Ashleigh Farms and\nwill demonstrate how GasAbate treatment can transform animal manures into efficient, cost-effective feedstocks for green-energy production by medium-scale AD plants.\nThe grant awards, which may be worth up to \u20ac2.4m in aggregate between GlasPort Bio and Glasport RumenTech, represent a further vote of confidence in these technologies regarding their potential for recycling nutrients and energy from livestock farming and decarbonisation of food production.\nDividend\nThe board does not recommend the payment of a dividend.\nRoebuck Food Group Plc\nConsolidated income statement\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025\nSix months\nSix months\nended\nended\n30 June\n30 June\n2025\n2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Restated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContinuing operations\nRevenue\n5,369\n5,966\nCost of sales\n(4,461)\n(4,990)\nGross profit\n908\n976\nAdministrative expenses\n(1,656)\n(1,232)\nImpairment of Intangible assets\n(271)\n(30)\nAcquisition and related costs\n(94)\n(35)\nOperating loss\n(1,113)\n(321)\nFinance income -

In the latter regard, we lost our longtime and esteemed Chairman, the late Ted O'Neill, in November 2024. For two decades, Ted provided entrepreneurial leadership as Executive Chairman, culminating in the monetisation of the Cold Stores Division and return of capital to shareholders. Following payment of this significant dividend, Ted stepped back to the Non-executive Chairman role, while guiding the management team as they set about defining a new corporate strategy for the business. With this strategic reset now completed, I am honoured and excited to take on the role of Non-executive Chairman as we approach the 40th anniversary of Roebuck's listing the stock market (originally as Norish plc) and embark on a new chapter for the business.\nThe strategic reset involved identification of investment themes where our team has practical operational experience, applied-science know-how, and strong business ecosystem understanding and networks. Technologies and business models that support sustainable agriculture and food supply were identified as investment areas meeting these criteria. Roebuck believes that climate-smart agriculture and resilient food supply-chains will present major investment opportunities over the next decade. Furthermore, with 2024 global venture capital investment in agrifoodtech down over 70% from its 2021 peak and 30% below its ten-year average, Roebuck considers that high quality targets are now available at attractive valuations.\nAcquisitions and Disposals\nDuring 2023 and 2024, Roebuck examined 25 investment targets, conducted due diligence on 9 of these, and proceeded to invest in three companies, namely Moorhead & McGavin (sustainable plant-based ingredient sourcing), GlasPort Bio (animal manure-treatment that reduces methane and other harmful gaseous emissions and preserves valuable recycled plant nutrients and renewable energy) and Glasport Rumen Tech (developing a novel animal feed-ingredient that both reduces methane emissions and enhances livestock performance).\nThe acquisition of Moorhead & McGavin was completed in November 2023, while the GlasPort Bio and Glasport Rumen Tech transactions were announced in December 2024 and completed in February 2025. We are very pleased to have had the leading agrifoodtech investment fund, Yield Lab Europe, join us as a co-investor in GlasPort Bio and Glasport Rumen Tech. We are also pleased to report that since announcing the transactions in February, the management teams have had extensive engagement with policy makers and large food processors in Ireland and internationally.\nRoebuck's strategic reset also involved the disposal of legacy businesses that did not fit with the new refined investment criteria set out above. The Company disposed of Cantwellscourt Farm and Townview Foods in May and September 2024 respectively. The costs incurred in acquisition target due diligence, acquisition / disposal processes, and equity issuance were significant, but represent, in the Board's opinion, necessary investment to put in place a platform that will deliver significant growth in shareholders' equity value in the years ahead.\nRoebuck now comprises two areas of focus: first, world-class patent-protected and patent-pending technologies respectively for animal-manure treatment and animal-nutrition treatment with significant global market potential, and second, global sourcing and supply-chain management of plant-based ingredients and products for the manufacturing and food-service sectors in the UK and Ireland.\nOur Stakeholders\nOn behalf of the Board, I want to welcome our new colleagues and co-investors in GlasPort Bio and Glasport RumenTech, and to thank our management and staff in our plant-based business. I want particularly to thank Justin McCarthy for his important input into reshaping the new company strategy and to convey our best wishes to him in his new role as CEO of GlasPort Bio and Executive Chairman of Glasport Rumen Tech. Finally, I want to thank you, our shareholders, whether you are longstanding\ninvestors or new\ninvestors in our recent placing, for your support and confidence in the vision that we have set for Roebuck.\nDividend\nThe Board does not recommend payment of a dividend in respect of Financial Year 2024.\nTommy Conway\nNon-Executive Chairman\nChief Executives Officer's Review\nRoebuck Food Group plc (AIM: RFG; \"Roebuck\" or the \"Group\"), is pleased to announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nDuring the year under review, management at Roebuck completed a fundamental strategic review of the business. Arising from this strategic review, the divestment of two subsidiaries (Townview Foods Ltd and Cantwellscourt Farm Ltd) was completed.\nThese divestments have simplified our business, allowed us to reduce group overhead and ultimately created the space and time to complete the GlasPort Bio and Glasport Rumen Tech transactions. Costs relating to these transactions, in addition to other due diligence costs, amounted to Stg\u00a31.12m.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe results for the twelve months to end December 2024 reflect these divestments in significant part, as follows; Discontinued items account for \u00a33.6m of the \u00a35.4m loss. The remainder comprises the aforementioned acquisition costs of \u00a31.12m, and Group overhead costs, offset by profits from M&M and Foro.\nThe divestment of Townview Foods has resulted in a goodwill write-off of circa \u00a32.3m, in addition to trading losses of \u00a30.7m, reflecting \u00a30.2m of proceeds for the business and \u00a30.9m of trading losses (these trading losses included an investment in people, as articulated in the 2023 Annual Report, who continue to work with us elsewhere in our operations today).\nThe loss at Cantwellscourt Farm comprises a write down on the asset of \u00a30.4m, professional fees of \u00a30.1m, together with seasonal trading losses of \u00a30.1m, which reflects the time of the year when the divestment was made (grass-based dairy farming in Ireland is loss-making in the early months of the year).\nNet debt stood at \u00a30.5m at end December 2024.\nContinuing Operations\nMoorhead & McGavin, the company which we acquired in November 2023, and which is focused on plant-based ingredients performed strongly in 2024. M&M generated pretax profits of \u00a30.3m in 2024.\nForo Food Solutions, our Cork based sourcing business comprises two parts; the sourcing of plant-based ingredients and products primarily for the Food Service and Food Manufacturing segments of the market and a newer activity, which engages primarily with Retail. Our Cork based business was profitable for the first time last year, with strong growth exhibited, albeit from a small base. Overall, our continuing businesses were profitable in 2024 and generated good cashflow.\nPost Balance Sheet events; Acquisitions and Equity Raise\nThe Group announced in December 2024 the conditional acquisition of a controlling stake in GlasPort Bio and a minority investment in Glasport RumenTech. These transactions were completed on 7 February 2025. Roebuck now owns 37.3% of GlasPort Bio (with a Call Option to increase its holding to 82.3%. exercisable during the period from 18 months to 48 months post completion) and 16% of Glasport Rumen Tech. These transactions represent a fundamental step change for Roebuck and create a platform with strong IP and potential opportunities of international significance. The Board believes that the Group can leverage this platform to credibly become a global leader in methane reduction technologies in the dairy and meat supply chain.\nIn conjunction with these transactions, the Group completed in January 2025 an oversubscribed equity raise of \u00a38.2m gross of costs, the proceeds of which were used to fund the transactions and associated costs, and for general corporate purposes.\nOutlook\nGlasPort Bio: Following the closing of the transaction on 7 February, the company's management team have been actively engaged with relevant stakeholders across the Irish and international meat and dairy industries. The management team have been encouraged by the positive reaction to GasAbate's strong scientific underpinning that demonstrates multiple co-benefits in addition to best-in-class methane emission reduction from stored animal manure. Discussions are at an early stage with a number of parties, regarding commercial roll-out of the GasAbate system, and these will be progressed through the course of the year. Enterprise development in 2025 will also focus on scaling GlasPort Bio's supply chain, installation and CRM capabilities, as well as delivering a robust measurement, recording and verification (MRV) system.\nGlasport Rumen Tech: Headline results from a large-scale trial in commercial beef production are expected to be released during the first half of 2025. This trial, which was conducted by an independent agency, will report on RumenTech's efficacy in lowering methane emissions from feedlot animals, along with its impact (if any) on the animals' feed conversion efficiency and liveweight gain. The results of this trial will inform the company's approach to conducting further trials according to the protocols required by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as part of its zootechnical feed additive regulatory approval process.\nPlant-based ingredients and products: Notwithstanding more challenging markets for M&M in early 2025, we are confident that the investment we have made during 2024 and other actions we are taking will see improved trading over the balance of the year. Trading to date at Foro Food Solutions in Cork is similar to 2024, but we expect to see accelerated profit delivery over the next number of months. Foro Retail is loss making, reflecting the fact that it is a start up.

In this capacity he recently advised Roebuck in relation to its acquisition of interests in GlasPort Bio Limited (\"\nGlasPort Bio\n\") and GlasPort Rumen Tech Limited (\"\nGlasPort Rumen Tech\n\"), and ancillary agreements. As announced on 7 February 2025, Mr Conway has been nominated by Roebuck to the Boards of GlasPort Bio and GlasPort Rumen Tech as non-executive director of those companies.\nMr Conway is a graduate in Agricultural Science from University College Dublin, holds an MSc in Climate Change from Dublin City University, and a Graduate Diploma in Sustainable Leadership from University College Dublin. A former business editor of the Irish Farmers Journal, he was for 11 years subsequently an equity analyst and institutional equity sales director with Davy Stockbrokers, then becoming a Director and Head of Institutional Equities at NCB Group for 12 years, followed by 10 years as a Director with Investec Corporate Finance. Mr Conway has extensive experience advising public and private companies, and leading successful sell-side and buy-side transactions in the UK and Irish agrifood sector, including the sale in 2021 by Roebuck (then Norish plc) of its Cold Stores division.\nThe\u00a0following\u00a0information in respect of Tommy Conway is\u00a0disclosed\u00a0pursuant\u00a0to\u00a0Rule\u00a017\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0AIM\u00a0Rules\u00a0for\u00a0Companies:\nCurrent Directorships and Directorships held in the last 5 years:\nTCCA Limited\nSkelgrove ltd (Resigned December 2022)\nSave as set out above, there is no additional information under Schedule 2, paragraph (g) of the AIM Rules for Companies which needs to be disclosed.\nCommenting on the appointment of Mr Conway, Roebuck Chief Executive Kieran Mahon stated:\n\"Last year we lost our long-standing Chairman, the late Ted O'Neill, who oversaw both the 2021 transaction which returned \u00a350 million to shareholders and the steady refocussing of the Group's activities after that to what they are today. We are delighted that Tommy Conway is now undertaking the role of Chairman to lead the next exciting chapter for our company. Tommy's agricultural science and climate qualifications, and his experience in plc and private company advisory and M&A will be great assets as we drive forward our strategic mission to deliver stakeholder value creation across innovation, efficiency and sustainability in agriculture and food production.\"\nThe directors of the Company accept responsibility for this announcement.\nEnquiries:\nRoebuck Food Group plc\nAidan Hughes, Deputy Chairman Telephone: + 44 1293 862 498\nJ & E Davy (Nomad)\nAnthony Farrell Telephone: + 353 1 679 6363\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
