The Company follows a balanced strategy of advancing and strengthening its asset portfolio through targeted technical work and project development, while evaluating partnerships, joint ventures, and selective monetisation opportunities that are value-enhancing for shareholders. At the same time, Alien will continue to consider opportunities to expand our asset base through carefully selected acquisition opportunities which meet the Board's prudent criteria.\nAlien's principal focus is the advancement and development of its 90%-owned Hancock Iron Ore Project in the central Pilbara region of Western Australia. The Hancock tenements contain a JORC-compliant resource of 8.4Mt at 60% Fe and offer significant exploration upside,\nwhich is targeted to deliver a mining operation of 2Mtpa for 10 years\n. The Project benefits from direct access to the Great Northern Highway, providing a route to export facilities at Port Hedland, one of the world's largest iron ore export hubs. Alien also holds exploration interests in the Brockman and Vivash iron ore projects in the West Pilbara.\nAlien additionally retains exposure to two advanced precious and base metal assets in the Pilbara. At Munni Munni, one of Australia's largest PGM systems hosting a historic resource of 2.2Moz PGM (Palladium, Platinum, and Rhodium) and gold, the Company has entered into a conditional joint venture with GreenTech Metals Ltd, under which Alien will retain a 30% interest, free carried to the completion of a bankable feasibility study. Alien also retains a 30% interest in the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project through a joint venture with West Coast Silver Limited, which encompasses Elizabeth Hill Mining Lease and exploration tenements surrounding the historical silver mine, which has produced some of Australia's highest-grade silver ore during the late 1990s.\nAppendix A - ASX: WCE ANNOUNCEMENT\n$3.2m Placement to Fund 2026 Exploration at Elizabeth Hill\nHighlights\n\u00b7\n$3.2 million in firm commitments received via a strategic placement to institutional and professional investors, led by CPS Capital.\n\u00b7\nProceeds to advance drilling, assay processing and follow-up exploration at the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project, together with regional target evaluation.\n\u00b7\nExploration focused on identifying additional Elizabeth Hill-style silver mineralisation and assessing the potential for repeat deposits within the broader district.\n\u00b7\nAssay results expected early in the New Year, providing near-term newsflow.\n\u00b7\nTechnical site visits planned in January/early February 2026, including engagement with specialist geologists to refine 2026 exploration priorities.\nExecutive Chairman Bruce Garlick said:\n\"Strong support from existing and new investors puts West Coast Silver in a well-funded position heading into 2026. Against a supportive silver price backdrop, we're focused on advancing Elizabeth Hill and accelerating target generation across the broader district, with assays expected early in the New Year and technical site visits planned in January/early February.\"\nWest Coast Silver Limited (ASX: WCE) (West Coast Silver or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has received firm commitments to raise $3.2 million (before costs) via a placement of fully paid ordinary shares (Placement) to existing and new institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\nThe Placement provides additional funding to maintain exploration momentum at Elizabeth Hill and progress regional target evaluation across the Company's consolidated project area.\nUse of Funds\nFunds raised will be applied to:\n\u2022 Ongoing drilling and follow-up exploration at the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project\n\u2022 Assay processing and interpretation, with results expected early in the New Year\n\u2022 Evaluation of near-mine and regional targets aimed at identifying additional Elizabeth Hill-style silver mineralisation and the potential for repeat deposits within the district\n\u2022 Technical site visits planned for January/February 2026, including engagement with specialist and expert geologists to refine 2026 exploration priorities\n\u2022 General working capital to support an expanded exploration program\nThe successful capital raising places West Coast Silver in a strong financial position heading into 2026, with multiple exploration and news-flow catalysts anticipated.\nPlacement\nThe Placement comprises the issue of 16,842,106 fully paid ordinary shares at an issue price of $0.19 per share (New Shares). The Placement is within the Company's placement capacity under ASX Listing Rule 7.1.\nThe Placement issue price represents a 11.9% discount to the Company's fifteen (15) day volume weighted average price (VWAP) 0.2157. The Placement is expected to close on 5 January 2026, with New Shares to be issued on or around 7 January 2026, subject to receipt of funds and completion of standard settlement procedures.\nThe Placement was led by CPS Capital Group Pty Ltd as Lead Manager, for which it will receive standard capital raising fees and broker options, subject to shareholder approval where required.\nNext Steps\nWith exploration activity underway and assays pending, West Coast Silver is positioned to carry momentum into 2026. Assay results are expected early in the New Year, and technical site visits are planned for January/early February to support target refinement and program planning.\nThe Elizabeth Hill Project\nElizabeth Hill is historically one of Australia's highest grade silver projects and has a proven production history outlined below:\n\u2022\nHigh grades enabled low processing tonnes: 1.2Moz of silver was produced from just 16,830t of ore at a head grade of 2,194g/t (70.5 oz/t Ag)\n[1]\n.\n\u2022\nPrevious mining operation ceased in 2000: because of low silver prices (US$5)\n[2]\n.\n\u2022\nSimplistic historical processing technique: native silver was recovered via low-cost gravity separation techniques.\n\u2022\nUntapped potential remains in ground with deposit open at depth and recent consolidation of land package offers potential to discover more Elizabeth Hill style deposits.\nTier 1 Mining Jurisdiction located on a mining lease with potential processing option at the nearby Radio Hill site. Radio Hill is a third-party-owned processing facility; WCE has no current agreement in place.\"\nFigure 3: Tenement Location.\nThrough the consolidation of the surrounding land packages into a single contiguous 180km2 package significant exploration and growth potential exists both near mine and regionally. The land package holds a significant portion of the Munni Munni fault system, and other fault systems subparallel to the Munni Munni fault system, which are considered prospective for Elizabeth Hill look-a-like silver deposits.\nThis ASX announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Directors of West Coast Silver Limited.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBruce Garlick\nExecutive Director\nWest Coast Silver Limited\nE:\ninfo@westcoastsilver.com.au\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to Exploration Results is based on information reviewed by Mr Max Nind who is a Member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists.

    "bottom_line": "Speculative neutral stance: the company has a potentially exciting drilling story but the current lack of traction, zero price, and no social proof make it a high\u2011risk play.
