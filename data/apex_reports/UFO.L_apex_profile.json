This resource was historically defined in the period 1985-2002 with 91,077m of drilling comprising 328 drill holes.\n\u00b7\nCautionary Statement\n[2]\n- The estimates are historical and are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012); a competent person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as mineral resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code (2012); and it is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work that the historical estimates will be able to be reported as mineral resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).\n\u00b7\nPhase 1 drilling program has recommenced at the Munni Project, following the festive season break, aimed at enabling the Company to restate the historic MRE in accordance with JORC (2012) in early 2026.\n\u00b7\nStrengthening PGE and copper prices combined with the consolidation of the nearby Whundo copper project has potential to enhance project economics and provide a clear catalyst to reevaluate Munni Munni's established PGE-Cu-Ni endowment.\nGreenTech Metals Ltd (ASX: GRE) (GreenTech or the Company)\nis pleased to announce results of the General Meeting held today where shareholders approved the transformational acquisition of the Munni Munni Platinum-Palladium-Copper-Nickel Project located adjacent to the Company's advanced Whundo Copper-Zinc-Gold Project. The consolidation of these projects creates potential for an emerging district-scale multi-commodity development hub in the West Pilbara region of Western Australia.\nResults of the General Meeting are detailed below.\nFollowing shareholder approval, the Company is now progressing the relevant remaining administrative steps to complete the transaction. Concurrently, phase 1 drilling recommenced following the festive season break, to provide QA/QC verification of the historic modelled resource sufficient to enable a classification of the MRE to JORC (2012) standard in early 2026.\nNon-Executive Chairman, Simon Kidston, commented:\n\"\nThe overwhelming support from shareholders underscores the strategic importance of Munni Munni to GreenTech's growth strategy. This transformational acquisition delivers scale, quality and immediate development momentum at a time of strengthening PGE and copper markets\n.\"\nThis announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of GreenTech Metals Limited.\nFor further information, please contact:\nThomas Reddicliffe\nExecutive Director\nGreenTech Metals Limited\nE:\ninfo@greentechmetals.com.au\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe information in this report that relates to Exploration Targets, Exploration Results, Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves is based on information compiled or reviewed by Mr Thomas Reddicliffe a Competent Person who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Earlier development stalled mainly due to weaker PGE prices at the time.\n\u2022\nConventional processing pathway: Historical studies indicate the mineralisation responds well to traditional flotation and concentration techniques.\n\u2022\nSignificant growth potential: Mineralisation remains open along strike and at depth, with modern geophysics and drilling across the now-consolidated tenure expected to unlock additional high-grade zones.\n\u2022\nTier-1 mining jurisdiction: Located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on a granted mining lease, with proximity to the Radio Hill processing facility (third-party owned; GRE has no current agreement in place\nThe consolidation of the surrounding land into a single 346.4km\u00b2 contiguous package provides a strategic opportunity for district-scale exploration. The package covers a substantial portion of the Munni Munni intrusion and associated fault systems, which are prospective for both expansion of the known PGE-Cu-Ni Reef and the discovery of additional PGE sulphide targets along parallel structural corridors.\nMunni Munni Project Tenement Location\n[1]\nRefer ASX Announcement Helix Resources Limited (ASX: HLX) \"First Quarter Activities and Cashflow Report (Part B)\", dated 31 October 2002\n[2]\nRefer GRE:ASX Announcement \"Acquisition of High Grade Munni Munni Project - Amendment\" 11 December 2025\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company follows a balanced strategy of advancing and strengthening its asset portfolio through targeted technical work and project development, while evaluating partnerships, joint ventures, and selective monetisation opportunities that are value-enhancing for shareholders. At the same time, Alien will continue to consider opportunities to expand our asset base through carefully selected acquisition opportunities which meet the Board's prudent criteria.\nAlien's principal focus is the advancement and development of its 90%-owned Hancock Iron Ore Project in the central Pilbara region of Western Australia. The Hancock tenements contain a JORC-compliant resource of 8.4Mt at 60% Fe and offer significant exploration upside, which is targeted to deliver a mining operation of 2Mtpa for 10 years. The Project benefits from direct access to the Great Northern Highway, providing a route to export facilities at Port Hedland, one of the world's largest iron ore export hubs. Alien also holds exploration interests in the Brockman and Vivash iron ore projects in the West Pilbara.\nAlien additionally retains exposure to two advanced precious and base metal assets in the Pilbara. At Munni Munni, one of Australia's largest PGM systems hosting a historic resource of 2.2Moz PGM (Palladium, Platinum, and Rhodium) and gold, the Company has entered into a conditional joint venture with GreenTech Metals Ltd, under which Alien will retain a 30% interest, free carried to the completion of a bankable feasibility study. Alien also retains a 30% interest in the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project through a joint venture with West Coast Silver Limited, which encompasses Elizabeth Hill Mining Lease and exploration tenements surrounding the historical silver mine, which has produced some of Australia's highest-grade silver ore during the late 1990s\n.\nAppendix A - ASX: GRE ANNOUNCEMENT\nDrill Programme Recommences at Munni Munni PGE-Cu-Ni Project, WA\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nPhase 1 drilling programme has recommenced at the Munni Munni Platinum-Palladium-Copper-Nickel Project in WA, following the festive season break.\n\u00b7\nThe Munni Munni Project is situated on granted Mining Leases (MLs) with a historical JORC (2004) Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 24 Mt @ 2.9 g/t 4E (PGE + Au) for 2.2Moz (HLX, 2002)\n[1]\n. This resource was historically defined in the period 1985-2002 with 91,077m of drilling comprising 328 drill holes.\n\u00b7\nCautionary Statement\n[2]\n- The estimates are historical and are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012); a competent person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as mineral resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code (2012); and it is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work that the historical estimates will be able to be reported as mineral resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).\n\u00b7\nThe planned Phase 1 drill programme comprises up to 20 holes for approximately 6,000m to provide QA/QC verification of historic resources to enable the Company to restate the MRE in accordance with JORC (2012) in early 2026, potentially expand the resource outside of the existing mineralised envelope and obtain material for metallurgical testwork.\n\u00b7\nThe diamond coring portion of the programme commenced in late December 2025 with 8 drill holes to be completed for ~2,000m.\n\u00b7\nA second drill rig will commence the RC portion of the drill programme (~4,000m) in the coming days.\n\u00b7\nThere is excellent preservation of the stored historical core along with related laboratory sample pulps, which can potentially be used to accelerate the QA/QC validation of the historical resource.\n\u00b7\nStrengthening PGE and copper prices, combined with the consolidation of the nearby Whundo copper project, has the potential to enhance project economics and provide a clear catalyst to re-evaluate Munni Munni's established PGE-Cu-Ni endowment.\nGreenTech Metals Ltd (ASX: GRE) (GreenTech or the Company)\nis pleased to announce that, following the festive season break, the Phase 1 drill programme has recommenced at the Munni Munni Platinum-Palladium-Copper-Nickel Project located adjacent to the Company's advanced Whundo Copper-Zinc-Gold Project. The consolidation of these projects creates potential for an emerging district-scale multi-commodity development hub in the West Pilbara region of Western Australia.\nDrilling, which had commenced in December, was paused for the festive season on 20 December with 162m completed on the first drill hole.\nThe finalisation of the acquisition of a 70% interest1 in this project, with provision to go to 80% is subject to shareholder approval on 21 January 2026.\nNon-Executive Chairman, Simon Kidston, commented:\n\"We are very pleased that our Phase 1 drill programme at Munni Munni has quickly recommenced and with a second drill rig engaged to accelerate the programme. This is a defining programme for GreenTech with the key objective of unlocking the full potential of this world-class PGE-Cu-Ni project.\n\"With strong global demand for PGEs, improving metal prices and district-scale consolidation achieved (subject to shareholder approval in January 2026), this programme is designed to transition Munni Munni into a modern, JORC (2012) resource and position the Company for the next phase of technical and commercial evaluation to create value for our shareholders.\"\nPhoto\n1\n:\nDiamond Drilling at Munni Munni PGE-Cu-Ni Project\nPhase 1 Drill Programme:\nThe Phase 1 drill programme of up to 20 drill holes will comprise a combination of Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond Drill (DD) holes for approximately 6,000m to provide QA/QC verification of the historic modelled resource sufficient to enable a classification of the MRE to JORC (2012) standard in early 2026.\nTo the extent possible within the programme constraints, the drilling will include infill and step-out coverage across the Ferguson Reef (\nError! Reference source not found.\n), targeting both the historically defined higher-grade core within the 2002 MRE\n[3]\n, extensions along strike and assessing the potential for additional shallow copper-nickel outside the current resource footprint. Intervals of the diamond cored mineralisation will be selected for detailed geological, mineralogical and structural analysis. In addition, representative composite samples will be selected and prepared for metallurgical testwork.\nDue to the rugged terrain, small footprint track-mounted drill rigs have been chosen to undertake both the core and RC drilling components of the drill programme. The drill programme is anticipated to be completed in February 2026, with assay results anticipated approximately 4-6 weeks after completion.\nFigure\n1\n: Phase 1 Planned Drill Programme at Ferguson Reef\nThe Munni Munni Project is situated on granted Mining Leases (MLs) with a historical JORC (2004) Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 24 Mt @ 2.9 g/t 4E (PGE + Au) for 2.2Moz (HLX, 2002)\n[4]\n.
