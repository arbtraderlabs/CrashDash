Application has been made to admit the New Shares to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). Admission is expected to become effective on 9 April 2024 and the New Shares will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares in issues.\nShare Buyback and Cancellation\nImmediately following Admission, the Company will utilise the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 31 May 2023 to purchase the 70,000 New Shares and 50,000 existing shares held by an employee, and cancel them (the \"Share Buyback and Cancellation\"). RTC will pay a cash consideration of 95p per share, being the closing price on 2 April 2024, the last business day prior to this announcement.\nThe Share Buyback will be funded from the Company's cash resources and bank facilities.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe participation of Sarah Dye in the Share Buyback and Cancellation is a related party transaction for the purposes of the AIM Rules.\nThe Independent Director, being Andy Pendlebury (CEO and Chairman), believes that the share buyback provides a cost-effective way of providing remuneration due to the Group Finance Director.\nThe Independent Director therefore considers, having consulted with Spark Advisory Partners, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the Share Buyback and Cancellation are fair and reasonable in so far as Shareholders are concerned.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing the Option Exercise, Share Buyback and Cancellation, the Company's total shares in issue and total voting rights will reduce by the 50,000 Existing Shares being cancelled.

This coupled with our financial competence and effective corporate governance will form the foundation for continued growth and shareholder value which remains the key priority of the Group.\nFinally, I know everybody in the organisation would have liked to have our founder and longstanding Chairman, Bill Douie, alongside us as we celebrate our best ever results. Bill would not have wanted his passing to overshadow the success that the people in the Group have achieved, it just wasn't his way. However, it cannot and should not go without saying that Bill was instrumental in setting the culture of the Group and was encouraging of everything we did and everybody who did it. There would be no one prouder of what we have achieved together in 2023.\nIn memory of our colleague and friend Bill Douie.\n\"\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1842\nAndy Pendlebury, Chairman and Chief Executive\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / Mark Brady\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nSI Capital (Broker)\nNick Emerson\nSam Lomanto\nwww.sicapital.co.uk\nTel: 0148 341 3500\nAbout RTCGroup at a glance\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed recruitment business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers, in both domestic and international markets, through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting the best technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of UK customers.

In addition, there was significant disruption due to industrial action across the whole rail network. I am pleased to report that, whilst industrial action remains disappointingly prevalent, albeit with less impact, our Rail business is back trading strongly and in line with our expectations. Our other businesses are also showing strong recovery and have progressed well as anticipated.\nI am therefore pleased to be able to report that the Group has enjoyed a buoyant first half and that we have posted a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.0m for the period.\nWhilst I have been reluctant in recent years, especially given such turbulent times for the global economy, to propose the payment of dividends, given these excellent results, which represent our best-ever first half, I am proposing to make a cautious return to payment of dividends with an interim dividend of 1p per share.\nOutlookWe remain cautiously confident that our progress will continue in the second half of 2023. We continue to invest in our businesses and to further strengthen our balance sheet through retained profits.\"\nThe interim report is available on the Company's website\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\n.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1835\nBill Douie, Chairman\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / James Keeshan\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nSI Capital (Broker)\nNick Emerson / Sam Lomanto\nwww.sicapital.co.uk\nTel:\n0148 341 3500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of clients.

Total dividend in respect of the year to 31 December 2022: Nil (2021: Nil).\nCommenting on the results Andy Pendlebury, CEO said:\n\"\n2022 was a year of two very contrasting halves for RTC Group. Like many other companies, the early part of the year continued to be impacted by the effects of covid. Additionally, the new maintenance and renewals contract with Network Rail which saw Ganymede Rail successfully awarded another long-term programme of work, was heavily biased towards upfront cost and investment activities. Whilst the combined effect of these two events impacted our first half profitability, the fundamental capabilities underpinning all our trading entities remained robust. The second half of the year saw much improved trading across the Group. With the exception of Ganymede Rail, all of our businesses enjoyed second half run rates last seen prior to the onset of covid in 2020.\nOur overall financial position sees the Group with no long-term debt, a working capital facility with significant headroom for growth, and strong cash and treasury management supporting predominately blue chip and government backed clients. RTC Group has a strong balance sheet which hasn't necessitated any form of recapitalisation which befell many larger players in the sector and a very strong and lengthy order book with many leading clients across a number of our sectors. I believe we are well positioned to capitalise on growth opportunities as they emerge.\"\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1842\nBill Douie, Chairman\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / Mark Brady\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nPanmure Gordon (Broker)\nHugh Rich\nwww.panmure.com\nTel: 020 7886 2500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed recruitment business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting the best technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of UK and international clients.

At this time, no interim dividend is proposed for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: Nil).\nCommenting on the results, Bill Douie, Chairman, said:\n\"The first half of 2022 has been a difficult trading period. Several of our trading areas have responded well to opportunities arising from the transition from onerous pandemic conditions to an acceptance that we are able to live with continuing COVID outbreaks, bringing nearer to normal business conditions. In addition, the change of routes awarded in our new long-term Network Rail contract has brought a number of short-term but significant challenges and costs resulting in a reduced contribution from that element of our Group.\nHowever, despite this and other headwinds bringing a deteriorating global economic situation following the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, our UK, international and energy recruitment businesses all showed improving signs of growth and The Derby Conference Centre has increased its profitability.\nThis has resulted in a small positive EBITDA but a Group pre-tax loss for the first half.\nAlthough the second half of the year will be affected by the emergence of 'definitely not transitory' higher levels of inflation and increasing interest rates, we are expecting all areas of our business that are currently performing well to continue to do so and the rail business situation to stabilise enabling a return to a more positive trading outcome for that period.\n\"\nThe interim report is available on the Company's website\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\n.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1835\nBill Douie, Chairman\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / James Keeshan\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nPanmure Gordon (Broker)\nHugh Rich\nwww.panmure\n.\ncom\nTel: 020 7886 2500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of clients.

The Group has no term debt.\n\u00b7\nEarnings per share (basic) 0.04p (2020: 4.66p).\n\u00b7\nNo final dividend is proposed. Total dividend in respect of the year to 31 December 2021: Nil (2020: Nil).\nCommenting on the results Andy Pendlebury, CEO said:\n\"RTC Group, like many other companies, had an extremely challenging year in 2021. The COVID pandemic continued to significantly impact client demand across many markets and where requirements for contract labour remained strong this was accompanied by higher operational costs to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our workforce; candidate reluctance to change employers/careers given these turbulent times and workers self-isolating increased both direct and indirect costs as programme and project continuity was heavily disrupted. In addition, the sudden and immediate demobilisation from Afghanistan due to the complete withdrawal in August of all American, United Kingdom and NATO troops curtailed a large contribution of revenue from our international business. Further, the implementation of changes to IR 35 in the private sector, which finally became legislation in April 2021, heavily impacted our white-collar contracting community.\nHowever, despite the untimely combination and cumulative effect of all these events, the majority of which were outside of the control of the Group, we still managed to trade, albeit marginally, in positive territory. Our balance sheet remains robust and free from long term debt or the effects of dilution, a fate which befell many shareholders of other traded recruitment businesses over the past couple of years, who raised equity at sub-optimal values in order to survive, and through the Board's successful share option cancellation programme.\nAlthough for many reasons we are all naturally very disappointed with the way the year played out for us, and also mindful of the fact that there are still many geo-political events and micro-economic challenges threatening the domestic and international landscape, we believe our positioning across a broad range of markets, sectors and industries, give us every reason to be optimistic about our ability to deliver long term sustainable value to all our stakeholders.\"\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1842\nBill Douie, Chairman\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / Mark Brady\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nPanmure Gordon (Broker)\nHugh Rich\nwww.panmure.com\nTel: 020 7886 2500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed recruitment business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting the best technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of UK and international clients.

At this time, no interim dividend is proposed for the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020: Nil).\nCommenting on the results, Bill Douie, Chairman, said:\n\"\nThe first half of 2021 has been navigated satisfactorily in the continuing environment of the current pandemic. Although the wave which commenced in September/October 2020 did not reach a peak until part way through the first quarter, the general economic environment remained very constrained and much of our business continued to be materially adversely affected. Happily, our strong emphasis on infrastructure generally, and railway, which has continued to perform at levels much as in 2020, was aided by early signs of recovery in branch UK recruitment and has made the profitable result for the period possible. Although there is still not a positive environment for the Derby Conference Centre and Hotel, our International Staffing Solutions business has continued at profitable levels.\nDuring the first six months more positive news on the vaccine roll-out has raised hopes of a period of recovery with a slow and bumpy return to improved profitability. However, there are additional head winds which present challenges for the immediate future and beyond.\nShareholders will be aware that all NATO forces have now been withdrawn from Afghanistan, which will, to all intents and purposes, herald the end of our main business in that country which has served us well for many years. Replacing that revenue is a high priority and whilst the Group continues to service other existing overseas contracts and secure replacement business, we must expect a period of lag in replacing this revenue.\nShareholders will also be aware that this year we are in the position of having to renew our contract with Network Rail. The tender process has now been completed and we should know the outcome of Network Rails decision in the second half of the year.\nAs was explained at the time of our Annual General Meeting in April, your Board is fully aware that the market in our shares is very limited. Accordingly, at these uncertain times, we have responded by renewing our authority to purchase our shares in the market up to 2,195,091 shares an amount equivalent to 14.99% of our outstanding capital at the time of the last Annual General Meeting.\nOther than the two factors mentioned above, the outcome for the remainder of 2021 depends on whether the present optimism over the vaccine roll-out and the consequential economic forecast plays out as the Government hopes. We will continue to manage the Group with caution and determination.\"\nThe interim report is available on the Company's website\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\n.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1835\nBill Douie, Chairman\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / James Keeshan\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nPanmure Gordon (Broker)\nNick Lovering\nwww.panmure\n.\ncom\nTel: 020 7886 2500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of clients.

Upon publication of this Announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nRTC Group Plc\n(\"RTC\", \"the Company\" or \"the Group\")\nOffer to Cancel Share Options and Share Buyback\nThe Company has today written to all employees who hold vested share options and offered to cancel them for a one-off cash consideration of 46.5p per share (\"the Cash Cancellation Offer\"), being the mid-market closing price per RTC Share on 21 May 2021, the last business day prior to this announcement (the \"Mid-market Closing Price\").\nIn addition, the Company intends to commence utilising the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2021 to make market purchases of up to\n2,195,091 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the capital of the Company.\nOption holders will have until 5pm on 28 May 2021 to confirm the number of options that they wish to be part of the Cash Cancellation. There are currently 2,046,605 share options capable of being exercised under the Cash Cancellation. If all such options are part of the Cash Cancellation Offer this would result in a payment of approximately \u00a30.95m being made to option holders. The Cash Cancellation Offer will be funded from the Company's cash resources and bank facilities.\nRelated Party Transaction\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Sarah Dye, Group Finance Director of the Company who hold 933,749 options and 679,259 options respectively have indicated that they will accept the Cash Cancellation Offer in respect of their options. The participation of Mr Pendlebury and Ms Dye in the Cash Cancellation Offer will be a related party transaction for the purposes of the AIM Rules.\nBill Douie, Chairman, who will not participate in the Cash Cancellation Offer (\"the Independent Director\"), believes that the Cash Cancellation Offer provides a cost-effective way of reducing the fully diluted number of shares in circulation, at a fair and fixed price. The Independent Director believes that this will enhance potential future fully diluted earnings per share and future dividends per share for shareholders. The Cash Cancellation Offer also provides a cost-effective way of providing remuneration due to the Chief Executive Officer, the Group Finance Director and certain employees in respect of their share options and also reflects their performance\nunder the ongoing highly stressful conditions well beyond the normal course of business.\nThe Independent Director therefore considers, having consulted with Spark, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the Cash Cancellation Offer are fair and reasonable in so far as Shareholders are concerned.\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1842\nBill Douie, Chairman\nAndy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / Mark Brady\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nPanmure Gordon (Broker)\nNick Lovering\nwww.panmure.com\nTel: 020 7886 2500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed recruitment business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting the best technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of UK and international clients.

At this time, no interim dividend is proposed for the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3199,734).\nCommenting on the results, Bill Douie, Chairman, said:\n\"\nI am particularly pleased to be able to report that our Group has managed to navigate its way successfully through an extraordinarily difficult six months and, despite an immediate drop in revenue across all our UK business streams due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have managed to deliver a modest first half profit and a significantly improved cash position. Cash generation in the period has principally benefitted from reduced working capital requirements through a combination of reduced revenues, accelerated payment terms from a key supplier and taking advantage of the Coronavirus VAT deferral Scheme.\nI believe our strategy of concentrating on supporting activities in public and regulated sectors (infrastructure and railway transportation) and providing contract workers vital to the country's long-term infrastructure development plans is proving sound during these very difficult times. I see it as encouraging for the future prospects of the Group.\nI am very proud of all of our hard-working employees who have shown exemplary commitment and spirit during these extremely challenging times and I believe we enter a demanding second six months with undiluted strength and determination to the credit of all concerned.\nGiven the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the impact of the pandemic, a further update on trading will be provided towards the end of the year.\"\nThe interim report is available on the Company's website\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\n.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 0133 286 1835\nBill Douie, Chairman, Andy Pendlebury, Chief Executive\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / James Keeshan\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nWhitman Howard Limited (Broker)\nNick Lovering\nwww.Whitman-howard.com\nTel: 020 7659 1234\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of UK and international clients.

Dividend was circa 4p in those days. If they go back to a 2:1 split, hopefully the final dividend will be around 2p (3p for the year). So, this may just be the start of the recovery with quite an uplift still to come. Let's see. Think they need a few reporting periods of positive progress to fully get back there.",

All in all, I can't see the SP getting much more traction than it currently has and will only progress further on further contract announcements or results showing a positive movement in profit. So much depends on market sentiment these days. All IMO DYOR",

The hotel and conference centre will also start to recover now lockdown is easing. There's no guidance for this year yet. Last year RTC made 4.7p EPS, whilst pre-pandemic forecasts for 2021 were 11.9p EPS. If RTC can show decent progress from last year's 4.7p EPS - especially with decent net cash against the \u00a34.2m m/cap - then there should be reasonable upside at some point. It's just a question of patience until then: Https://www.investegate.co.uk/rtc-group-plc--rtc-/rns/agm-trading-update/202104210700020892W/ Schwee, RTC had a very healthy \u00a31.9m net cash as at 31st December last.

The comments about the boom in provision of rail worker demand are perhaps even more important than the contract win itself: Https://www.wales247.co.uk/coleg-y-cymoedd-on-track-to-deliver-next-generation-of-rail-engineers Extract: \"Coleg y Cymoedd on track to deliver next generation of rail engineers By Rhys Gregory 7 hours ago One of the largest further education colleges in South Wales has teamed up with leading rail industry names to train the next generation of skilled railway workers and create hundreds of apprenticeships. Coleg y Cymoedd has partnered up with Protech Rail Engineering \u2013 a Treforest-based firm which provides engineering and construction expertise to the UK industry \u2013 to create the \u2018Protech Training Academy\u2019. The programme is designed to equip the country\u2019s future workforce with the skills and experience needed to meet future demand. The collaboration will also see Protech Training Academy team up with industry partner Ganymede, a national supplier of rail industry personnel, who will be the first employer to engage with the partnership, providing apprenticeships to learners on the programme. The company has recruited an initial 11 apprentices and is expecting to take on up to 100 over the next two years with opportunities for full time employment following their apprenticeships. Demand for skilled workers in the rail industry is set to soar following the announcement of multiple major rail infrastructure projects across the UK, as well as concerns over the loss of skills faced by the industry over the next few years due to its aging workforce. Estimates suggests that 28% of current rail industry employees are aged over 50 and City & Guilds predicts that an additional 120,000 people will be required in the sector over the next five to ten years to fulfil the requirements of upcoming schemes. In Wales alone, Transport for Wales has revealed a ten-year programme of major investments to improve the country\u2019s transport network including three quarters of a billion pounds to electrify the core valley lines as part of the South Wales metro project, \u00a3800m to develop new faster, greener trains as well as \u00a3194m to improve existing stations and create five brand new stations. etc\"",

Given recent updates from across the recruitment sector which have invariably led to downgrades this is a reassuring update and underlines its strategy of been able to rely on recurring income from its Ganymede and overseas GSS divisions for c60% of revenues as we expect the growth in these two divisions to offset anticipated declines in the UK based ATA recruitment division.  The improved cash position also gives us confidence that our dividend forecast for 2019 of 4.2p (2.4x covered) representing growth of 8% is achievable. Due to the diversified source of earnings, we believe, RTC should enjoy a higher rating (currently trading at a discount to the small-cap recruiters), with it trading on a 2019 PE rating of 6x and offering a yield of 7%.  Even at our price target of 100p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 10x and 4%.  We maintain our buy recommendation with the prelims expected on Feb 24th.\"",

From January 2020, Ganymede will be able to offer the rail, construction, energy, highways and water sectors a complete suite of diverse people solutions. From design, project management, commercial and engineering staff to on-site labour, Ganymede can now support clients throughout the full lifecycle of infrastructure projects, from tender to completion. ATA Recruitment, also part of the \u00a390m Derby-based RTC Group, boast over 50 years\u2019 experience in white-collar contract, permanent and executive recruitment, and have supported some of the UK\u2019s biggest rail and infrastructure projects. This expertise combined with Ganymede\u2019s workforce solution management capabilities makes the newly expanded Ganymede business a clear partner of choice for major infrastructure companies across the country. Operating within the same markets, and sharing many mutual clients, the decision to merge the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment was made with client offering and ease in mind. Paul Crompton, Managing Director of Ganymede who continues to head the business, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to announce the merger of Ganymede with the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment, which will create a large-scale business, offering a holistic client proposition. The aim of the combined business is to support our clients with diverse people solutions, offering the relevant skills to design, build and maintain infrastructure across the country. This is an exciting chapter in the growth of Ganymede which will create opportunities for our existing staff, alongside new jobs and a commitment to make a positive impact on wider society\u201d. From January 2020, Paul Crompton will also oversee ATA Recruitment as he is appointed as Managing Director to drive forward ATA Recruitment\u2019s existing engineering and manufacturing division, which will continue to operate from their established offices in Leicester and Leeds. With the merger of ATA\u2019s infrastructure and transportation divisions officially taking place seamlessly with Ganymede from the start of January 2020, clients will continue to receive the excellent level of service that the company strives to offer, along with the additional benefit of a much larger service offering from their regional offices in Derby, Doncaster, Crewe, Milton Keynes, London, Portsmouth and Cardiff. etc\"",

Two out of three divisions are doing well, and the company has reiterated confidence going forward, not least by increasing the already weighty dividend.

RTC released a brief year-end trading update stating that trading is in line with market expectations. ? The Chairman stated that continued growth of revenue and profit and an improvement in the net debt position is extremely pleasing. ? Results will be announced on or around 25 February. Allenby Capital comment It is encouraging to see a continuation of the improvement in headline numbers posted at the half year which showed revenues up 17% and PBT ahead by 31% especially given its (minor) exposure to Carillion, lower than expected volumes from Network Rail and government approval delays impacting Ganymede Energy\"",

If some of their anticipated news flow comes in then there could be upgrades all round as these are presumably pretty large-scale contracts.: https://*********************/companies/uk/training-recruitment-services/rtc-group/research/whitman-howard/estimates-confirmed/66e3e89f-cfc3-40b4-91d6-605e1b6febba 'We expect a number of announcements in 2019 which could positively impact our estimates. We expect RTC to announce a 1yr extension to its current Network Rail contract to include the period up to 2021, confirmation that it is bidding for the next five year Network Rail programme i.e. CP6, clarification that it is bidding for new work from Network Rail which is outside the remit of its traditional 5yr rolling contracts, new contract wins in GSS and an acceleration in the smart metering contracts as SSE is currently operating at levels below the guaranteed minimum. These events, plus the ongoing favourable trading will support our current 2019 PBT estimate of \u00a32.1m representing growth of 16%. Since the 2018 interims, sentiment has weighed against RTC due to the weaker first half trading and higher than expected net debt position. Given today\u2019s update successfully addresses both these issues, the valuation/growth metrics are attractive. Even at our price target of 95p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 8x and 4%. Given the recent PE exit multiple for Harvey Nash was 11.5x we do not believe our price target is unreasonable for a company with a proven and experienced management team.'",

If RTC can show decent progress from last year's 4.7p EPS - especially with decent net cash against the \u00a34.2m m/cap - then there should be reasonable upside at some point.

The comments about the boom in provision of rail worker demand are perhaps even more important than the contract win itself: Https://www.wales247.co.uk/coleg-y-cymoedd-on-track-to-deliver-next-generation-of-rail-engineers Extract: \"Coleg y Cymoedd on track to deliver next generation of rail engineers By Rhys Gregory 7 hours ago One of the largest further education colleges in South Wales has teamed up with leading rail industry names to train the next generation of skilled railway workers and create hundreds of apprenticeships. Coleg y Cymoedd has partnered up with Protech Rail Engineering \u2013 a Treforest-based firm which provides engineering and construction expertise to the UK industry \u2013 to create the \u2018Protech Training Academy\u2019. The programme is designed to equip the country\u2019s future workforce with the skills and experience needed to meet future demand. The collaboration will also see Protech Training Academy team up with industry partner Ganymede, a national supplier of rail industry personnel, who will be the first employer to engage with the partnership, providing apprenticeships to learners on the programme. The company has recruited an initial 11 apprentices and is expecting to take on up to 100 over the next two years with opportunities for full time employment following their apprenticeships. Demand for skilled workers in the rail industry is set to soar following the announcement of multiple major rail infrastructure projects across the UK, as well as concerns over the loss of skills faced by the industry over the next few years due to its aging workforce. Estimates suggests that 28% of current rail industry employees are aged over 50 and City & Guilds predicts that an additional 120,000 people will be required in the sector over the next five to ten years to fulfil the requirements of upcoming schemes. In Wales alone, Transport for Wales has revealed a ten-year programme of major investments to improve the country\u2019s transport network including three quarters of a billion pounds to electrify the core valley lines as part of the South Wales metro project, \u00a3800m to develop new faster, greener trains as well as \u00a3194m to improve existing stations and create five brand new stations. etc\"",

Our 2019 PBT estimate is \u00a31.9m while our current net debt forecast is \u00a34.1m (down from \u00a34.5m at December 2018).  Given recent updates from across the recruitment sector which have invariably led to downgrades this is a reassuring update and underlines its strategy of been able to rely on recurring income from its Ganymede and overseas GSS divisions for c60% of revenues as we expect the growth in these two divisions to offset anticipated declines in the UK based ATA recruitment division.  The improved cash position also gives us confidence that our dividend forecast for 2019 of 4.2p (2.4x covered) representing growth of 8% is achievable. Due to the diversified source of earnings, we believe, RTC should enjoy a higher rating (currently trading at a discount to the small-cap recruiters), with it trading on a 2019 PE rating of 6x and offering a yield of 7%.  Even at our price target of 100p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 10x and 4%.  We maintain our buy recommendation with the prelims expected on Feb 24th.\"",

From January 2020, Ganymede will be able to offer the rail, construction, energy, highways and water sectors a complete suite of diverse people solutions. From design, project management, commercial and engineering staff to on-site labour, Ganymede can now support clients throughout the full lifecycle of infrastructure projects, from tender to completion.

This expertise combined with Ganymede\u2019s workforce solution management capabilities makes the newly expanded Ganymede business a clear partner of choice for major infrastructure companies across the country. Operating within the same markets, and sharing many mutual clients, the decision to merge the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment was made with client offering and ease in mind. Paul Crompton, Managing Director of Ganymede who continues to head the business, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to announce the merger of Ganymede with the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment, which will create a large-scale business, offering a holistic client proposition. The aim of the combined business is to support our clients with diverse people solutions, offering the relevant skills to design, build and maintain infrastructure across the country. This is an exciting chapter in the growth of Ganymede which will create opportunities for our existing staff, alongside new jobs and a commitment to make a positive impact on wider society\u201d. From January 2020, Paul Crompton will also oversee ATA Recruitment as he is appointed as Managing Director to drive forward ATA Recruitment\u2019s existing engineering and manufacturing division, which will continue to operate from their established offices in Leicester and Leeds. With the merger of ATA\u2019s infrastructure and transportation divisions officially taking place seamlessly with Ganymede from the start of January 2020, clients will continue to receive the excellent level of service that the company strives to offer, along with the additional benefit of a much larger service offering from their regional offices in Derby, Doncaster, Crewe, Milton Keynes, London, Portsmouth and Cardiff. etc\"",

Two out of three divisions are doing well, and the company has reiterated confidence going forward, not least by increasing the already weighty dividend. Revenues have increased very nicely at Ganymede and GSS, but profits haven't increased at the same rate so not quite enough to offset the profit reduction at ATA. I wonder if there's been some heavy investment to fund this growth in Ganymede and GSS, with those costs reducing or paying off further from H2 (plus amortisation and depreciation have increased by \u00a391k year on year).",

If some of their anticipated news flow comes in then there could be upgrades all round as these are presumably pretty large-scale contracts.: https://*********************/companies/uk/training-recruitment-services/rtc-group/research/whitman-howard/estimates-confirmed/66e3e89f-cfc3-40b4-91d6-605e1b6febba 'We expect a number of announcements in 2019 which could positively impact our estimates. We expect RTC to announce a 1yr extension to its current Network Rail contract to include the period up to 2021, confirmation that it is bidding for the next five year Network Rail programme i.e. CP6, clarification that it is bidding for new work from Network Rail which is outside the remit of its traditional 5yr rolling contracts, new contract wins in GSS and an acceleration in the smart metering contracts as SSE is currently operating at levels below the guaranteed minimum. These events, plus the ongoing favourable trading will support our current 2019 PBT estimate of \u00a32.1m representing growth of 16%. Since the 2018 interims, sentiment has weighed against RTC due to the weaker first half trading and higher than expected net debt position. Given today\u2019s update successfully addresses both these issues, the valuation/growth metrics are attractive. Even at our price target of 95p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 8x and 4%. Given the recent PE exit multiple for Harvey Nash was 11.5x we do not believe our price target is unreasonable for a company with a proven and experienced management team.'",

All in all, I can't see the SP getting much more traction than it currently has and will only progress further on further contract announcements or results showing a positive movement in profit.

If RTC can show decent progress from last year's 4.7p EPS - especially with decent net cash against the \u00a34.2m m/cap - then there should be reasonable upside at some point.

The comments about the boom in provision of rail worker demand are perhaps even more important than the contract win itself: Https://www.wales247.co.uk/coleg-y-cymoedd-on-track-to-deliver-next-generation-of-rail-engineers Extract: \"Coleg y Cymoedd on track to deliver next generation of rail engineers By Rhys Gregory 7 hours ago One of the largest further education colleges in South Wales has teamed up with leading rail industry names to train the next generation of skilled railway workers and create hundreds of apprenticeships. Coleg y Cymoedd has partnered up with Protech Rail Engineering \u2013 a Treforest-based firm which provides engineering and construction expertise to the UK industry \u2013 to create the \u2018Protech Training Academy\u2019. The programme is designed to equip the country\u2019s future workforce with the skills and experience needed to meet future demand. The collaboration will also see Protech Training Academy team up with industry partner Ganymede, a national supplier of rail industry personnel, who will be the first employer to engage with the partnership, providing apprenticeships to learners on the programme. The company has recruited an initial 11 apprentices and is expecting to take on up to 100 over the next two years with opportunities for full time employment following their apprenticeships. Demand for skilled workers in the rail industry is set to soar following the announcement of multiple major rail infrastructure projects across the UK, as well as concerns over the loss of skills faced by the industry over the next few years due to its aging workforce. Estimates suggests that 28% of current rail industry employees are aged over 50 and City & Guilds predicts that an additional 120,000 people will be required in the sector over the next five to ten years to fulfil the requirements of upcoming schemes. In Wales alone, Transport for Wales has revealed a ten-year programme of major investments to improve the country\u2019s transport network including three quarters of a billion pounds to electrify the core valley lines as part of the South Wales metro project, \u00a3800m to develop new faster, greener trains as well as \u00a3194m to improve existing stations and create five brand new stations. etc\"",

They summarise as follows: \"RTC* \u2013 RTC.L, 62p, Mkt Cap \u00a39m, Buy (TP 100p) 2019 PBT in-line and improvement in the net debt position RTC has released a positive trading update for the 12 months to December 2019 which not only confirms that PBT is in-line but also the continued downward trend in net debt.  Our 2019 PBT estimate is \u00a31.9m while our current net debt forecast is \u00a34.1m (down from \u00a34.5m at December 2018).  Given recent updates from across the recruitment sector which have invariably led to downgrades this is a reassuring update and underlines its strategy of been able to rely on recurring income from its Ganymede and overseas GSS divisions for c60% of revenues as we expect the growth in these two divisions to offset anticipated declines in the UK based ATA recruitment division.  The improved cash position also gives us confidence that our dividend forecast for 2019 of 4.2p (2.4x covered) representing growth of 8% is achievable. Due to the diversified source of earnings, we believe, RTC should enjoy a higher rating (currently trading at a discount to the small-cap recruiters), with it trading on a 2019 PE rating of 6x and offering a yield of 7%.  Even at our price target of 100p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 10x and 4%.  We maintain our buy recommendation with the prelims expected on Feb 24th.\"",

From January 2020, Ganymede will be able to offer the rail, construction, energy, highways and water sectors a complete suite of diverse people solutions. From design, project management, commercial and engineering staff to on-site labour, Ganymede can now support clients throughout the full lifecycle of infrastructure projects, from tender to completion. ATA Recruitment, also part of the \u00a390m Derby-based RTC Group, boast over 50 years\u2019 experience in white-collar contract, permanent and executive recruitment, and have supported some of the UK\u2019s biggest rail and infrastructure projects. This expertise combined with Ganymede\u2019s workforce solution management capabilities makes the newly expanded Ganymede business a clear partner of choice for major infrastructure companies across the country. Operating within the same markets, and sharing many mutual clients, the decision to merge the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment was made with client offering and ease in mind. Paul Crompton, Managing Director of Ganymede who continues to head the business, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to announce the merger of Ganymede with the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment, which will create a large-scale business, offering a holistic client proposition. The aim of the combined business is to support our clients with diverse people solutions, offering the relevant skills to design, build and maintain infrastructure across the country. This is an exciting chapter in the growth of Ganymede which will create opportunities for our existing staff, alongside new jobs and a commitment to make a positive impact on wider society\u201d. From January 2020, Paul Crompton will also oversee ATA Recruitment as he is appointed as Managing Director to drive forward ATA Recruitment\u2019s existing engineering and manufacturing division, which will continue to operate from their established offices in Leicester and Leeds. With the merger of ATA\u2019s infrastructure and transportation divisions officially taking place seamlessly with Ganymede from the start of January 2020, clients will continue to receive the excellent level of service that the company strives to offer, along with the additional benefit of a much larger service offering from their regional offices in Derby, Doncaster, Crewe, Milton Keynes, London, Portsmouth and Cardiff. etc\"",

The illiquidity here tends to magnify the share price reactions. Two out of three divisions are doing well, and the company has reiterated confidence going forward, not least by increasing the already weighty dividend. Revenues have increased very nicely at Ganymede and GSS, but profits haven't increased at the same rate so not quite enough to offset the profit reduction at ATA. I wonder if there's been some heavy investment to fund this growth in Ganymede and GSS, with those costs reducing or paying off further from H2 (plus amortisation and depreciation have increased by \u00a391k year on year).",

The Chairman stated that continued growth of revenue and profit and an improvement in the net debt position is extremely pleasing. ? Results will be announced on or around 25 February. Allenby Capital comment It is encouraging to see a continuation of the improvement in headline numbers posted at the half year which showed revenues up 17% and PBT ahead by 31% especially given its (minor) exposure to Carillion, lower than expected volumes from Network Rail and government approval delays impacting Ganymede Energy\"",

If some of their anticipated news flow comes in then there could be upgrades all round as these are presumably pretty large-scale contracts.: https://*********************/companies/uk/training-recruitment-services/rtc-group/research/whitman-howard/estimates-confirmed/66e3e89f-cfc3-40b4-91d6-605e1b6febba 'We expect a number of announcements in 2019 which could positively impact our estimates. We expect RTC to announce a 1yr extension to its current Network Rail contract to include the period up to 2021, confirmation that it is bidding for the next five year Network Rail programme i.e. CP6, clarification that it is bidding for new work from Network Rail which is outside the remit of its traditional 5yr rolling contracts, new contract wins in GSS and an acceleration in the smart metering contracts as SSE is currently operating at levels below the guaranteed minimum. These events, plus the ongoing favourable trading will support our current 2019 PBT estimate of \u00a32.1m representing growth of 16%. Since the 2018 interims, sentiment has weighed against RTC due to the weaker first half trading and higher than expected net debt position. Given today\u2019s update successfully addresses both these issues, the valuation/growth metrics are attractive. Even at our price target of 95p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 8x and 4%. Given the recent PE exit multiple for Harvey Nash was 11.5x we do not believe our price target is unreasonable for a company with a proven and experienced management team.'",

Dividend was circa 4p in those days. If they go back to a 2:1 split, hopefully the final dividend will be around 2p (3p for the year). So, this may just be the start of the recovery with quite an uplift still to come. Let's see. Think they need a few reporting periods of positive progress to fully get back there.",

All in all, I can't see the SP getting much more traction than it currently has and will only progress further on further contract announcements or results showing a positive movement in profit. So much depends on market sentiment these days. All IMO DYOR",

The hotel and conference centre will also start to recover now lockdown is easing. There's no guidance for this year yet. Last year RTC made 4.7p EPS, whilst pre-pandemic forecasts for 2021 were 11.9p EPS. If RTC can show decent progress from last year's 4.7p EPS - especially with decent net cash against the \u00a34.2m m/cap - then there should be reasonable upside at some point. It's just a question of patience until then: Https://www.investegate.co.uk/rtc-group-plc--rtc-/rns/agm-trading-update/202104210700020892W/ Schwee, RTC had a very healthy \u00a31.9m net cash as at 31st December last.

The comments about the boom in provision of rail worker demand are perhaps even more important than the contract win itself: Https://www.wales247.co.uk/coleg-y-cymoedd-on-track-to-deliver-next-generation-of-rail-engineers Extract: \"Coleg y Cymoedd on track to deliver next generation of rail engineers By Rhys Gregory 7 hours ago One of the largest further education colleges in South Wales has teamed up with leading rail industry names to train the next generation of skilled railway workers and create hundreds of apprenticeships. Coleg y Cymoedd has partnered up with Protech Rail Engineering \u2013 a Treforest-based firm which provides engineering and construction expertise to the UK industry \u2013 to create the \u2018Protech Training Academy\u2019. The programme is designed to equip the country\u2019s future workforce with the skills and experience needed to meet future demand. The collaboration will also see Protech Training Academy team up with industry partner Ganymede, a national supplier of rail industry personnel, who will be the first employer to engage with the partnership, providing apprenticeships to learners on the programme. The company has recruited an initial 11 apprentices and is expecting to take on up to 100 over the next two years with opportunities for full time employment following their apprenticeships. Demand for skilled workers in the rail industry is set to soar following the announcement of multiple major rail infrastructure projects across the UK, as well as concerns over the loss of skills faced by the industry over the next few years due to its aging workforce. Estimates suggests that 28% of current rail industry employees are aged over 50 and City & Guilds predicts that an additional 120,000 people will be required in the sector over the next five to ten years to fulfil the requirements of upcoming schemes. In Wales alone, Transport for Wales has revealed a ten-year programme of major investments to improve the country\u2019s transport network including three quarters of a billion pounds to electrify the core valley lines as part of the South Wales metro project, \u00a3800m to develop new faster, greener trains as well as \u00a3194m to improve existing stations and create five brand new stations. etc\"",

They summarise as follows: \"RTC* \u2013 RTC.L, 62p, Mkt Cap \u00a39m, Buy (TP 100p) 2019 PBT in-line and improvement in the net debt position RTC has released a positive trading update for the 12 months to December 2019 which not only confirms that PBT is in-line but also the continued downward trend in net debt.  Our 2019 PBT estimate is \u00a31.9m while our current net debt forecast is \u00a34.1m (down from \u00a34.5m at December 2018).  Given recent updates from across the recruitment sector which have invariably led to downgrades this is a reassuring update and underlines its strategy of been able to rely on recurring income from its Ganymede and overseas GSS divisions for c60% of revenues as we expect the growth in these two divisions to offset anticipated declines in the UK based ATA recruitment division.  The improved cash position also gives us confidence that our dividend forecast for 2019 of 4.2p (2.4x covered) representing growth of 8% is achievable. Due to the diversified source of earnings, we believe, RTC should enjoy a higher rating (currently trading at a discount to the small-cap recruiters), with it trading on a 2019 PE rating of 6x and offering a yield of 7%.  Even at our price target of 100p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 10x and 4%.  We maintain our buy recommendation with the prelims expected on Feb 24th.\"",

From January 2020, Ganymede will be able to offer the rail, construction, energy, highways and water sectors a complete suite of diverse people solutions. From design, project management, commercial and engineering staff to on-site labour, Ganymede can now support clients throughout the full lifecycle of infrastructure projects, from tender to completion.

This expertise combined with Ganymede\u2019s workforce solution management capabilities makes the newly expanded Ganymede business a clear partner of choice for major infrastructure companies across the country. Operating within the same markets, and sharing many mutual clients, the decision to merge the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment was made with client offering and ease in mind. Paul Crompton, Managing Director of Ganymede who continues to head the business, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to announce the merger of Ganymede with the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment, which will create a large-scale business, offering a holistic client proposition. The aim of the combined business is to support our clients with diverse people solutions, offering the relevant skills to design, build and maintain infrastructure across the country. This is an exciting chapter in the growth of Ganymede which will create opportunities for our existing staff, alongside new jobs and a commitment to make a positive impact on wider society\u201d. From January 2020, Paul Crompton will also oversee ATA Recruitment as he is appointed as Managing Director to drive forward ATA Recruitment\u2019s existing engineering and manufacturing division, which will continue to operate from their established offices in Leicester and Leeds. With the merger of ATA\u2019s infrastructure and transportation divisions officially taking place seamlessly with Ganymede from the start of January 2020, clients will continue to receive the excellent level of service that the company strives to offer, along with the additional benefit of a much larger service offering from their regional offices in Derby, Doncaster, Crewe, Milton Keynes, London, Portsmouth and Cardiff. etc\"",

Two out of three divisions are doing well, and the company has reiterated confidence going forward, not least by increasing the already weighty dividend.

Which makes the forecast 11.6p EPS (and 4.24p dividend) for this year look pretty achievable: \"RTC Group plc (RTC.L, 56.5p/\u00a38.3m) Full year trading update to 31.12.18 (25.01.19) ? RTC released a brief year-end trading update stating that trading is in line with market expectations. ? The Chairman stated that continued growth of revenue and profit and an improvement in the net debt position is extremely pleasing. ? Results will be announced on or around 25 February. Allenby Capital comment It is encouraging to see a continuation of the improvement in headline numbers posted at the half year which showed revenues up 17% and PBT ahead by 31% especially given its (minor) exposure to Carillion, lower than expected volumes from Network Rail and government approval delays impacting Ganymede Energy\"",

If some of their anticipated news flow comes in then there could be upgrades all round as these are presumably pretty large-scale contracts.: https://*********************/companies/uk/training-recruitment-services/rtc-group/research/whitman-howard/estimates-confirmed/66e3e89f-cfc3-40b4-91d6-605e1b6febba 'We expect a number of announcements in 2019 which could positively impact our estimates. We expect RTC to announce a 1yr extension to its current Network Rail contract to include the period up to 2021, confirmation that it is bidding for the next five year Network Rail programme i.e. CP6, clarification that it is bidding for new work from Network Rail which is outside the remit of its traditional 5yr rolling contracts, new contract wins in GSS and an acceleration in the smart metering contracts as SSE is currently operating at levels below the guaranteed minimum. These events, plus the ongoing favourable trading will support our current 2019 PBT estimate of \u00a32.1m representing growth of 16%. Since the 2018 interims, sentiment has weighed against RTC due to the weaker first half trading and higher than expected net debt position. Given today\u2019s update successfully addresses both these issues, the valuation/growth metrics are attractive. Even at our price target of 95p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 8x and 4%. Given the recent PE exit multiple for Harvey Nash was 11.5x we do not believe our price target is unreasonable for a company with a proven and experienced management team.'",

All in all, I can't see the SP getting much more traction than it currently has and will only progress further on further contract announcements or results showing a positive movement in profit. So much depends on market sentiment these days. All IMO DYOR",

Last year RTC made 4.7p EPS, whilst pre-pandemic forecasts for 2021 were 11.9p EPS. If RTC can show decent progress from last year's 4.7p EPS - especially with decent net cash against the \u00a34.2m m/cap - then there should be reasonable upside at some point.

The comments about the boom in provision of rail worker demand are perhaps even more important than the contract win itself: Https://www.wales247.co.uk/coleg-y-cymoedd-on-track-to-deliver-next-generation-of-rail-engineers Extract: \"Coleg y Cymoedd on track to deliver next generation of rail engineers By Rhys Gregory 7 hours ago One of the largest further education colleges in South Wales has teamed up with leading rail industry names to train the next generation of skilled railway workers and create hundreds of apprenticeships. Coleg y Cymoedd has partnered up with Protech Rail Engineering \u2013 a Treforest-based firm which provides engineering and construction expertise to the UK industry \u2013 to create the \u2018Protech Training Academy\u2019. The programme is designed to equip the country\u2019s future workforce with the skills and experience needed to meet future demand. The collaboration will also see Protech Training Academy team up with industry partner Ganymede, a national supplier of rail industry personnel, who will be the first employer to engage with the partnership, providing apprenticeships to learners on the programme. The company has recruited an initial 11 apprentices and is expecting to take on up to 100 over the next two years with opportunities for full time employment following their apprenticeships. Demand for skilled workers in the rail industry is set to soar following the announcement of multiple major rail infrastructure projects across the UK, as well as concerns over the loss of skills faced by the industry over the next few years due to its aging workforce. Estimates suggests that 28% of current rail industry employees are aged over 50 and City & Guilds predicts that an additional 120,000 people will be required in the sector over the next five to ten years to fulfil the requirements of upcoming schemes. In Wales alone, Transport for Wales has revealed a ten-year programme of major investments to improve the country\u2019s transport network including three quarters of a billion pounds to electrify the core valley lines as part of the South Wales metro project, \u00a3800m to develop new faster, greener trains as well as \u00a3194m to improve existing stations and create five brand new stations. etc\"",

Our 2019 PBT estimate is \u00a31.9m while our current net debt forecast is \u00a34.1m (down from \u00a34.5m at December 2018).  Given recent updates from across the recruitment sector which have invariably led to downgrades this is a reassuring update and underlines its strategy of been able to rely on recurring income from its Ganymede and overseas GSS divisions for c60% of revenues as we expect the growth in these two divisions to offset anticipated declines in the UK based ATA recruitment division.  The improved cash position also gives us confidence that our dividend forecast for 2019 of 4.2p (2.4x covered) representing growth of 8% is achievable. Due to the diversified source of earnings, we believe, RTC should enjoy a higher rating (currently trading at a discount to the small-cap recruiters), with it trading on a 2019 PE rating of 6x and offering a yield of 7%.  Even at our price target of 100p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 10x and 4%.  We maintain our buy recommendation with the prelims expected on Feb 24th.\"",

From January 2020, Ganymede will be able to offer the rail, construction, energy, highways and water sectors a complete suite of diverse people solutions. From design, project management, commercial and engineering staff to on-site labour, Ganymede can now support clients throughout the full lifecycle of infrastructure projects, from tender to completion. ATA Recruitment, also part of the \u00a390m Derby-based RTC Group, boast over 50 years\u2019 experience in white-collar contract, permanent and executive recruitment, and have supported some of the UK\u2019s biggest rail and infrastructure projects. This expertise combined with Ganymede\u2019s workforce solution management capabilities makes the newly expanded Ganymede business a clear partner of choice for major infrastructure companies across the country. Operating within the same markets, and sharing many mutual clients, the decision to merge the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment was made with client offering and ease in mind. Paul Crompton, Managing Director of Ganymede who continues to head the business, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to announce the merger of Ganymede with the infrastructure and transportation divisions of ATA Recruitment, which will create a large-scale business, offering a holistic client proposition. The aim of the combined business is to support our clients with diverse people solutions, offering the relevant skills to design, build and maintain infrastructure across the country. This is an exciting chapter in the growth of Ganymede which will create opportunities for our existing staff, alongside new jobs and a commitment to make a positive impact on wider society\u201d. From January 2020, Paul Crompton will also oversee ATA Recruitment as he is appointed as Managing Director to drive forward ATA Recruitment\u2019s existing engineering and manufacturing division, which will continue to operate from their established offices in Leicester and Leeds. With the merger of ATA\u2019s infrastructure and transportation divisions officially taking place seamlessly with Ganymede from the start of January 2020, clients will continue to receive the excellent level of service that the company strives to offer, along with the additional benefit of a much larger service offering from their regional offices in Derby, Doncaster, Crewe, Milton Keynes, London, Portsmouth and Cardiff. etc\"",

Two out of three divisions are doing well, and the company has reiterated confidence going forward, not least by increasing the already weighty dividend.

If some of their anticipated news flow comes in then there could be upgrades all round as these are presumably pretty large-scale contracts.: https://*********************/companies/uk/training-recruitment-services/rtc-group/research/whitman-howard/estimates-confirmed/66e3e89f-cfc3-40b4-91d6-605e1b6febba 'We expect a number of announcements in 2019 which could positively impact our estimates. We expect RTC to announce a 1yr extension to its current Network Rail contract to include the period up to 2021, confirmation that it is bidding for the next five year Network Rail programme i.e. CP6, clarification that it is bidding for new work from Network Rail which is outside the remit of its traditional 5yr rolling contracts, new contract wins in GSS and an acceleration in the smart metering contracts as SSE is currently operating at levels below the guaranteed minimum. These events, plus the ongoing favourable trading will support our current 2019 PBT estimate of \u00a32.1m representing growth of 16%. Since the 2018 interims, sentiment has weighed against RTC due to the weaker first half trading and higher than expected net debt position. Given today\u2019s update successfully addresses both these issues, the valuation/growth metrics are attractive. Even at our price target of 95p the 2019E PE rating and dividend yield would still only be 8x and 4%. Given the recent PE exit multiple for Harvey Nash was 11.5x we do not believe our price target is unreasonable for a company with a proven and experienced management team.'",
