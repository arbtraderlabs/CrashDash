Upon publication of this Announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n26 November 2025\nRTC Group Plc\n(\"RTC\", \"the Company\" or \"the Group\")\nTrading Update and Notice of Results\nRTC Group Plc (AIM:RTC.L) is pleased to announce that, despite a challenging UK economy which has impacted recruitment generally, and the significant additional cost burdens imposed by the government's decision to increase employers' national insurance contributions in the Autumn Budget 2024, the Group's expects to deliver a set of results for the year ending 31 December 2025, that are broadly in line with last year.\nWhilst there is a broad feeling of uncertainty across many industry sectors in the United Kingdom, we firmly believe that our group business model of building long-term strategic relationships with blue chip clients, in both domestic and international markets, will continue to provide long-term order book opportunities for RTC, as many of our clients are committed to extended investment horizons.\nWe believe that our Group's strong and proven capabilities in relation to strategically important assets on which the country depends will ensure value longevity for our shareholders across a broad range of long-term investment programmes and for an extended period into the future.\nWhilst we note the current well-advertised softness in the rail sector, an important area for our company, the healthy progress made by our energy business in particular, is a strong validation of the successful diversified strategy pursued by the Group for a number of years. We therefore remain cautiously optimistic of our future prospects as the 2025 trading period comes to a close.\nAt the 2025 AGM the Company outlined plans to drive increased shareholder engagement. As part of this process, we have engaged Investor Meet, a UK based platform which connects public companies and investors digitally for live and on-demand presentations and Q&A sessions.\nO\nur first investor briefing through that medium will be following the release of our audited results announcement for the year ended 31 December 2025, on or around 23 March 2026. Beyond this, we are strongly committed to ensuring the availability of broker's research both to our shareholders and to the broader investment community following the announcement of our 2025 results.\nAndy Pendlebury, Chairman and CEO, said:\n\"I am delighted the Group expects to deliver such a strong set of results given the current market conditions. Results which will further exhibit the resilience and potential of our operations.\nI believe the Group has continued to demonstrate the strength of its offering through its strong and growing order book across its key target markets. Our balance sheet continues to operate free of term debt, enhancing year-on-year earnings and net value per share for its shareholders and positioning us well to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise.\nAt both Group and subsidiary level, we have strong management teams who have continued to navigate market challenges and opportunities to a high degree of effectiveness.\nOur Group, whilst mindful of the uncertainties facing both the domestic and global economy, has many reasons to remain positive about its future prospects '\n~ Ends ~\nEnquiries:\nRTC Group Plc\nTel: 01332 861 816\nAndy Pendlebury, Chairman and Chief Executive\nwww.rtcgroupplc.co.uk\nContact Us - RTC Group Plc\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nMatt Davis / James Keeshan\nwww.Sparkadvisorypartners.com\nTel: 0203 368 3550\nSI Capital (Broker)\nNick Emerson / Sam Lomanto\nwww.sicapital.co.uk\nTel:\n0148 341 3500\nAbout RTC\nRTC Group Plc is an AIM listed recruitment business that focuses on white and blue-collar recruitment, providing temporary and permanent labour to a broad range of industries and customers in both domestic and international markets through its geographically defined operating divisions.\nUK division\nThrough its Ganymede and ATA Recruitment brands the Group provides a wide range of recruitment services in the UK.\nGanymede specialise in recruiting the best technical and engineering talent and providing complete workforce solutions to help build and maintain infrastructure and transportation for a wide range of UK and international clients.
