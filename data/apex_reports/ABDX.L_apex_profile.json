Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAbingdon Health plc\n(\"Abingdon Health\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update\n45% increase in H1 FY26 revenues\nConfident commercial outlook\nYork, U.K. 15 January 2026:\nAbingdon Health plc (AIM: ABDX), a leading international developer, manufacturer and regulatory services provider for rapid diagnostic tests and med-tech, provides its half-year trading update for the six months ended 31 December 2025.\nTotal revenues in the six months ended 31 December 2025 (\"H1 FY26\") grew by 45% to \u00a34.5 million (H1 FY25: \u00a33.1 million), driven by several significant commercial contracts announced during the past year. H1 FY26 includes an element of grant-funded contract development revenue which will be presented in 'other operating income' as required by accounting standards.\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2025 were \u00a33.6 million (30 June 2025: \u00a31.9 million). This followed the Company's recent fundraise in\nOctober 2025\nwhich raised \u00a33.2m net of expenses to accelerate expansion operations in the USA and enhance working capital required in new higher revenue-generating projects including recent major contract wins and future anticipated pipeline opportunities.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead to the second half of the financial year the Board remains confident in the commercial outlook for the Company, supported by several significant contracts announced and commenced during H1 FY26. As in prior years, revenue for the financial year ending 30 June 2026 (\"FY26\") is expected to be weighted towards the second half of the financial year.\nThe Board is maintaining its revenue guidance for FY26, including grant-funded income, in line with market expectations of \u00a312.6 million (\u00a312.2m plus \u00a30.4m grant funded revenue). The mix of forecasted revenue for H2 has changed as the Group executes on its recently announced contract wins. The expected revenue from current customer Find Out From Home (FOFH) is now expected to be realised in FY27 as FOFH performs a fundraising process. Despite that adjustment, the Board remains confident in the revenue outlook for FY26.\nEBITDA for FY26 will be driven in part by new customer wins and by the speed of acceleration of USA expansion, where the Company is currently increasing its lateral flow development and manufacturing footprint at its Madison, WI facilities to satisfy customer demand. The Board anticipates H2 FY26 to be profitable and operating cash flow positive whilst the outturn for the year will depend largely on anticipated continued commercial progress throughout H2.The Company expects to report its results for H1 FY26 in March 2026, where a further update will be provided.\nInvestor presentation\nDr Chris Hand, Executive Chairman, will be presenting this evening, Thursday 15 January 2026, at the Proactive One2One Investor Forum in London. Further information may be found at\nProactive Investors\nand the investor presentation will be made available in the investor relations section of Abingdon Health's website after the event.\nChris Hand, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report substantial revenue growth in the first six months of the financial year, and the outlook for the rest of FY26 and beyond remains positive. We have made significant commercial and operational progress via our integrated end-to-end CDMO and CRO service offering which has supported us in securing several major contracts as previously announced, and this momentum is expected to continue in the coming year and beyond.\"\nEnquiries:\nAbingdon Health plc\nwww.abingdonhealth.com/investors/\nChris Hand,\u00a0Executive\nChairman\nVia Walbrook PR\nT\nom Hayes, CFO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Sole Broker and Nominated Adviser)\nTel:\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nGeoff Nash / Isaac Hooper /\nJoe Smith\n(Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Science Specialist Sales)\nWalbrook PR (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nabingdon@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus\u00a0/\u00a0Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Abingdon Health\nAbingdon Health\u00a0Group\u00a0is a leading med-tech contract service provider offering its services to an international customer base.\nThe Group's\nCDMO\n(Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation) expertise offers lateral flow product development, regulatory support, technology transfer and manufacturing services for customers looking to develop new assays or transfer existing laboratory-based assays to a lateral flow format.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAbingdon Health plc\n(\"Abingdon Health\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update\n45% increase in H1 FY26 revenues\nConfident commercial outlook\nYork, U.K. 15 January 2026:\nAbingdon Health plc (AIM: ABDX), a leading international developer, manufacturer and regulatory services provider for rapid diagnostic tests and med-tech, provides its half-year trading update for the six months ended 31 December 2025.\nTotal revenues in the six months ended 31 December 2025 (\"H1 FY26\") grew by 45% to \u00a34.5 million (H1 FY25: \u00a33.1 million), driven by several significant commercial contracts announced during the past year. H1 FY26 includes an element of grant-funded contract development revenue which will be presented in 'other operating income' as required by accounting standards.\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2025 were \u00a33.6 million (30 June 2025: \u00a31.9 million). This followed the Company's recent fundraise in\nOctober 2025\nwhich raised \u00a33.2m net of expenses to accelerate expansion operations in the USA and enhance working capital required in new higher revenue-generating projects including recent major contract wins and future anticipated pipeline opportunities.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead to the second half of the financial year the Board remains confident in the commercial outlook for the Company, supported by several significant contracts announced and commenced during H1 FY26. As in prior years, revenue for the financial year ending 30 June 2026 (\"FY26\") is expected to be weighted towards the second half of the financial year.\nThe Board is maintaining its revenue guidance for FY26, including grant-funded income, in line with market expectations of \u00a312.6 million (\u00a312.2m plus \u00a30.4m grant funded revenue). The mix of forecasted revenue for H2 has changed as the Group executes on its recently announced contract wins. The expected revenue from current customer Find Out From Home (FOFH) is now expected to be realised in FY27 as FOFH performs a fundraising process. Despite that adjustment, the Board remains confident in the revenue outlook for FY26.\nEBITDA for FY26 will be driven in part by new customer wins and by the speed of acceleration of USA expansion, where the Company is currently increasing its lateral flow development and manufacturing footprint at its Madison, WI facilities to satisfy customer demand. The Board anticipates H2 FY26 to be profitable and operating cash flow positive whilst the outturn for the year will depend largely on anticipated continued commercial progress throughout H2.The Company expects to report its results for H1 FY26 in March 2026, where a further update will be provided.\nInvestor presentation\nDr Chris Hand, Executive Chairman, will be presenting this evening, Thursday 15 January 2026, at the Proactive One2One Investor Forum in London. Further information may be found at\nProactive Investors\nand the investor presentation will be made available in the investor relations section of Abingdon Health's website after the event.\nChris Hand, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report substantial revenue growth in the first six months of the financial year, and the outlook for the rest of FY26 and beyond remains positive.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nAbingdon Health plc\n(\"Abingdon Health\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nLaunch of seaweed-based lateral flow housings\nAlternative to standard plastic housings to reduce plastic waste from LFTs\nAbingdon Health plc (AIM: ABDX), a leading international developer, manufacturer and regulatory services provider for rapid diagnostic tests and med-tech, announces the launch of a seaweed-based alternative housing for its contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) customers for the development and manufacture of lateral flow tests (LFTs).\nThe Company has agreed an exclusive supply agreement with Wolverhampton based\nSymbio Technologies Ltd\n(\"SymbioTex\") for the supply of compostable bio-based material derived from red-seaweed which can be used to produce lateral flow cassettes via standard injection moulding techniques. This option will provide an alternative to the standard plastic houses that are currently used and create opportunity for Abingdon customers to significantly reduce their plastic waste.\nThe Company has developed prototype cassettes in both standard format and in mid-stream urine sample format as is used for pregnancy and fertility testing.\nExamples of the Company's seaweed-based housings with, on the left side, a positive (left) and negative (right) test for the plant disease Phytopthora spp from the Company's\nPocket Diagnostic\u00ae\nrange using blue latex as signal.\nAnd on the right side, positive (left) and negative (right) pregnancy tests using colloidal gold label in seaweed-based housings in mid-stream urine format as used in pregnancy and fertility testing.\nOlivia Simpson, Managing Director of\nSymbioTex, commented\n: \"\nSymbioTex is delighted to\u00a0have agreed the exclusive supply\u00a0of our seaweed-based home compostable biomaterial to\u00a0Abingdon\u00a0Health.\nIt is a truly home compostable, sustainable material that can be used to revolutionise the production of packaging and medical devices currently made from single-use plastic.\"\nDr Chris Hand, Executive Chairman of Abingdon Health plc, commented:\n\"\nLFTs are crucial for rapid diagnostic testing with over 2 billion used annually across the globe. However, this generates\ngreater than 20,000\u00a0tonnes\nof plastic waste. By offering a plastic free rigid cassette in a range of formats, Abingdon Health aims to help our CDMO customers reduce plastic waste without compromising on the functionality of the tests. The use of SymbioTex's material, as well as harnessing the power of renewable natural resources, gives us the practical benefit of using traditional\nplastic\u00a0injection moulding\nmachinery thereby easing the development pathway\".\nEnquiries:\nAbingdon Health plc\nwww.abingdonhealth.com/investors/\nChris Hand,\u00a0Executive\nChairman\nVia Walbrook PR\nTom Hayes, CFO\nZeus (Sole Broker and Nominated Adviser)\nTel:\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nAntonio Bossi / Jacob Walker (Corporate Finance)\nWalbrook PR (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nabingdon@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus\u00a0/\u00a0Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout\u00a0Abingdon Health plc\nAbingdon Health\u00a0Group\u00a0is a leading med-tech contract service provider offering its services to an international customer base.\nThe Group's\nCDMO\nexpertise offers lateral flow product development, regulatory support, technology transfer and manufacturing services for customers looking to develop new assays or transfer existing laboratory-based assays to a lateral flow format.

Project details are confidential, but the wide-ranging areas currently in progress via contract development projects with US customers include:\n\u00b7\nDevelopment of a duplex lateral flow to quantitatively measure the concentrations of a pharmaceutical product and its metabolite.\n\u00b7\nDevelopment of a lateral flow veterinary product for use initially in canine samples.\n\u00b7\nFeasibility work with a leading US university to evaluate novel nanoparticles for use in a lateral flow format.\n\u00b7\nDevelopment of a lateral flow test for infectious disease initially in bovine animals.\n\u00b7\nDevelopment of a test for an infectious agent in animals and humans, with a spin-out of leading US university.\nAll of these projects are being run from the Madison facility with support from colleagues at the Company's UK facilities.\nThese contract wins underline the importance of Abingdon Health's expansion of its CDMO offering in the US, extending its global reach to current and new US-based clients. Abingdon Health's value proposition, which provides customers with comprehensive support to take an \"idea through to commercial success\", is resonating well in the USA.\nExpansion of US facility\nAbingdon Health also announces that the second phase of its US facility expansion in Madison is underway with plans commenced for the installation of high-throughput manufacturing to enable the seamless transition of projects from development into manufacturing. The manufacturing equipment will mirror Abingdon Health's UK operation to allow customers to manufacture under the same operating conditions and quality management system in either the USA, the UK, or both. This provides customers with unrivalled geographic optionality during a period of tariff and supply chain uncertainty and provides US customers with the confidence that products \"developed in the USA\" by the Company's highly skilled CDMO team can also be \"made in the USA\".\nDetails of Abingdon Health's comprehensive CDMO capabilities can be found in the brochure here:\nhttps://www.abingdonhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Abingdon-Health-Group-Leaflet-JUN2025.pdf\nDr Chris Hand, Executive Chairman of Abingdon Health plc, commented\n:\n\"These contract awards validate our decision to expand our CDMO operations into the USA and we anticipate further expansion in Madison, Wisconsin, as projects and products move through the development cycle. It is pleasing to see our US customers recognise the value of our comprehensive CDMO platform. We deliver end-to-end diagnostic solutions from initial concept through to market launch, and these contract wins illustrate strong confidence in our approach from US-based clients\".\nEnquiries:\nAbingdon Health plc\nwww.abingdonhealth.com/investors/\nChris Hand,\u00a0Executive\nChairman\nVia Walbrook PR\nT\nom Hayes, CFO\nZeus (Sole Broker and Nominated Adviser)\nTel:\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nAntonio Bossi / Jacob Walker (Corporate Finance)\nFraser Marshall\u00a0(Corporate Broking)\nWalbrook PR (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nabingdon@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus\u00a0/\u00a0Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout\u00a0Abingdon Health plc\nAbingdon Health\u00a0Group\u00a0is a leading med-tech contract service provider offering its services to an international customer base.\nThe Group's\nCDMO\nexpertise offers lateral flow product development, regulatory support, technology transfer and manufacturing services for customers looking to develop new assays or transfer existing laboratory-based assays to a lateral flow format.

The partnership will initially focus on two key use cases: bovine health testing via milk samples and human health applications via nasal pharyngeal fluid.\nThe agreement grants Abingdon Health exclusive rights to distribute the final test kits globally, with a profit share agreement between both companies.\nAn April 2025 publication in the Lancet 1 outlined:\n\"The recent emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus infections in dairy cows and humans in the U.S. has raised alarms regarding the potential for a pandemic. Over 995 dairy cow herds and at least 70 humans have been affected, including cases of severe disease and the first reported H5N1-related death in the U.S. Sporadic human infections with no known contact with infected animals highlight the possibility of viral adaptation for efficient human-to-human transmission. Concurrently, the virus continues to circulate in wild birds, backyard flocks, and hunted migratory species, further amplifying the risk to humans and domestic animals\".\nDr Chris Hand, Executive Chairman of Abingdon Health plc, commented:\n\"We are excited to partner with Okos Diagnostics to bring these innovative lateral flow tests to the global market. This collaboration perfectly aligns with our mission to improve health by making rapid tests accessible to all. By combining Okos' excellent work to date on developing prototypes with our scale-up, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialisation capabilities, we're well-positioned to deliver high-quality diagnostic solutions that address these important health needs. Additionally, the state of Wisconsin, USA has already announced that it will begin the of testing of cows' milk for avian flu2 which indicates the rapidly increasing market for this test.\"\nSander Brus, CEO of Okos Diagnostics B.V., commented:\n\"This partnership with Abingdon Health represents a significant opportunity to commercialise our lateral flow avian flu (H5N1) technology across multiple markets. We believe our innovative diagnostic approach to this biomarker, combined with Abingdon's scale-up and manufacturing excellence and global reach, will allow us to bring valuable testing solutions to customers worldwide.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAbingdon Health plc\n(\"Abingdon Health\" or \"the Company\")\nFunding award to develop test for malaria parasite\nPoint-of-care rapid diagnostic test for Plasmodium vivax infection to be developed for in-field testing\nYork, U.K.\u00a027 January 2025:\nAbingdon Health plc (AIM: ABDX), a leading international developer, manufacturer and distributor of high quality and effective rapid tests, announces that it has\nbeen awarded approximately \u00a3800,000 as part of total project funding of EUR 5m to develop, and transfer to manufacture, a new intervention for malaria elimination as part of a distinguished group of\nInstitut Pasteur\n(and its affiliates in Madagascar and Senegal), the\nArmauer Hansen Research Institute\nin Ethiopia,\nFIND\n,\nLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine\n(LSHTM) and\nWalter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research\n(WEHI). The project is scheduled to begin in February 2025 and be delivered over 24 months.\nThe funding to Abingdon Health, which will be provided by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) under the 'Horizon Europe Guarantee' scheme, is to allow the Company to lead the development of a point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for\nPlasmodium vivax (P.vivax)\ninfection to support in-field testing and treatment to facilitate malaria control strategy\n.\nThe primary purpose of the PvSeroRDT (\nP. vivax\nSerological Rapid Detection Test) project is to develop a POC RDT for field-based implementation that replicates lab-based tests for the detection of\nP. vivax.\nOnce the RDT has successfully been developed, Abingdon Health will transfer the product to diaTROPIX, a Senegalese manufacturing organisation based at\nInstitut Pasteur Dakar\n. Establishing African-based manufacturing is important in helping to build new infrastructure, aiming to facilitate the preparation, management, and response to infectious diseases. Abingdon Health is committed to ensuring the support of the scaling up, transfer to manufacturing and support to diaTROPIX, to ensure they are well equipped to deliver PvSeroRDT's to African communities, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe PvSeroRDT project will contribute a robust POC diagnostic to the pipeline in sub-Saharan Africa. The project is designed to address the World Health Organisation's preferred product characteristic for\nP. vivax\ndiagnosis, to translate from an SME prototype to African-based industrial design, to test clinical performance in several African sites, and to facilitate field deployment. This will ultimately secure healthcare provider access to this novel diagnostic, facilitating implementation of\nP. vivax\nserological testing and treatment - a new intervention for malaria elimination.\nChris Yates, CEO of Abingdon Health plc, commented:\n\"We are delighted to have won this grant award as part of a world-leading group of institutions. We are excited to add Abingdon Health's RDT development and manufacturing scale-up expertise to that of our distinguished group of partners. Working with the Institut Pasteur, FIND, LSHTM, and WEHI gives us a great opportunity to produce rapid tests to aid the management of malaria.\"\nDr Michael White, Director of Research at Institute Pasteur commented:\n\"We are very pleased to partner with Abingdon Health to develop and manufacture a new rapid diagnostic test for Plasmodium vivax malaria that is poised to make an important contribution to malaria elimination efforts.\"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Chris Hand, Executive Chairman of the Company.\nEnquiries\nAbingdon Health plc\nwww.abingdonhealth.com/investors/\nChris Yates,\nChief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nChris Hand,\nExecutive Chairman\nZeus (Sole Broker and Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nChris Fielding / Alexandra Campbell-Harris (Corporate Finance)\nFraser Marshall (Corporate Broking)\nWalbrook PR (Media & Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nabingdon@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nPhillip Marriage\n+44 (0)7867 984 082\nAbout Abingdon Health plc\nAbingdon Health\u00a0is a leading med-tech contract service provider offering its services to an international customer base.\nThe Group's\nCDMO division\noffers lateral flow product development, regulatory support, technology transfer and manufacturing services for customers looking to develop new assays or transfer existing laboratory-based assays to a lateral flow format.\u00a0Abingdon Health's CDMO division has the internal capabilities to take lateral flow project",

The contract is worth a total of US$2million and will be performed throughout calendar year 2025. It will begin this month via an initial purchase order for US$350,000.\nThe FOFH contract is designed to allow the necessary regulatory processes to be completed to allow submission for approval by US FDA and UKCA and CE marking via IVDR. This will enable commercialisation of four lateral flow self-tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis in the USA, UK and EU. All of these STD tests successfully completed technical transfer to manufacture at Abingdon's York site earlier this year. Other STD tests are also in development.\nAbingdon Health will provide clinical trial and performance evaluation study support to allow FOFH to advance these products into clinical trials in H1 2025 with the intention of filing for regulatory submission with the FDA in H2 2025.\nThe performance evaluation studies will be provided by Abingdon Analytical Ltd, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, at its analytical laboratory based in Doncaster, UK.\nChris Yates, CEO of Abingdon Health plc, commented:\n\"We are pleased to announce this contract win, which importantly utilises each limb of our business, including our development, scale-up, manufacturing, regulatory and analytical services, illustrating the breadth of expertise that Abingdon brings to its CDMO customer base. We have worked with FOFH to bring these STD products through technical transfer to this stage of commercialisation. This work brings further value to Abingdon Health via our 17% shareholding in FOFH, which we\npreviously announced\nthrough a service-for-equity arrangement.\"\nThe global sexually transmitted disease testing market is\npredicted to grow\nat a CAGR of ~6% from 2023 to 2035, reaching $145 billion by the end of 2035, up from $95 billion in 2022.

The site will commence operations in October 2024 and is expected to become fully operational in early 2025. This US footprint will enable Abingdon to provide additional CDMO support to its broadening international customer base and be closer to large customers in North America.\nThe USA is the largest medical device market in the world, comprising over 40% of the global medtech market and containing over 6,500 medtech companies1. Abingdon has built a portfolio of valued US customers across its various service solutions and the Board believes there is a timely and significant opportunity to expand its US customer base. A number of potential US customers have requested CDMO services to be delivered / supported from the USA. This is in part linked to a continued drive towards onshoring in the US, but also a prerequisite for projects that form part of US-based tender awards or qualify for US grant funding. The Board believes that the new US site, as well as building the Group's capabilities in the US, will expand the number of possible commercial opportunities available. Circa 30% of Abingdon's revenues in the last financial year were derived from the United States.\nThe Group's newly incorporated wholly owned subsidiary, Abingdon Health USA Inc, will operate from the University Research Park in Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin. Madison and the surrounding area and state have long been regarded a healthcare and life sciences centre in the US. In fact, in July 2024, US Senator Tammy Baldwin announced that Wisconsin was selected as one of 12 national Tech Hub applicants awarded a Phase 2 Implementation Grant under the U.S. Economic Development Administration's (EDA)\u00a0Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs\u00a0(Tech Hubs) program2, to support the state in growing its personalized medicine and biohealth technology industry. In addition, Wisconsin offers Abingdon additional ample opportunities in the veterinary and agricultural sectors, both traditional areas of strength for the Group.\nAs previously disclosed on 8 October 2024 in the Final Results announcement; in order to support the next phase of Abingdon's growth, the Board announced the following management changes:\n-\nDr Chris Hand will move to Executive Chairman and lead Abingdon's operations with immediate effect.\n-\nChris Yates, CEO, will lead Abingdon's USA expansion and global commercial activities in the UK, Europe, US and other territories.\nAbingdon is in the process of recruiting a Chief Financial Officer and will further strengthen its Board by adding an additional independent Non-Executive Director.\nThese hires will bring Abingdon in line with QCA Corporate Governance Code recommendations on Board composition. The Group will update on these new appointments in due course.\nChris Yates, CEO of Abingdon Health plc, commented:\n\"I'm looking forward to driving Abingdon's worldwide commercial activities and, in particular, expanding our customer base in the US, the largest med-tech market globally. Our laboratory site in the US will mean we can offer US customers the opportunity to buy their services in the US; this is a first step for Abingdon to provide a broader CDMO proposition from within the US market. I'd like to thank Chris Hand for his flexibility in moving to an Executive role to support these changes. His experience and expertise will be invaluable in maintaining full business continuity, scaling our operations, and facilitating this expansion into the US.\"\nChris Hand, Executive Chairman of Abingdon Health plc, commented:\n\"Expansion into the USA is a key step in the Group's growth plans, and I am pleased that Chris Yates has accepted the challenge to lead the establishment of Abingdon's US base in Madison, WI; oversee our US operations; and manage our global commercial activities. We have a strong operational team at Abingdon, and I am delighted to take on an expanded executive role to facilitate Chris Yates' ability to focus on our US expansion and global sales growth.\"\nLisa Johnson, CEO of BioForward Wisconsin, commented:\n\"On behalf of the biohealth community in Wisconsin, we welcome Abingdon Health to Madison. Abingdon Health is a leader in lateral flow diagnostic technology with a unique, end-to-end value proposition for its customers. As a publicly-traded UK company with a global presence, their decision to open a US office here in Wisconsin provides yet more evidence of our state's growing stature in\u00a0personalized medicine and biohealth technologies.\u00a0We look forward to Abingdon Health\u00a0complementing and\u00a0strengthening our bioheal",

For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Offer is not part of the Placing.\nThe Company values its retail shareholder base, which has supported the Company alongside institutional investors since IPO in December 2020. Given the support of such shareholders, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide its retail shareholders in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in the Retail Offer. The Company is therefore making the Retail Offer available in the United Kingdom to its Shareholders through the financial intermediaries which will be listed, subject to certain access restrictions, on the following website:\nhttps://www.bookbuild.live/deals/N7N5KQ/authorised-intermediaries\nThe proceeds from the Retail Offer would provide further finance for product development and working capital.\nThe Issue Price is the same as that of the Placing Shares and is equivalent to the mid-market price at closing on 16 August 2024, at 9.75 pence per existing Ordinary Share.\nThe Retail Offer is conditional on the New Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Retail Offer being admitted to trading on the AIM market operated by the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAdmission\n\"). Admission of the New Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Retail Offer is expected to take place on 30th August 2024.\nExpected timetable in relation to the Retail Offer\nRetail Offer opens\n09:00, 19/08/2024\nLatest time and date for commitments under the Retail Offer\n16:30, 28/08/2024\nResults of the Retail Offer announced\n29/08/2024\nAdmission and dealings in New Ordinary Shares issuedpursuant to the Retail Offer commence\n30/08/2024\nAny changes to the expected timetable set out above will be notified by the Company through a Regulatory Information Service.

In order to participate in the Retail Offer, each intermediary must be on-boarded onto the BookBuild platform and agree to the final terms and the retail offer terms and conditions, which regulate, inter alia, the conduct of the Retail Offer on market standard terms and provide for the payment of commission to any intermediary that elects to receive a commission and/or fee (to the extent permitted by the FCA Handbook Rules) from the Retail Offer Coordinator (on behalf of the Company).\nAny expenses incurred by any intermediary are for its own account.

Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

          "content": "A further reply from Paul.   I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

If FOFH test are using PCRD (I think they are), our initial 4 tests (with 3 following) could really be quite disruptive, and lucrative.  And on that we have a few slices of the pie through distribution and manufacturing, as well as our 19% shareholding.  There must be something in this given how deeply ABDX are supporting it. 3) \u00a33m of last years raise was to be spent on product development.  Beyond possibly advancing AppDx I have no idea what that\u2019s gone on. Anyone else? 4) Upfront - it edges closer and closer to an NHS contract (at least IMO).  International potential too. 5) Loop - CE marked, but are we still involved? Results are imminent.  Hopefully we\u2019ll get a better flavour this year about how each product/service segment is performing, details on the LTIP vesting conditions etc.",

The usual terms require the recipient to produce Monthly Management Accounts and to allow the regional fund to attend Board Meetings.  There are often tag-along rights and conditions similar to those deployed by successful development capital companies. Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

Outlook \"The Board anticipates H2 FY26 to be profitable and operating cash flow positive whilst the outturn for the year will depend largely on anticipated continued commercial progress throughout H2.\" More predictions of profit with a warning, jam tomorrow, now how many times have they said that before, not surprising SP going nowhere except down, still BOD are doing fine, again salaries paid by all the  fundraise and doing what they enjoy. BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

Would be very please to see this cycle broken and for that there needs to be profits not just promises of jam tomorrow, too late for just more promises as is borne out in the SP so every new fund raise significantly increases current shareholder dilution.

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

They replied today with \u201c We would expect that the full performance conditions will be published in the Annual Report in due course and, as you'd expect, they are targeted at improving the Company's share price performance. The Company's FY25 are expected to be published later this month, and the Annual Report is usually published a few weeks after that.\u201d Personally I\u2019d expect the full report at the same time as the results, but who am I to argue.",

Nothing for us to get too excited about yet (if indeed one can about what many fear might cause the next pandemic), given there\u2019s been no human to human transmission and symptoms are currently mild for humans.  But as I say, this is something that can change rapidly with mutation. We know we are developing a test with Okos, for which we\u2019d have global distribution rights.  Folium are also developing one (confirmed to me by its CEO), and I\u2019d be surprised if we\u2019re not assisting there. And to give an idea of scale, Wisconsin is now testing between 1000 and 1300 samples of cows milk each week in a lab.  That\u2019s 52-55k tests each year, just on cows, just in Wisconsin, in a non pandemic environment. We are ahead of the curve on this one. https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bird-flu-cases-spiking-rcna235519",

          "content": "And just for info, here we see confirmation that FOFH filed to trademark its name in the US on 12/6/25.  Four things we can glean from the application 1. It suggests to me they are doing this in parallel with reg submissions.  The timing is also just a week or so after Yates was confirmed as a Director, so it seems likely the transition from an LLC to an Inc occurred in June, allowing Yates to become a Director, allowing a clean trademark application and, more notably, giving a cleaner structure for investors (because they could buy shares rather than members interests).  And in that respect, I think it reasonable to think Yates likely sold ABDX stock to put him in funds to join in with that investment. 2.The application lists a number of STD\u2019s, beyond the four detailed in announcements.  So it gives a good flavour about what the other 3 are likely to be. 3 It talks about tests having embedded operating software.  Your guess is as good as mine, but I\u2019m assuming that means the tests are linked in with AppDx. 4.Interestingly, the submission also references tests \u201c in the fields of cancer or other tissue-based diagnostic testing, cytology and cell-based testing.\u201d  That perhaps suggests FOFH has longer term objectives beyond just STD testing. The application doesn\u2019t yet appear to have been allocated to an examiner.  I doubt the shutdown will help move things along! https://trademarks.justia.com/992/31/find-out-from-99231876.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com Lastly, I registered with Justia so I could see the FOFH address - it\u2019s 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808 United States.  That corresponds with the  Delaware company register for Find Out From Home Inc, registered in Sept 2023.",

There are some real positives at the moment which indicate the growth push is delivering, and still some things bubbling like; 1) EcoFlo - surely we should get some idea about commercial take up at some point soon. 2  FOFH - as far as I can see there are very few STD self tests approved in the US and only one using Molecular tech (and even that\u2019s just for women).  If FOFH test are using PCRD (I think they are), our initial 4 tests (with 3 following) could really be quite disruptive, and lucrative.  And on that we have a few slices of the pie through distribution and manufacturing, as well as our 19% shareholding.  There must be something in this given how deeply ABDX are supporting it. 3) \u00a33m of last years raise was to be spent on product development.  Beyond possibly advancing AppDx I have no idea what that\u2019s gone on. Anyone else? 4) Upfront - it edges closer and closer to an NHS contract (at least IMO).  International potential too. 5) Loop - CE marked, but are we still involved? Results are imminent.  Hopefully we\u2019ll get a better flavour this year about how each product/service segment is performing, details on the LTIP vesting conditions etc.",

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

The usual terms require the recipient to produce Monthly Management Accounts and to allow the regional fund to attend Board Meetings.  There are often tag-along rights and conditions similar to those deployed by successful development capital companies. Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

They are great at spending cash on themselves and the company but seem to not know or care how to make a profit, they may be very bight in their own fields but fail to grasp this situation cannot go on indefinably.",

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

There are often tag-along rights and conditions similar to those deployed by successful development capital companies. Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

Since launching in February 2025, the PvSeroRDT Consortium has been busy building momentum within their respective work packages through early engagement of key stakeholders and partners, initiation of research activities, and execution of agreements to enable the sharing and production of materials required for the project. We are particularly excited to celebrate the advances made within Work Package 4 led by Abingdon Health plc, which focuses on research and development (R&D) into the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Having successfully completed the feasibility phase, we can now share that the RDT test concept works! The technology will now be moving forward in Optimisation, with preparation underway for manufacturing and further refinement. A list of key R&D milestones completed is shared in the slides below.

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

The usual terms require the recipient to produce Monthly Management Accounts and to allow the regional fund to attend Board Meetings.  There are often tag-along rights and conditions similar to those deployed by successful development capital companies. Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

Since launching in February 2025, the PvSeroRDT Consortium has been busy building momentum within their respective work packages through early engagement of key stakeholders and partners, initiation of research activities, and execution of agreements to enable the sharing and production of materials required for the project. We are particularly excited to celebrate the advances made within Work Package 4 led by Abingdon Health plc, which focuses on research and development (R&D) into the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Having successfully completed the feasibility phase, we can now share that the RDT test concept works! The technology will now be moving forward in Optimisation, with preparation underway for manufacturing and further refinement. A list of key R&D milestones completed is shared in the slides below.

They are great at spending cash on themselves and the company but seem to not know or care how to make a profit, they may be very bight in their own fields but fail to grasp this situation cannot go on indefinably.",

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

And overheads increased because of expansion costs. I think we need about \u00a312m to \u00a312.5m to breakeven.  That seems very achievable to me given the US footprint and the significant contracts it\u2019s helping to win us.",

Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

Since launching in February 2025, the PvSeroRDT Consortium has been busy building momentum within their respective work packages through early engagement of key stakeholders and partners, initiation of research activities, and execution of agreements to enable the sharing and production of materials required for the project. We are particularly excited to celebrate the advances made within Work Package 4 led by Abingdon Health plc, which focuses on research and development (R&D) into the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Having successfully completed the feasibility phase, we can now share that the RDT test concept works! The technology will now be moving forward in Optimisation, with preparation underway for manufacturing and further refinement. A list of key R&D milestones completed is shared in the slides below.

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

The usual terms require the recipient to produce Monthly Management Accounts and to allow the regional fund to attend Board Meetings.  There are often tag-along rights and conditions similar to those deployed by successful development capital companies. Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

Outlook \"The Board anticipates H2 FY26 to be profitable and operating cash flow positive whilst the outturn for the year will depend largely on anticipated continued commercial progress throughout H2.\" More predictions of profit with a warning, jam tomorrow, now how many times have they said that before, not surprising SP going nowhere except down, still BOD are doing fine, again salaries paid by all the  fundraise and doing what they enjoy. BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",

Since launching in February 2025, the PvSeroRDT Consortium has been busy building momentum within their respective work packages through early engagement of key stakeholders and partners, initiation of research activities, and execution of agreements to enable the sharing and production of materials required for the project. We are particularly excited to celebrate the advances made within Work Package 4 led by Abingdon Health plc, which focuses on research and development (R&D) into the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Having successfully completed the feasibility phase, we can now share that the RDT test concept works! The technology will now be moving forward in Optimisation, with preparation underway for manufacturing and further refinement. A list of key R&D milestones completed is shared in the slides below.

I was unaware a new Zeus broker notes issued today was issued this morning. \u201cAs I said, this is something they intend to raise with their Board colleagues, so let's see. On today's call the Company referred to the current market forecasts - not old broker notes issued months and months ago. The Zeus note was issued this morning and represents the current market expectations. These will be aligned with the guidance from the Company, so you would not expect them to be materially different from the management's own expectations, and should there be a change in the Company's performance or expectation of its performance then they would issue an announcement to change that guidance. If you are not aware the market forecasts are for revenues of \u00a312.2m next year (FY26) and breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA level, and \u00a315.1m revenues for FY27, and an adj. EBITDA of \u00a31.1m. I'm not sure of whether Zeus have restrictions on who can view their research but you can always contact them via their research portal and see if you can view their research - usually retail customers has to sign a waiver to say that they would seek professional, independent advice before investing as their research is intended for institutional investors only. You can certainly contact them and see: https://zeuscapital.co.uk/log-in/research-portal-login/#/portal/zeus-capital There is no refusal to give guidance on forecasts - these are found in the regularly updated and current broker notes, that set the market expectations. We expect to update our own Walbrook 2 page summary for Abingdon post the results and will make sure you're sent this as it will contain the market forecasts.\u201c",

Both emails below \u201cHi Paul Please pass on my thanks to the ABDX board for doing the results presentation today. In your email below you say you would expect the full LTIP performance conditions will be published in the annual report, yet today Mr Hand refused to commit to that when asked. Please confirm that they WILL be fully disclosed.  If not, please explain why not given the repeated confirmation that they align with shareholder interests. Many thanks\u201c His reply \u201c Thanks for your email Mark, Yes, that was my original understanding and what I had been guided to previously, and that guidance was contradicted in today's IMC. You will note on the call that I did specifically pass on the feedback from investors for transparency in relation to the criteria for the LTIP.  This is something they will raise with their Board colleagues on the remuneration committee. Kind regards, Paul \u201d",

The usual terms require the recipient to produce Monthly Management Accounts and to allow the regional fund to attend Board Meetings.  There are often tag-along rights and conditions similar to those deployed by successful development capital companies. Without any doubt, NPIF's involvement will strengthen the discipline within this promising enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. Well done Cannacord & the Board in taking this important step. A refreshing change from many more problematic enterprises on AIM where placings, too often, serve to benefit new investors, directors and advisers. Am very content to be an investor.",

BOD don't care, if no profit before they burn thought the current cash just need another fund raise to keep them in the lifestyle they believe they are entitled to, no problem shareholders just get diluted and take another hit on the SP just like they have many times over the past few years.",
