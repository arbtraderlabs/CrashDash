The agreement contemplated a phased approach to engagement, enabling Lost Soldier to evaluate Upland's targeted assets and participate through structured transactions aligned with specific assets and work programmes.\nThe Framework Agreement also provided for\ncloser technical and operational collaboration\n, including cooperation on subsurface evaluation, drilling execution and development planning, and established the foundations for future\nfarm-in and funding arrangements\nto be progressed on a project-by-project basis\n.\nThe current Letter of Commitment reflects the continued development of this relationship and represents a further step in translating the Framework Agreement into\npractical, project-aligned funding support\nfor Upland's targeted Southeast Asian portfolio.\nhttps://upland.energy/media/\nResource Potential and Development Strategy\nThis partnership materially enhances Upland's technical maturity, operational depth, and financial agility, enabling multiple regional workstreams to progress in parallel - a key differentiator for an emerging upstream operator.\nResource Scale\nUpland in partnership with Lost Soldier, is assessing and targeting in excess of\n5 billion barrels of oil equivalent (\"boe\")\nof gross unrisked prospective resources and 2C contingent resources, based on internal technical evaluations and third-party data where available.\nDevelopment Programme\nThe parties envisage an initial\nmulti-year\nexploration and appraisal programme of up to\nten wells\n,\n(10)\nto be phased in line with regulatory approvals, subsurface results and prudent capital allocation.\nSector Outlook\nGrowing recognition of the potential for unconventional oil and gas resources in under-explored Southeast Asian basins, combined with improved fiscal terms and strong regional demand, provides a favourable environment for Upland and Lost Soldier to apply proven unconventional expertise, while also targeting stacked conventional plays that sit above these unconventional horizons.\nOperational Readiness and Execution Capability\nAs part of the strategic cooperation agreement, provision is being made by the parties for the securing of an\nonshore drilling rig\nto support the planned exploration and appraisal programme.\nIt is envisaged that such a rig would be operated under\nUpland Borneo Drilling Services\n, providing operational control, scheduling flexibility and potential cost efficiencies for the joint work programme.\nPlease see the link below outlining some of the Group capabilities\nhttps://upland.energy/drilling-services/\nStrategic Rationale\nUpland continues to pursue a\ndisciplined strategy to build a scalable and material upstream portfolio in Southeast Asia\n, underpinned by technical capability, regional presence and access to capital.\nThe partnership with Lost Soldier provides:\n\u25cf\nAccess to substantial medium-term project funding capacity\n\u25cf\nA clear and structured pathway to advance assets\nfrom exploration through appraisal and into development\n\u25cf\nAlignment with a technically capable and well-capitalised strategic partner\n\u25cf\nEnhanced execution capability through integrated midstream and drilling infrastructure, reflecting Lost Soldier's ownership of a pipeline company and onshore drilling rigs, supporting improved cost control, scheduling certainty and operational efficiency\n\u25cf\nDeep technical expertise in unconventional drilling into complex geological settings\nManagement Commentary\nBolhassan Di, Chairman and CEO of Upland Resources Ltd, commented:\n\"This strategic cooperation with Lost Soldier represents an important milestone for Upland as we continue to build a material, scalable upstream position in Southeast Asia.
