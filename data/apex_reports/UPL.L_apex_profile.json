It has\nanalogous geological configuration and reservoir/trap/seal combinations as the Brunei's nearby Belait formation which is host to a number of proven oil and gas discoveries and oilfields such as the billion barrel Seria and Champion fields.\n\u00b7\nAll parts of the Belait structure connect with potential oil kitchens on both flanks in the Badas and Belait synclines. Hence, Upland's SK344 block being immediately adjacent to the Belait syncline is determined to have attractive prospectivity.\n\u00b7\nTwo technical studies have been conducted on SK334. The first was commissioned by Upland and Brooke Dockyard & Engineering as part of the PETRONAS 2018 Bid round. The second, a joint technical study (JTS) undertaken by Upland and PETROS - the Sarawak state energy company.\nDuring the course of the JTS, PETROS provided 2D seismic data, airborne gravity (FTG) and magnetic data, various technical and analogue well reports. These were\ninterpreted and integrated with data from field studies.\n\u00b7\nAlbeit there are small differences both studies confirm the prospectivity of SK334 and in particular the initial target sites for exploration and appraisal drilling.\n\u00b7\nEach of the studies has shown strong correlation between seismic interpretation and the surface geology.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, several oil and gas seepages were\nrecorded at the delineated prospective areas. Hyd\nrocarbon micro-seepage studies conducted previously have also confirmed the presence of active petroleum systems in the area.\n\u00b7\nBoth studies and field work conducted show a first estimate of exploration risk as medium to low.\n\u00b7\nThree geological structures have been identified by Upland for initial exploration drilling locations - A (depth 1100-1500 m), B (depth 1000-1500 m), C (depth 1900-2400 m).\n\u00b7\nStructure B, which Upland has named Santubong, will be the first site to be drilled.\n\u00b7\nThe three structures, combined have yet-to-find unrisked median hydrocarbon resources that are in the same range as those in the Seria and Champion fields. The hydrocarbon type are expected to be oil prone but may still have a significant amount of gas.\n\u00b7\nUpland intends to conduct a Competent Persons Report (CPR) in the near term.\n\u00b7\nTo date, only preliminary investigations have been made for other parts of SK334 - the Lawas area. The lead area in Lawas may be in the North-West section closest to the shoreline where Full Tensor Gradiometry data interpretation indicates the strongest reading.\nBolhassan Di, Upland Chairman and CEO commented:\n\"Preliminary resource estimates from the studies that Upland have conducted have been positive, exceeding our expectations.\nOur strategy is to progressively confirm the resources available in SK334. That of course means a campaign of exploration and appraisal drilling to improve our geological understanding, and to calibrate geophysical and drill engineering plans.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nUpland Resources Limited\nBolhassan Di\nChairman and CEO\nGerry Murray COO\nAlbert May CCO\nTel: +60 198 861919\nbolhassan@uplandbigoil.com.my\ngerry.murray@upland.energy\nalbert.may@upland.energy\nwww.upland.energy\nOptiva Securities -\nJoint\nBroker\nVishal Balasingham\nTel: +44 (0)20 3137 1903\nvishal.balasingham\n@optivasecurities.com\nwww.optivasecurities.com\nOAK Securities -\nJoint\nBroker\nJerry Keen\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nTel: +44 (0)20 3973 3678\nj\nerry.keen@oak-securities.com\nh\nenry.clarke@oak-securities.com\ndillon.anadkat@oak-securities.com\nwww.oak-securities.com\n**ENDS**\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Can you do me the favour of keeping it civil, I get more than enough childish bickering over on the EUA chat (no I don't want to talk about what a stinker my investment the is). To the point that it's nigh on unreadable. Thoughtful discourse is always to be encouraged but some of this is stupid. I get it we all have different hopes, estimates of time frames & schedules based on our own interpretations of the knowledge publicly available. Thus far Stanley has been largely correct in his opinions, I think we can all see the positive trend going on here & with the options that may become available alongside the increasing ability to facilitate them I think we've got a strong investment. If we do indeed (I believe we had applied for 3 separately but may be wrong) land an Indonesian block for near future drilling then I'd expect to see the SP rise to a conservative 7-8pps either way I'm in the green on this one so happy to wait. Hope all of us achieve our expectations from our investments in UPL.",

Marc Bruner is not a name-plate advisor. He\u2019s a proven builder of multi-billion-dollar energy companies, with exits and valuations that dwarf Upland\u2019s current market cap. The key point: with the shares at 3p, Bruner has taken options at 5p. That means he only wins if shareholders win \u2014 and only if Upland delivers a material rerating. This is strong alignment: 5p options are ~67% out of the money No upside unless Upland breaks decisively above current levels Incentivised to drive real value-unlocking events (farm-outs, asset monetisation, strategic deals), not endless dilution Add to that: His deep experience in large-scale gas discoveries Direct involvement in Lost Soldier, where Upland already has exposure A 6% indirect shareholding reinforcing long-term commitment The signal is clear: A highly credible upstream veteran believes Upland can be worth meaningfully more than today \u2014 and is willing to tie his personal upside to that outcome. This doesn\u2019t reprice the stock overnight, but it materially increases the probability of a step-change outcome. When execution news lands, this RNS will be remembered as the moment Upland quietly upgraded from a speculative story to a serious value-creation play",

Can you do me the favour of keeping it civil, I get more than enough childish bickering over on the EUA chat (no I don't want to talk about what a stinker my investment the is). To the point that it's nigh on unreadable. Thoughtful discourse is always to be encouraged but some of this is stupid. I get it we all have different hopes, estimates of time frames & schedules based on our own interpretations of the knowledge publicly available. Thus far Stanley has been largely correct in his opinions, I think we can all see the positive trend going on here & with the options that may become available alongside the increasing ability to facilitate them I think we've got a strong investment. If we do indeed (I believe we had applied for 3 separately but may be wrong) land an Indonesian block for near future drilling then I'd expect to see the SP rise to a conservative 7-8pps either way I'm in the green on this one so happy to wait. Hope all of us achieve our expectations from our investments in UPL.",

I know you haven\u2019t named anyone but I\u2019d rather anyone even vaguely \u2018in the know\u2019 would keep schtum. Today\u2019s tweet was huge I thought. And I believe that UPL would not have posted that if huge announcements weren\u2019t on the horizon. It was a big and bold statement: \u201cA Transformational 2026\u201d. I\u2019m utterly confident but I don\u2019t feel the need to chip away at the company\u2019s decision to (in the main) not disclose anything until the time is right.",

Can you do me the favour of keeping it civil, I get more than enough childish bickering over on the EUA chat (no I don't want to talk about what a stinker my investment the is). To the point that it's nigh on unreadable. Thoughtful discourse is always to be encouraged but some of this is stupid. I get it we all have different hopes, estimates of time frames & schedules based on our own interpretations of the knowledge publicly available. Thus far Stanley has been largely correct in his opinions, I think we can all see the positive trend going on here & with the options that may become available alongside the increasing ability to facilitate them I think we've got a strong investment. If we do indeed (I believe we had applied for 3 separately but may be wrong) land an Indonesian block for near future drilling then I'd expect to see the SP rise to a conservative 7-8pps either way I'm in the green on this one so happy to wait. Hope all of us achieve our expectations from our investments in UPL.",

Its good that you're probing though... going deeper in your research than most punters that just chase noise Alright, oil & gas resources 101\u2014this is a good question and one a lot of people mix up. ### What are **2C Contingent Resources**? **2C** is the *best estimate* (or \u201cmost likely\u201d) volume within **Contingent Resources** under the PRMS (Petroleum Resources Management System). Contingent Resources are: * **Discovered** hydrocarbons (there\u2019s been a well, test, or solid evidence) * **Not yet commercial** because of *contingencies* like: * No development plan yet * Economics not approved * Regulatory or fiscal uncertainty * Missing infrastructure * Pending technology or market access Think of **2C** as: > \u201cWe know the hydrocarbons are there, and this is our most realistic volume \u2014 we just haven\u2019t cleared all the business or technical hurdles yet.\u201d --- ### What are **Prospective Resources**? Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",

Key Case: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner (Colorado, 2022) This case involved a dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers connected to Australian exploration projects. Bruner, alleged to be Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, was accused (along with others) of manipulating corporate control to exclude investors from profits. Procedural Focus, Not Liability An earlier federal lawsuit (2017) alleging fraud and racketeering was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was underway in Australia. In 2022, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that this dismissal did not bar the case from proceeding in Colorado, since it was not a decision on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. No Substantive Finding Against Bruner The appellate decision addressed where the case could be heard, not whether Bruner was liable. Other Related Litigation In Brody v. Bruner (Tenth Circuit), Bruner appeared in connection with PetroHunter, an energy company, in a bankruptcy-related dispute. The court affirmed dismissal of civil conspiracy claims. Bottom line: Bruner has been involved in oil and gas\u2013related litigation primarily over investment control and corporate governance, with rulings focused on procedural issues, not determinations of fraud or liability.",

Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner \u2014 Oil & Gas Investment Dispute (Colorado) This is the key case involving oil and gas business litigation where Marc Bruner was a defendant: Case Overview Name: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner Court: Colorado Court of Appeals (Colorado, USA) Decision: July 14, 2022 Defendants: Marc Bruner and Michael Caetano Plaintiff: Nation SLP, LLC Core Issue: Dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers about control of profits and corporate governance in Australian oil and gas exploration entities. \ufffd Colorado Lawyer +1 Background The dispute stemmed from investors and related companies formed around exploration permits for oil and gas properties in Australia. Investors created entities like Nation SLP, Paltar Petroleum, and Nation Energy to fund and operate projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Bruner was alleged to have served as Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, with Caetano holding key executive roles in Nation Energy and Nation Australia. The plaintiffs claimed that Bruner and Caetano manipulated boards and company decisions to cut investors out of their share of profits from the exploration projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Lawsuit History Earlier Federal Case (2017): Plaintiffs filed a suit in U.S. District Court (Colorado) alleging fraud, racketeering, and breaches of fiduciary duty involving Bruner and others. That case was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was pending in Australia, and Australian law governed many claims. \ufffd law.justia.com Colorado Court of Appeals (2022): In Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner, the Colorado appeals court held that the earlier dismissal for forum non conveniens did not bar the present Colorado lawsuit under \u201cres judicata\u201d (claim preclusion) because dismissals on those grounds are not judgments on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings in Colorado. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83d\udccc Key point: This lawsuit involves Bruner in the context of oil and gas investment and corporate control disputes, but it was not a verdict or finding of liability against him \u2014 rather, it focused on procedural issues about where the case could properly be heard. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83e\uddfe Additional Litigation Not Directly About Oil, But Related to Bruner in Energy Context Brody v.

Gas expertise (Lost Soldier). Upland Borneo Drilling Services (regional hub and oil experts). Local Sarawak contractors. First ever UK company to partner Petros. Huge BoD experience in Sarawak and Brunei. That's just a few hightlights.  HOWEVER, the key missing ingredient is one of the licences we are looking for (Brunei / Sarawak / Indonesia).  If the BoD get them across the line, this goes absolutely mental.  If they don't, I'll see you in Aldi for home brand beans and cardboard toast! Yes, it's high risk/high reward...BUT the difference this time is that we have a revenue share with Lost Soldier.  First gas this year (maybe even Q3, if not Q4).

Its good that you're probing though... going deeper in your research than most punters that just chase noise Alright, oil & gas resources 101\u2014this is a good question and one a lot of people mix up. ### What are **2C Contingent Resources**? **2C** is the *best estimate* (or \u201cmost likely\u201d) volume within **Contingent Resources** under the PRMS (Petroleum Resources Management System). Contingent Resources are: * **Discovered** hydrocarbons (there\u2019s been a well, test, or solid evidence) * **Not yet commercial** because of *contingencies* like: * No development plan yet * Economics not approved * Regulatory or fiscal uncertainty * Missing infrastructure * Pending technology or market access Think of **2C** as: > \u201cWe know the hydrocarbons are there, and this is our most realistic volume \u2014 we just haven\u2019t cleared all the business or technical hurdles yet.\u201d --- ### What are **Prospective Resources**? Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",

Key Case: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner (Colorado, 2022) This case involved a dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers connected to Australian exploration projects. Bruner, alleged to be Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, was accused (along with others) of manipulating corporate control to exclude investors from profits. Procedural Focus, Not Liability An earlier federal lawsuit (2017) alleging fraud and racketeering was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was underway in Australia. In 2022, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that this dismissal did not bar the case from proceeding in Colorado, since it was not a decision on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. No Substantive Finding Against Bruner The appellate decision addressed where the case could be heard, not whether Bruner was liable. Other Related Litigation In Brody v. Bruner (Tenth Circuit), Bruner appeared in connection with PetroHunter, an energy company, in a bankruptcy-related dispute. The court affirmed dismissal of civil conspiracy claims. Bottom line: Bruner has been involved in oil and gas\u2013related litigation primarily over investment control and corporate governance, with rulings focused on procedural issues, not determinations of fraud or liability.",

Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner \u2014 Oil & Gas Investment Dispute (Colorado) This is the key case involving oil and gas business litigation where Marc Bruner was a defendant: Case Overview Name: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner Court: Colorado Court of Appeals (Colorado, USA) Decision: July 14, 2022 Defendants: Marc Bruner and Michael Caetano Plaintiff: Nation SLP, LLC Core Issue: Dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers about control of profits and corporate governance in Australian oil and gas exploration entities. \ufffd Colorado Lawyer +1 Background The dispute stemmed from investors and related companies formed around exploration permits for oil and gas properties in Australia. Investors created entities like Nation SLP, Paltar Petroleum, and Nation Energy to fund and operate projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Bruner was alleged to have served as Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, with Caetano holding key executive roles in Nation Energy and Nation Australia. The plaintiffs claimed that Bruner and Caetano manipulated boards and company decisions to cut investors out of their share of profits from the exploration projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Lawsuit History Earlier Federal Case (2017): Plaintiffs filed a suit in U.S. District Court (Colorado) alleging fraud, racketeering, and breaches of fiduciary duty involving Bruner and others. That case was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was pending in Australia, and Australian law governed many claims. \ufffd law.justia.com Colorado Court of Appeals (2022): In Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner, the Colorado appeals court held that the earlier dismissal for forum non conveniens did not bar the present Colorado lawsuit under \u201cres judicata\u201d (claim preclusion) because dismissals on those grounds are not judgments on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings in Colorado. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83d\udccc Key point: This lawsuit involves Bruner in the context of oil and gas investment and corporate control disputes, but it was not a verdict or finding of liability against him \u2014 rather, it focused on procedural issues about where the case could properly be heard. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83e\uddfe Additional Litigation Not Directly About Oil, But Related to Bruner in Energy Context Brody v.

Gas expertise (Lost Soldier). Upland Borneo Drilling Services (regional hub and oil experts). Local Sarawak contractors. First ever UK company to partner Petros. Huge BoD experience in Sarawak and Brunei. That's just a few hightlights.  HOWEVER, the key missing ingredient is one of the licences we are looking for (Brunei / Sarawak / Indonesia).  If the BoD get them across the line, this goes absolutely mental.  If they don't, I'll see you in Aldi for home brand beans and cardboard toast! Yes, it's high risk/high reward...BUT the difference this time is that we have a revenue share with Lost Soldier.  First gas this year (maybe even Q3, if not Q4).

Its good that you're probing though... going deeper in your research than most punters that just chase noise Alright, oil & gas resources 101\u2014this is a good question and one a lot of people mix up. ### What are **2C Contingent Resources**? **2C** is the *best estimate* (or \u201cmost likely\u201d) volume within **Contingent Resources** under the PRMS (Petroleum Resources Management System). Contingent Resources are: * **Discovered** hydrocarbons (there\u2019s been a well, test, or solid evidence) * **Not yet commercial** because of *contingencies* like: * No development plan yet * Economics not approved * Regulatory or fiscal uncertainty * Missing infrastructure * Pending technology or market access Think of **2C** as: > \u201cWe know the hydrocarbons are there, and this is our most realistic volume \u2014 we just haven\u2019t cleared all the business or technical hurdles yet.\u201d --- ### What are **Prospective Resources**? Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",

          "content": "Summary Publicly documented litigation involving Marc Bruner in the oil and gas sector centers mainly on an investment and corporate governance dispute, not a finding of wrongdoing. Key Case: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner (Colorado, 2022) This case involved a dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers connected to Australian exploration projects. Bruner, alleged to be Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, was accused (along with others) of manipulating corporate control to exclude investors from profits. Procedural Focus, Not Liability An earlier federal lawsuit (2017) alleging fraud and racketeering was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was underway in Australia. In 2022, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that this dismissal did not bar the case from proceeding in Colorado, since it was not a decision on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. No Substantive Finding Against Bruner The appellate decision addressed where the case could be heard, not whether Bruner was liable. Other Related Litigation In Brody v. Bruner (Tenth Circuit), Bruner appeared in connection with PetroHunter, an energy company, in a bankruptcy-related dispute. The court affirmed dismissal of civil conspiracy claims. Bottom line: Bruner has been involved in oil and gas\u2013related litigation primarily over investment control and corporate governance, with rulings focused on procedural issues, not determinations of fraud or liability.",

Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner \u2014 Oil & Gas Investment Dispute (Colorado) This is the key case involving oil and gas business litigation where Marc Bruner was a defendant: Case Overview Name: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner Court: Colorado Court of Appeals (Colorado, USA) Decision: July 14, 2022 Defendants: Marc Bruner and Michael Caetano Plaintiff: Nation SLP, LLC Core Issue: Dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers about control of profits and corporate governance in Australian oil and gas exploration entities. \ufffd Colorado Lawyer +1 Background The dispute stemmed from investors and related companies formed around exploration permits for oil and gas properties in Australia. Investors created entities like Nation SLP, Paltar Petroleum, and Nation Energy to fund and operate projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Bruner was alleged to have served as Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, with Caetano holding key executive roles in Nation Energy and Nation Australia. The plaintiffs claimed that Bruner and Caetano manipulated boards and company decisions to cut investors out of their share of profits from the exploration projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Lawsuit History Earlier Federal Case (2017): Plaintiffs filed a suit in U.S. District Court (Colorado) alleging fraud, racketeering, and breaches of fiduciary duty involving Bruner and others. That case was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was pending in Australia, and Australian law governed many claims. \ufffd law.justia.com Colorado Court of Appeals (2022): In Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner, the Colorado appeals court held that the earlier dismissal for forum non conveniens did not bar the present Colorado lawsuit under \u201cres judicata\u201d (claim preclusion) because dismissals on those grounds are not judgments on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings in Colorado. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83d\udccc Key point: This lawsuit involves Bruner in the context of oil and gas investment and corporate control disputes, but it was not a verdict or finding of liability against him \u2014 rather, it focused on procedural issues about where the case could properly be heard. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83e\uddfe Additional Litigation Not Directly About Oil, But Related to Bruner in Energy Context Brody v. Bruner \u2014 Bankruptcy & PetroHunter (Energy Sector) There is a Brody v. Bruner case in the U.S. Tenth Circuit involving Marc A.

The $100m financing secured is enough to drill 10 prospects meaning 2 or 3 a year over the next 4 years. Going to be an extremely exciting ride for shareholders. Only needs one of these 10 to come in and we will be looking at 500m-1b Mcao here! Not sure the market has cottoned on yet. I guess the final jigsaw piece will be PSC landing... one would think they've been lining up the ducks. No point in announcing financing and teaming up with Marc Bruner if there is nothing to drill yet....",

Its good that you're probing though... going deeper in your research than most punters that just chase noise Alright, oil & gas resources 101\u2014this is a good question and one a lot of people mix up. ### What are **2C Contingent Resources**? **2C** is the *best estimate* (or \u201cmost likely\u201d) volume within **Contingent Resources** under the PRMS (Petroleum Resources Management System). Contingent Resources are: * **Discovered** hydrocarbons (there\u2019s been a well, test, or solid evidence) * **Not yet commercial** because of *contingencies* like: * No development plan yet * Economics not approved * Regulatory or fiscal uncertainty * Missing infrastructure * Pending technology or market access Think of **2C** as: > \u201cWe know the hydrocarbons are there, and this is our most realistic volume \u2014 we just haven\u2019t cleared all the business or technical hurdles yet.\u201d --- ### What are **Prospective Resources**? Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",

Key Case: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner (Colorado, 2022) This case involved a dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers connected to Australian exploration projects. Bruner, alleged to be Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, was accused (along with others) of manipulating corporate control to exclude investors from profits. Procedural Focus, Not Liability An earlier federal lawsuit (2017) alleging fraud and racketeering was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was underway in Australia. In 2022, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that this dismissal did not bar the case from proceeding in Colorado, since it was not a decision on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. No Substantive Finding Against Bruner The appellate decision addressed where the case could be heard, not whether Bruner was liable. Other Related Litigation In Brody v. Bruner (Tenth Circuit), Bruner appeared in connection with PetroHunter, an energy company, in a bankruptcy-related dispute. The court affirmed dismissal of civil conspiracy claims. Bottom line: Bruner has been involved in oil and gas\u2013related litigation primarily over investment control and corporate governance, with rulings focused on procedural issues, not determinations of fraud or liability.",

Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner \u2014 Oil & Gas Investment Dispute (Colorado) This is the key case involving oil and gas business litigation where Marc Bruner was a defendant: Case Overview Name: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner Court: Colorado Court of Appeals (Colorado, USA) Decision: July 14, 2022 Defendants: Marc Bruner and Michael Caetano Plaintiff: Nation SLP, LLC Core Issue: Dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers about control of profits and corporate governance in Australian oil and gas exploration entities. \ufffd Colorado Lawyer +1 Background The dispute stemmed from investors and related companies formed around exploration permits for oil and gas properties in Australia. Investors created entities like Nation SLP, Paltar Petroleum, and Nation Energy to fund and operate projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Bruner was alleged to have served as Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, with Caetano holding key executive roles in Nation Energy and Nation Australia. The plaintiffs claimed that Bruner and Caetano manipulated boards and company decisions to cut investors out of their share of profits from the exploration projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Lawsuit History Earlier Federal Case (2017): Plaintiffs filed a suit in U.S. District Court (Colorado) alleging fraud, racketeering, and breaches of fiduciary duty involving Bruner and others. That case was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was pending in Australia, and Australian law governed many claims. \ufffd law.justia.com Colorado Court of Appeals (2022): In Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner, the Colorado appeals court held that the earlier dismissal for forum non conveniens did not bar the present Colorado lawsuit under \u201cres judicata\u201d (claim preclusion) because dismissals on those grounds are not judgments on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings in Colorado. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83d\udccc Key point: This lawsuit involves Bruner in the context of oil and gas investment and corporate control disputes, but it was not a verdict or finding of liability against him \u2014 rather, it focused on procedural issues about where the case could properly be heard. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83e\uddfe Additional Litigation Not Directly About Oil, But Related to Bruner in Energy Context Brody v.

Gas expertise (Lost Soldier). Upland Borneo Drilling Services (regional hub and oil experts). Local Sarawak contractors. First ever UK company to partner Petros. Huge BoD experience in Sarawak and Brunei. That's just a few hightlights.  HOWEVER, the key missing ingredient is one of the licences we are looking for (Brunei / Sarawak / Indonesia).  If the BoD get them across the line, this goes absolutely mental.  If they don't, I'll see you in Aldi for home brand beans and cardboard toast! Yes, it's high risk/high reward...BUT the difference this time is that we have a revenue share with Lost Soldier.  First gas this year (maybe even Q3, if not Q4).  With monthly income, if feels the game is changing (in a good way!)",

Its good that you're probing though... going deeper in your research than most punters that just chase noise Alright, oil & gas resources 101\u2014this is a good question and one a lot of people mix up. ### What are **2C Contingent Resources**? **2C** is the *best estimate* (or \u201cmost likely\u201d) volume within **Contingent Resources** under the PRMS (Petroleum Resources Management System). Contingent Resources are: * **Discovered** hydrocarbons (there\u2019s been a well, test, or solid evidence) * **Not yet commercial** because of *contingencies* like: * No development plan yet * Economics not approved * Regulatory or fiscal uncertainty * Missing infrastructure * Pending technology or market access Think of **2C** as: > \u201cWe know the hydrocarbons are there, and this is our most realistic volume \u2014 we just haven\u2019t cleared all the business or technical hurdles yet.\u201d --- ### What are **Prospective Resources**? Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",

Key Case: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner (Colorado, 2022) This case involved a dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers connected to Australian exploration projects. Bruner, alleged to be Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, was accused (along with others) of manipulating corporate control to exclude investors from profits. Procedural Focus, Not Liability An earlier federal lawsuit (2017) alleging fraud and racketeering was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was underway in Australia. In 2022, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that this dismissal did not bar the case from proceeding in Colorado, since it was not a decision on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. No Substantive Finding Against Bruner The appellate decision addressed where the case could be heard, not whether Bruner was liable. Other Related Litigation In Brody v. Bruner (Tenth Circuit), Bruner appeared in connection with PetroHunter, an energy company, in a bankruptcy-related dispute. The court affirmed dismissal of civil conspiracy claims. Bottom line: Bruner has been involved in oil and gas\u2013related litigation primarily over investment control and corporate governance, with rulings focused on procedural issues, not determinations of fraud or liability.",

Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner \u2014 Oil & Gas Investment Dispute (Colorado) This is the key case involving oil and gas business litigation where Marc Bruner was a defendant: Case Overview Name: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner Court: Colorado Court of Appeals (Colorado, USA) Decision: July 14, 2022 Defendants: Marc Bruner and Michael Caetano Plaintiff: Nation SLP, LLC Core Issue: Dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers about control of profits and corporate governance in Australian oil and gas exploration entities. \ufffd Colorado Lawyer +1 Background The dispute stemmed from investors and related companies formed around exploration permits for oil and gas properties in Australia. Investors created entities like Nation SLP, Paltar Petroleum, and Nation Energy to fund and operate projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Bruner was alleged to have served as Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, with Caetano holding key executive roles in Nation Energy and Nation Australia. The plaintiffs claimed that Bruner and Caetano manipulated boards and company decisions to cut investors out of their share of profits from the exploration projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Lawsuit History Earlier Federal Case (2017): Plaintiffs filed a suit in U.S. District Court (Colorado) alleging fraud, racketeering, and breaches of fiduciary duty involving Bruner and others. That case was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was pending in Australia, and Australian law governed many claims. \ufffd law.justia.com Colorado Court of Appeals (2022): In Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner, the Colorado appeals court held that the earlier dismissal for forum non conveniens did not bar the present Colorado lawsuit under \u201cres judicata\u201d (claim preclusion) because dismissals on those grounds are not judgments on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings in Colorado. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83d\udccc Key point: This lawsuit involves Bruner in the context of oil and gas investment and corporate control disputes, but it was not a verdict or finding of liability against him \u2014 rather, it focused on procedural issues about where the case could properly be heard. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83e\uddfe Additional Litigation Not Directly About Oil, But Related to Bruner in Energy Context Brody v.

Gas expertise (Lost Soldier). Upland Borneo Drilling Services (regional hub and oil experts). Local Sarawak contractors. First ever UK company to partner Petros. Huge BoD experience in Sarawak and Brunei. That's just a few hightlights.  HOWEVER, the key missing ingredient is one of the licences we are looking for (Brunei / Sarawak / Indonesia).  If the BoD get them across the line, this goes absolutely mental.  If they don't, I'll see you in Aldi for home brand beans and cardboard toast! Yes, it's high risk/high reward...BUT the difference this time is that we have a revenue share with Lost Soldier.  First gas this year (maybe even Q3, if not Q4).  With monthly income, if feels the game is changing (in a good way!)",

Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",

Key Case: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner (Colorado, 2022) This case involved a dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers connected to Australian exploration projects. Bruner, alleged to be Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, was accused (along with others) of manipulating corporate control to exclude investors from profits. Procedural Focus, Not Liability An earlier federal lawsuit (2017) alleging fraud and racketeering was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was underway in Australia. In 2022, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that this dismissal did not bar the case from proceeding in Colorado, since it was not a decision on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. No Substantive Finding Against Bruner The appellate decision addressed where the case could be heard, not whether Bruner was liable. Other Related Litigation In Brody v. Bruner (Tenth Circuit), Bruner appeared in connection with PetroHunter, an energy company, in a bankruptcy-related dispute. The court affirmed dismissal of civil conspiracy claims. Bottom line: Bruner has been involved in oil and gas\u2013related litigation primarily over investment control and corporate governance, with rulings focused on procedural issues, not determinations of fraud or liability.",

Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner \u2014 Oil & Gas Investment Dispute (Colorado) This is the key case involving oil and gas business litigation where Marc Bruner was a defendant: Case Overview Name: Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner Court: Colorado Court of Appeals (Colorado, USA) Decision: July 14, 2022 Defendants: Marc Bruner and Michael Caetano Plaintiff: Nation SLP, LLC Core Issue: Dispute among oil and gas investors and company managers about control of profits and corporate governance in Australian oil and gas exploration entities. \ufffd Colorado Lawyer +1 Background The dispute stemmed from investors and related companies formed around exploration permits for oil and gas properties in Australia. Investors created entities like Nation SLP, Paltar Petroleum, and Nation Energy to fund and operate projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Bruner was alleged to have served as Chair and CEO of Paltar Petroleum, with Caetano holding key executive roles in Nation Energy and Nation Australia. The plaintiffs claimed that Bruner and Caetano manipulated boards and company decisions to cut investors out of their share of profits from the exploration projects. \ufffd law.justia.com Lawsuit History Earlier Federal Case (2017): Plaintiffs filed a suit in U.S. District Court (Colorado) alleging fraud, racketeering, and breaches of fiduciary duty involving Bruner and others. That case was dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds because related litigation was pending in Australia, and Australian law governed many claims. \ufffd law.justia.com Colorado Court of Appeals (2022): In Nation SLP, LLC v. Bruner, the Colorado appeals court held that the earlier dismissal for forum non conveniens did not bar the present Colorado lawsuit under \u201cres judicata\u201d (claim preclusion) because dismissals on those grounds are not judgments on the merits. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings in Colorado. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83d\udccc Key point: This lawsuit involves Bruner in the context of oil and gas investment and corporate control disputes, but it was not a verdict or finding of liability against him \u2014 rather, it focused on procedural issues about where the case could properly be heard. \ufffd law.justia.com \ud83e\uddfe Additional Litigation Not Directly About Oil, But Related to Bruner in Energy Context Brody v.

Gas expertise (Lost Soldier). Upland Borneo Drilling Services (regional hub and oil experts). Local Sarawak contractors. First ever UK company to partner Petros. Huge BoD experience in Sarawak and Brunei. That's just a few hightlights.  HOWEVER, the key missing ingredient is one of the licences we are looking for (Brunei / Sarawak / Indonesia).  If the BoD get them across the line, this goes absolutely mental.  If they don't, I'll see you in Aldi for home brand beans and cardboard toast! Yes, it's high risk/high reward...BUT the difference this time is that we have a revenue share with Lost Soldier.  First gas this year (maybe even Q3, if not Q4).  With monthly income, if feels the game is changing (in a good way!)",

Prospective Resources are: * **Undiscovered** * Based on geological interpretation, seismic, and analogs * Dependent on: * A future discovery * Development feasibility * Commercial approval In plain terms: > \u201cWe *think* hydrocarbons might be there, but we haven\u2019t drilled and proven it.\u201d They\u2019re typically expressed with: * **Low / Best / High estimates** * **Chance of Discovery (Pg)** --- ### Why **2C is better than Prospective** \u201cBetter\u201d here means **lower risk and higher confidence**. | Aspect              | 2C Contingent            | Prospective             | | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | | Discovery status    | \u2705 Discovered             | \u274c Undiscovered          | | Geological risk     | Low                      | High                    | | Data quality        | Wells + tests + seismic  | Mostly seismic + models | | Key risk            | Commercial / development | Geological + commercial | | Closer to reserves? | \u2705 Yes                    | \u274c Much earlier          | | Typical value       | Higher                   | Lower                   | So: * **2C has already cleared geological risk** * **Prospective still has to prove hydrocarbons even exist** That\u2019s why investors, lenders, and partners usually: * Discount **Prospective Resources heavily** * Take **2C much more seriously**, especially if contingencies are clear and solvable --- ### Simple analogy * **Prospective**: *\u201cThere might be gold in that mountain.\u201d* * **2C Contingent**: *\u201cWe\u2019ve found gold, measured it, but we haven\u2019t built the mine yet.\u201d*",
