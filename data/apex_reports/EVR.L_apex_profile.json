Since then, EVRAZ used services of another PIP which recently also decided to suspend the coverage of services.\nThe Company has made multiple enquiries to other PIPs authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority but no one expressed willingness to work with EVRAZ.\nThus, starting from 1 March 2023 the Company will be unable to disclose regulatory information or publish other information in the manner and following the procedures required by Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Transparency Rules. The Company will continue to disclose regulatory information by way of announcements on its website.\n###\nFor further information:\nMedia Relations:\n+7 495 937 6871\nmedia@evraz.com\nInvestor Relations:\n+7 495 232 1370\nir@evraz.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement, transmitted by EquityStory RS.

Additionally, EVRAZ wrote to the Secretary of State on 14 December 2022 for guidance, including whether the Secretary of State would exercise powers under the Companies Act 2006 (the \u201cAct\u201d) to appoint an auditor, but has not yet received a response.\nThe deadline for the Company to prepare and publish its annual report and audited financial statements for its previous financial year is 30 April 2023.\nConsidering all the above it is probable that EVRAZ will not be able to prepare and publish annual report and audited financial statements as required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Act as well as approve and file audited financial statements with Companies House.\n###\nFor further information:\nMedia Relations:\n+7 495 937 6871\nmedia@evraz.com\nInvestor Relations:\n+7 495 232 1370\nir@evraz.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), transmitted by EquityStory RS.

The Company also does not expect to make payment of the interest due on 2\nOctober 2022 on its 5.250% Notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d).\nThe Company is currently prohibited from making payments in respect of the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes without a licence from the UK sanctions regulator, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation of HM Treasury (\u201cOFSI\u201d). On 15 July 2022, the Company sent a request for a licence to OFSI in order to pay the interest due on 20 September 2022 on the 2023 Notes, amounting to approximately $18.9 million, as well as the interest due on 2 October 2022 on the 2024 Notes, amounting to approximately $18.4\nmillion. To date, OFSI has not provided the required licence.\nEven if OFSI were to provide the required licence, there would remain significant challenges to making payment of the interest due on the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes. It is not yet clear whether regulatory restrictions or technical issues will prevent the Paying Agent from making, or agreeing to make, payment of the interest due in respect of the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes to the clearing systems. In addition, even if the Company were able to make payment of interest to the clearing systems, payments to a significant number of the holders and beneficial holders of the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes would be blocked by the clearing systems as a result of their holdings being held through the Russian clearing system.\nAs a result, the Company will not make payment of the forthcoming interest payments due on the 2023 Notes and does not expect to make payment of the interest due on\nthe 2024 Notes. The Company is in the process of exploring various options that will allow it to meet its obligations to all Noteholders. The Company will keep investors informed about key developments throughout this process.\nThe EVRAZ group has sufficient liquidity to make all payments due under the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes were it not for sanctions and regulatory restrictions.

The EBITDA margin\n1\ndeclined to 30.7% from 33.7% in H1\n2021. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher coal product sales prices as well as better performance of North American assets.\nCost-cutting and customer focus initiatives generated an effect of\nUS$237 million in EBITDA.\nTotal debt\n1\ndropped by US$136 million to US$3,958 million, while net debt\n1\namounted to US$3,165 million.\nNet profit totalled US$6 million, compared with US$1,212 million in H1 2021.\nThe cash cost of steel and raw materials in Russia was the following:\nThe cash cost of slabs\n1\nincreased to US$358/t from US$283/t in H1\n2021\nThe cash cost of washed coking coal\n1\nincreased to US$62/t from US$36/t in H1 2021\nThe cash cost of iron ore products\n1\nincreased to US$56/t from US$40/t in H1\n2021\nThe Group reported negative free cash flow\n1\nof US$59 million, compared with positive US$836 million in H1 2021 following a surge in working capital due to an increase in inventory and receivables amid hindered exports.\nFinancial Highlights\n(US$ million)\nH1\n2022\nH1\n2021\nChange, %\nConsolidated revenues\n8,097\n6,178\n31.0\nProfit from operations\n383\n1,749\n(78.1)\nConsolidated EBITDA\n1\n2,486\n2,082\n19.4\nNet profit\n6\n1,212\n(99.5)\nNet cash flows from operating activities\n632\n1,410\n(55.1)\nFree cash flow\n1\n(59)\n836\nn/a\nCAPEX\n1\n513\n430\n19.3\n30 June 2022\n31\nDecember 2021\nChange, %\nNet debt\n1\n3,165\n2,667\n18.7\nTotal assets\n13,370\n9,854\n35.6\n1\nFor the definition, see \u201cDefinitions of selected alternative performance measures\u201d.\nCommenting on the results, EVRAZ\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Aleksey Ivanov, said:\n\u201cRecent geopolitical tensions have given rise to significant corporate governance and operating challenges for EVRAZ. On top of that, strong rouble, declining demand for our products, and increased competition on EVRAZ\u2019s traditional markets present additional headwinds.\nIn H1 2022, steel demand went down amid growing worries over the health of the global economy and persistent supply chain challenges. There was bearish sentiment in China due to extended COVID-19 lockdowns, low margins and rising steel inventory. This led to a pullback in steel prices from recent highs across all key markets and especially in China, Europe and India.\nDespite the above, EVRAZ posted strong EBITDA of US$2.5 billion, up 19.4% year-on-year. This was achieved thanks to higher coal sales prices and better performance of our North American operations, as well as our cost-cutting and productivity improvement initiatives and customer focus efforts, which generated a total effect of US$237 million in EBITDA.\nGiven the current macroeconomic backdrop and hindered access to foreign equipment,\nthe schedules of investment projects that are related to the development of EVRAZ and are not currently in the active phase had to be adjusted. Overall CAPEX stood at US$513 million, including US$253 million for development projects.\nIn addition, we slightly improved our debt position, reducing total debt by US$136 million to US$3,958 million while net debt amounted to US$3,165 million. The ratio of net debt to last twelve months (LTM) EBITDA amounted to 0.6x in the reporting period.\nNotwithstanding the current hardships, we remain committed to the sustainable development of our business. We value and protect the health and safety of our personnel. Unfortunately, in H1 2022, we lost four employees, and there were four fatalities among our contractors. Fatal incidents are unacceptable, and EVRAZ is going to do its utmost to prevent them from happening again. We have thoroughly investigated the underlying causes of these tragedies and introduced measures to mitigate causes and minimise risks.\nIn H1 2022, we also maintained close communication with our employees, communities where we operate, and other relevant stakeholders. In its ESG efforts, EVRAZ is consistently transparent, providing regular and comprehensive non-financial disclosures in line with GRI, SASB and TCFD standards.\nGeopolitical tensions, mounting economic pressure and sanctions are continuing to shape EVRAZ\u2019s operating environment in H2 2022, but we are adapting our business to the new reality and working to deliver on our commitments to customers, suppliers and employees.\u201d\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains \u201cforward-look",

Sanctions will literally have opposite of intended effect if TG group assumptions are correct. Russia to win, foreigners to lose. If this plays true, I\u2019d suspect sanctioned funds could be used to compensate foreign holders eventually. As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it. With transfer of PLC assets to Russian based NTMK, foreign holders potentially come out with 0 all round, whilst Russian holders cash in historic assets. The system is clearly broken.

It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin. I wont even bother to make any comments regarding the Wests muppet-ex-comedian-come-president other than he will get his comeuppance sooner rather than later.

Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

Important update on Evraz PLC shares We want to keep you informed about recent developments affecting Evraz PLC shares. Due to UK sanctions, Evraz PLC shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

It is my view point, that value is being transferred from business in line with suspension of Evraz PLC rights, above and beyond all else, so Evraz can continue operations without sanction restrictions in place. We still do not know when the war is ending. How that affects PLC when sanctions are lifted, we are yet to see. But this narrative that all is lost, if we don\u2019t take up NTMK, is currently absolute tosh. I do notice a complete lack of discussion on how westerners taking up NTMK could be a direct violation of sanctions on a personal level. FOMO has removed this threat from the equation. RA was a majority holder in PLC, he will also be majority holder in NTMK. Many law firms wouldn\u2019t go any where near this NTMK transfer process, which says a lot on its own.",

LOL Reality. \"The En+ Group has been removed from sanctions lists, specifically the U.S. Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, in January 2019. This was the result of a corporate restructuring agreement with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to limit the control of founder Oleg Deripaska\". \"Sanctions lifted: The U.S. lifted sanctions on En+ Group and its subsidiaries, including Rusal, in January 2019. Corporate restructuring: The company agreed to significant changes to reduce Deripaska's control and ownership stake. New governance: The restructuring included appointing independent directors to the board and reducing Deripaska's voting rights. Ongoing compliance: En+ Group is subject to ongoing auditing and reporting requirements by OFAC to ensure continued compliance with the agreement\". So in fact it was sanctioned at one time and later these were removed due to restructuring. Hardly the same at all.",

That\u2019s why, even if sanctions lift later, there\u2019s nothing left to unlock for UK shareholders.

Of course I'm annoyed. - Trump's highly unpredictable, so he can change his position at anytime.  Historically, Russian citizens can put up with a lot.  So Putin's fate may be tied-in with taking just enough of Ukraine to present it as a win to his people. All Donbas seems a minimum. But Ukraine's defences are well fortified. It may take a few years for Russia to achieve that goal, according to military experts. Then there'd have to be a lasting peace settlement agreed by BOTH sides, probably involving significant reparation payments, et al. By the time all that's settled, we're possibly close to a post-Putin era. So this war seems likely to drag on & suspending EVR has  achieved nothing useful whatsoever. Only loss for many PI's & those pension funds significantly invested in EVR as it paid decent dividends.",

While the sale of its North American assets has been completed, any dealings with the sanctioned parent company and its remaining Russian operations are forbidden for UK persons and entities\u2019 Not sure how taking up NTMK allocations, sending detailed paperwork to Russia etc, gets around above. By association, foreign/UK holders will only have NTMK shares due to their existing holdings in PLC and going through the extensive reallocation process. With the complexity of it, it\u2019s not like any transfers/foreign NTMK holders will be able to play the ignorance card. If the process was automatic, this would have been an option.

If this plays true, I\u2019d suspect sanctioned funds could be used to compensate foreign holders eventually. As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it. With transfer of PLC assets to Russian based NTMK, foreign holders potentially come out with 0 all round, whilst Russian holders cash in historic assets. The system is clearly broken.

It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin.

Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

Due to UK sanctions, Evraz PLC shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

It is my view point, that value is being transferred from business in line with suspension of Evraz PLC rights, above and beyond all else, so Evraz can continue operations without sanction restrictions in place. We still do not know when the war is ending. How that affects PLC when sanctions are lifted, we are yet to see. But this narrative that all is lost, if we don\u2019t take up NTMK, is currently absolute tosh. I do notice a complete lack of discussion on how westerners taking up NTMK could be a direct violation of sanctions on a personal level. FOMO has removed this threat from the equation. RA was a majority holder in PLC, he will also be majority holder in NTMK. Many law firms wouldn\u2019t go any where near this NTMK transfer process, which says a lot on its own.",

So sanctions weren\u2019t just an excuse \u2014 they were a strategic window. More precisely (and safely phrased): Russian law and courts were used to transfer assets away from foreign-listed parents during a period when those parents were legally and practically unable to act. That\u2019s why, even if sanctions lift later, there\u2019s nothing left to unlock for UK shareholders. In plain English: They didn\u2019t wait for sanctions to end \u2014 they made them irrelevant by acting first.",

This was the result of a corporate restructuring agreement with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to limit the control of founder Oleg Deripaska\". \"Sanctions lifted: The U.S. lifted sanctions on En+ Group and its subsidiaries, including Rusal, in January 2019. Corporate restructuring: The company agreed to significant changes to reduce Deripaska's control and ownership stake. New governance: The restructuring included appointing independent directors to the board and reducing Deripaska's voting rights. Ongoing compliance: En+ Group is subject to ongoing auditing and reporting requirements by OFAC to ensure continued compliance with the agreement\". So in fact it was sanctioned at one time and later these were removed due to restructuring. Hardly the same at all.",

I assume there is very small margin of investors who have a clear route to claiming shares in the new entity subject to UK Sanctions as well as Russian law section: FZ-470. \"In short, you cannot simply sell your shares (or the right to them) to a legal entity for consideration without facing a very high risk of violating UK sanctions law. The act of selling is a prohibited \"dealing,\" and the transaction as a whole would likely be classified as a criminal act of circumvention. The UK's sanctions regime is intentionally broad to prevent any and all activities that would benefit the Russian state, its economy, or its entities. Your only path forward, if you are a UK citizen, is to seek a specific license from OFSI for this transaction, which would likely be a long and difficult process with no guarantee of success\" If anybody goes through the process of applying for a license, by all means, please share your specific conditions. There is likely a time limit. KR",

Of course I'm annoyed. - Trump's highly unpredictable, so he can change his position at anytime.  Historically, Russian citizens can put up with a lot.  So Putin's fate may be tied-in with taking just enough of Ukraine to present it as a win to his people. All Donbas seems a minimum. But Ukraine's defences are well fortified. It may take a few years for Russia to achieve that goal, according to military experts. Then there'd have to be a lasting peace settlement agreed by BOTH sides, probably involving significant reparation payments, et al. By the time all that's settled, we're possibly close to a post-Putin era. So this war seems likely to drag on & suspending EVR has  achieved nothing useful whatsoever. Only loss for many PI's & those pension funds significantly invested in EVR as it paid decent dividends.",

As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it. With transfer of PLC assets to Russian based NTMK, foreign holders potentially come out with 0 all round, whilst Russian holders cash in historic assets. The system is clearly broken.

It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin. I wont even bother to make any comments regarding the Wests muppet-ex-comedian-come-president other than he will get his comeuppance sooner rather than later.

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

          "content": "John714 Jeez, you really need to lose the narcissistic mentality, and stop listening to the mainstream Western biased, Russia/Putin hating media, including GBN. Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

Maybe try broadening your horizons and look at information provided by independent, non-biased, unaffiliated media outlets because they tell a different story. It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin. I wont even bother to make any comments regarding the Wests muppet-ex-comedian-come-president other than he will get his comeuppance sooner rather than later. Oh and by the way I have over 40,000 shares in EVRAZ so I really do have a vested interest in this issue.",

As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it. With transfer of PLC assets to Russian based NTMK, foreign holders potentially come out with 0 all round, whilst Russian holders cash in historic assets. The system is clearly broken.

This was the result of a corporate restructuring agreement with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to limit the control of founder Oleg Deripaska\". \"Sanctions lifted: The U.S. lifted sanctions on En+ Group and its subsidiaries, including Rusal, in January 2019. Corporate restructuring: The company agreed to significant changes to reduce Deripaska's control and ownership stake. New governance: The restructuring included appointing independent directors to the board and reducing Deripaska's voting rights. Ongoing compliance: En+ Group is subject to ongoing auditing and reporting requirements by OFAC to ensure continued compliance with the agreement\". So in fact it was sanctioned at one time and later these were removed due to restructuring. Hardly the same at all.",

But this narrative that all is lost, if we don\u2019t take up NTMK, is currently absolute tosh. I do notice a complete lack of discussion on how westerners taking up NTMK could be a direct violation of sanctions on a personal level. FOMO has removed this threat from the equation. RA was a majority holder in PLC, he will also be majority holder in NTMK. Many law firms wouldn\u2019t go any where near this NTMK transfer process, which says a lot on its own.",

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

Important update on Evraz PLC shares We want to keep you informed about recent developments affecting Evraz PLC shares. Due to UK sanctions, Evraz PLC shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin.

Sanctions will literally have opposite of intended effect if TG group assumptions are correct. Russia to win, foreigners to lose. If this plays true, I\u2019d suspect sanctioned funds could be used to compensate foreign holders eventually. As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it. With transfer of PLC assets to Russian based NTMK, foreign holders potentially come out with 0 all round, whilst Russian holders cash in historic assets. The system is clearly broken.

I\u2019ve been contacted by Jarvis , which is about to cease business, and told it can\u2019t transfer my SIPP to another provider because my EVR shares are suspended and so can\u2019t be moved. My concern is that as Jarvis is the holder of my shares as nominee, how can my  share ownership be proven, going forward if it no longer exists? Anyone else In the same position? And yes, I recognise the shares may be worthless by the time they come out of suspension. TC",

It is my view point, that value is being transferred from business in line with suspension of Evraz PLC rights, above and beyond all else, so Evraz can continue operations without sanction restrictions in place. We still do not know when the war is ending. How that affects PLC when sanctions are lifted, we are yet to see. But this narrative that all is lost, if we don\u2019t take up NTMK, is currently absolute tosh. I do notice a complete lack of discussion on how westerners taking up NTMK could be a direct violation of sanctions on a personal level. FOMO has removed this threat from the equation. RA was a majority holder in PLC, he will also be majority holder in NTMK. Many law firms wouldn\u2019t go any where near this NTMK transfer process, which says a lot on its own.",

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

Important update on Evraz PLC shares We want to keep you informed about recent developments affecting Evraz PLC shares. Due to UK sanctions, Evraz PLC shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

No they do not, in the same way that India, and China etc restricts imports or ownership of assets to protect it's local producers so does everyone else. In the west, unlike in your country, we have multiple sources of information, not just state sanctioned ones, but that does not fit your narrative, I know. What were the agreements when NK sent troops into the war for RU? Were they sent as volunteers? They were not, it was a bilateral agreement between the two nations. Prince Andrew is really no different to other \"leaders\" or people in positions of power. Are you really going to say that these things do not happen in your country? It does not make either right, but all governments control their laws and how they are enacted to greater or lesser degrees, but it's a fact of life I suppose. I won't bother stating examples in your country, I don't have the time or inclination. GLASH.",

It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin. I wont even bother to make any comments regarding the Wests muppet-ex-comedian-come-president other than he will get his comeuppance sooner rather than later.

As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it.

It is my view point, that value is being transferred from business in line with suspension of Evraz PLC rights, above and beyond all else, so Evraz can continue operations without sanction restrictions in place. We still do not know when the war is ending. How that affects PLC when sanctions are lifted, we are yet to see. But this narrative that all is lost, if we don\u2019t take up NTMK, is currently absolute tosh. I do notice a complete lack of discussion on how westerners taking up NTMK could be a direct violation of sanctions on a personal level. FOMO has removed this threat from the equation. RA was a majority holder in PLC, he will also be majority holder in NTMK. Many law firms wouldn\u2019t go any where near this NTMK transfer process, which says a lot on its own.",

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

Important update on Evraz PLC shares We want to keep you informed about recent developments affecting Evraz PLC shares. Due to UK sanctions, Evraz PLC shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

Maybe try broadening your horizons and look at information provided by independent, non-biased, unaffiliated media outlets because they tell a different story. It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin. I wont even bother to make any comments regarding the Wests muppet-ex-comedian-come-president other than he will get his comeuppance sooner rather than later.

As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it.

That\u2019s why, even if sanctions lift later, there\u2019s nothing left to unlock for UK shareholders.

Corporate restructuring: The company agreed to significant changes to reduce Deripaska's control and ownership stake. New governance: The restructuring included appointing independent directors to the board and reducing Deripaska's voting rights.

It is my view point, that value is being transferred from business in line with suspension of Evraz PLC rights, above and beyond all else, so Evraz can continue operations without sanction restrictions in place. We still do not know when the war is ending. How that affects PLC when sanctions are lifted, we are yet to see. But this narrative that all is lost, if we don\u2019t take up NTMK, is currently absolute tosh. I do notice a complete lack of discussion on how westerners taking up NTMK could be a direct violation of sanctions on a personal level. FOMO has removed this threat from the equation. RA was a majority holder in PLC, he will also be majority holder in NTMK. Many law firms wouldn\u2019t go any where near this NTMK transfer process, which says a lot on its own.",

Nov 25 (Interfax) - JSC Evraz Kachkanarsky Mining andPr ocessing Plant (Evraz KGOK), based in the Sverdlovsk region, has received approval for a transaction that will make it the owner of 93.2% of the shares of PJSC Raspadskaya (MOEX: RASP) and 51% of the Timir mining and metallurgical company, previously held by Evraz Plc. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the relevant order, on a special decision on the execution of transactions involving JSCKa chkanarsky Mining and Processing Plant. Evraz KGOK sued Evraz Group SA in the Moscow Arbitration Court for 196.7 billion rubles and $172.8 million in the spring, and filed a motion to seize the respondent's stakes in Russian companies. Evraz Plc was later named as a co-respondent. The case was heard behind closed doors, and Evraz KGOK's claim was granted in June.The government included another division of the group, steel maker Evraz Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant (Evraz NTMK) in the list of economically significant organizations in January 2025. The Moscow Region Arbitration Court decided to suspend the corporate rights of Evraz Plc in Evraz NTMK in July. Evraz said at the time that it planned to consolidate its Russian assets around Evraz NTMK, which will be renamed PJSC Evraz after the completion of all necessary procedures and then go public. The new company's shares are expected to start trading on the Moscow Exchange in  the first half of 2026 .Evraz NTMK sued Evraz Plc for 97.6 billion rubles in the Moscow Arbitration Court in June, seeking to recover this amount be recovered through the disposal of the respondent's assets in Russia. The next hearing will be held on February 2. The Evraz Group's Russian plants have been on the U.S. Treasury's SDN List since 2024. Evraz, as well as its main shareholders as of the end of 2021, namely Roman Abramovich with 28.6%, Alexander Abramov with 19.3%  and Alexander Frolov with 9.7%, have also been on UK sanctions lists since 2022.",

I\u2019ve not yet had any correspondence from my brokers yet but think I am playing the waiting game and may look into the Negligible Value Claims but need to look into all the options further then read and re read them to understand the process properly. If shares you own become worthless (or \"of negligible value\") while you still own them, you can make a \"negligible value claim\" to HMRC. This treats the shares as if you had sold and immediately reacquired them at their negligible value, which crystallises a capital loss without an actual sale. You can specify a date for the deemed disposal up to two years prior to the start of the tax year in which you make the claim, allowing you to use the loss against gains from an earlier period.",

Important update on Evraz PLC shares We want to keep you informed about recent developments affecting Evraz PLC shares. Due to UK sanctions, Evraz PLC shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. This means you cannot buy, sell, or transfer these shares and dividend payments are also blocked until further notice. Evraz PLC has announced a corporate action offering shareholders the option to convert their Evraz PLC shares into shares of its Russian subsidiary, PJSC EVRAZ NTMK. However, this option is subject to significant restrictions: \u2022 Converted shares would be held in a Russian \u201cType C\u201d account, which cannot be accessed or traded outside Russia. \u2022 UK sanctions still apply, so you would not be able to realise any value from these shares under current conditions. \u2022 There is ongoing market uncertainty relating to Russian stock that could further impact the value of these holdings. What does this mean for you? \u2022 Option 1: You can choose to do nothing and keep your Evraz PLC shares, though they remain suspended from trading; \u2022 Option 2: You can apply directly to Evraz PLC; or \u2022 Option 3: As an alternative, you may wish to seek independent tax advice about claiming a capital loss. Should you wish to choose Option 2: o we strongly recommend that you seek independent advice, as Option 2 will not restore liquidity or remove sanctions. o Barclays is unable to support or advise you in relation to the best course of action to take. o please contact Evraz PLC directly before the deadline set by Evraz PLC [24th November] or see the Evraz PLC website for further information. Specific details have been published here: https://www.evraz.ru/files/investors/regulations-en.pdf We understand this situation is complex and frustrating. Unfortunately, until sanctions are lifted or new guidance is issued, options for UK investors remain very limited. For more details, please visit the Evraz PLC\u2019s official shareholder update page or speak to an independent financial adviser.",

Like I said before, Putin didn't just wake up one morning and decide to invade a sovereign country this has been ongoing since 2014. Tell me why when he took Crimea back in 2014, apart from a few disgruntled words there was no reaction from the West? I'll tell you why, because the West really didn't have an argument,  they were well aware of wide spread persecution of ethnic Russians in the Donbas regions (over 13,000 Killed by 2021), they initiated and supported the 2014 political coup to remove the then pro-Russian president of Ukraine, they pushed Ukraine to block Russian maritime operations in the Black Sea and close Russia's Sevastopol Naval Base, the home of Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. This whole fiasco started back in 2014 because of the West yet again interfering in a sovereign nations political structure to achieve regime change for their own benefit. To try and pacify Russia, in 2014 and 2015 the West came up with the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 agreements, both failed due to non-partisan Ukrainian militias refusing to stop the conflict against ethnic Russians. Let's fast-forward to 2018 when Ukraine cancelled the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership which was based on Recognition of Borders: Russia formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Non-Aggression Clause: Both sides pledged not to use force against each other, Economic & Cultural Cooperation: It encouraged trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect for national interests. Ukraine used Crimea as the excuse for this, why did it take 4 years for this decision? It's quite ironic that shortly after this decision Ukraine started banging the drums for Western integration which included becoming part of the EU and a member of NATO. This for Putin was a big red flag and he told Ukraine and the West that no more NATO backed nations would be allowed to border Russia, and that there would be consequences if this was progressed. The rest as they say is history and why we're seeing the slow but sure obliteration of Ukraine and the massive loss of life. The mere notion that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia is ludicrous, the West has always known this  yet they keep playing their puppet Zelensky telling him to keep fighting whilst at the same time insane amounts of money for arms is being manipulated through the system to the benefit of the elite few. So yep, it's as simple as that!!",

So while it was wrong of the Russian bear to lash out, it was wrong of the West (the USA) to poke and bait the angry paranoid bear.  It\u2019s not black and white.  For myself, I hope it ends soon.

It's ironic don't you think that now Ukraine are being defeated on all fronts the Western media have gone very quiet! I am certainly not a supporter of Putin or what he is doing, but he didn't just decide to invade Ukraine because he had nothing else to do, actions by NATO and the West forced his hand and even Trump acknowledges this. Western governments are just as much or more to blame for this fiasco as is Putin. I wont even bother to make any comments regarding the Wests muppet-ex-comedian-come-president other than he will get his comeuppance sooner rather than later.

As you suggest, Evraz was not sanctioned for many years previous to this, which does mean a lot of foreign cash is tied up in it.

So sanctions weren\u2019t just an excuse \u2014 they were a strategic window. More precisely (and safely phrased): Russian law and courts were used to transfer assets away from foreign-listed parents during a period when those parents were legally and practically unable to act. That\u2019s why, even if sanctions lift later, there\u2019s nothing left to unlock for UK shareholders. In plain English: They didn\u2019t wait for sanctions to end \u2014 they made them irrelevant by acting first.",

Corporate restructuring: The company agreed to significant changes to reduce Deripaska's control and ownership stake. New governance: The restructuring included appointing independent directors to the board and reducing Deripaska's voting rights.
