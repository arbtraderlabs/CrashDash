Since then, EVRAZ used services of another PIP which recently also decided to suspend the coverage of services.\nThe Company has made multiple enquiries to other PIPs authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority but no one expressed willingness to work with EVRAZ.\nThus, starting from 1 March 2023 the Company will be unable to disclose regulatory information or publish other information in the manner and following the procedures required by Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Transparency Rules. The Company will continue to disclose regulatory information by way of announcements on its website.\n###\nFor further information:\nMedia Relations:\n+7 495 937 6871\nmedia@evraz.com\nInvestor Relations:\n+7 495 232 1370\nir@evraz.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement, transmitted by EquityStory RS.
