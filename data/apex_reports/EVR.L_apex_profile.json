Since then, EVRAZ used services of another PIP which recently also decided to suspend the coverage of services.\nThe Company has made multiple enquiries to other PIPs authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority but no one expressed willingness to work with EVRAZ.\nThus, starting from 1 March 2023 the Company will be unable to disclose regulatory information or publish other information in the manner and following the procedures required by Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Transparency Rules. The Company will continue to disclose regulatory information by way of announcements on its website.\n###\nFor further information:\nMedia Relations:\n+7 495 937 6871\nmedia@evraz.com\nInvestor Relations:\n+7 495 232 1370\nir@evraz.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement, transmitted by EquityStory RS.

Additionally, EVRAZ wrote to the Secretary of State on 14 December 2022 for guidance, including whether the Secretary of State would exercise powers under the Companies Act 2006 (the \u201cAct\u201d) to appoint an auditor, but has not yet received a response.\nThe deadline for the Company to prepare and publish its annual report and audited financial statements for its previous financial year is 30 April 2023.\nConsidering all the above it is probable that EVRAZ will not be able to prepare and publish annual report and audited financial statements as required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Act as well as approve and file audited financial statements with Companies House.\n###\nFor further information:\nMedia Relations:\n+7 495 937 6871\nmedia@evraz.com\nInvestor Relations:\n+7 495 232 1370\nir@evraz.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), transmitted by EquityStory RS.
