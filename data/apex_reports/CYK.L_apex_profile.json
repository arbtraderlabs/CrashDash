      "Zero volatility (ATR\u202f=\u202f0, 20\u2011day StdDev\u202f=\u202f0) and no RNS or social posts confirm an absence of market activity, pointing to a liquidity void and a lack of organic investor engagement."

      "The lack of posts coupled with a 333\u202f% momentum increase hints at an artificial spike, often a hallmark of pump\u2011and\u2011dump or institutional pre\u2011announcement activity."
