      "The Google Trends signal \u2018dead_ticker \u2013 DOWN\u2019 coupled with 0/100 interest and \u201368% momentum confirms that the market perceives the company as non\u2011existent or in liquidation.",

      "The simultaneous disappearance of price, volatility, and sentiment metrics suggests a regulatory suspension or delisting rather than a mere price slump.",
      "The absence of any RNS announcements or catalysts, combined with a 10/21 base score, points to a dormant shell that may be used for a reverse takeover or a fresh listing under a new name."

    "contrarian_signals": [
      "While the consensus signals a dead ticker, shell companies on the AIM are occasionally revived through reverse takeovers or new capital injections. If a strategic buyer emerges, CYK.L could re\u2011enter the market at a fraction of its former value."

The only realistic upside comes from a rare reverse takeover or fresh listing under a new identity, which would require close monitoring of regulatory filings.
