Strong interest from potential partners reinforce our confidence in the platform's ability to generate solid revenues and transform our business over time.\n\"This fundraise, which has been supported by a number of our longstanding shareholders, will allow us to accelerate commercialisation, invest in strategic partnerships and targeted global marketing; and further strengthen our proprietary technologies. This will place the Company in a strong position for sustainable growth and help to generate long term value for our shareholders.\"\nFurther details of the Fundraise are set out below.\nBackground to and reasons for the\nFundraise\nThrough the successful collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (\"\nNCI\n\") in the United Sates, the directors of the Company (the \"\nDirectors\n\" or together, the \"\nBoard\n\") believe that the Company has now validated the OptiMAL\u00ae platform with the platform performing in line with and in certain instances exceeding target performance parameters laid out by the Company.\nThe formal launch of the OptiMAL\u00ae platform took place on 15 December 2025 at the Antibody Engineering and Therapeutics conference in San Diego, an established conference which attracts a wide range of technical experts in the antibody discovery field. Fusion's attendance at the conference generated significant interest in both the OptiMAL\u00ae platform and the Company as well as provided further encouragement that the OptiMAL\u00ae platform has every prospect of potential material revenue generation and the potential to favourably transform Fusion's business over time.\nThe Directors believe that the initial soundings and market research, including discussions with a number of potential clients, have been very positive. Many of the organizations approached in the pre-launch phase have expressed an interest in the OptiMAL\u00ae platform including disclosure of target details under non-disclosure agreements, resulting in multiple opportunities being registered in the Company's sales opportunities pipeline, which has a combined potential value in excess of \u00a31 million. While these opportunities remain at an early stage and will take some time to convert (if at all), the level of interest in the OptiMAL\u00ae platform provides encouraging signs of the commercial potential of this platform.\nAgainst the backdrop of the formal launch of the OptiMAL\u00ae platform and the reasons outlined above, the Board believes that it is well positioned for significant growth but remains cautiously mindful of the potential market volatility and the inherent science-based risks in the work being undertaken by its clients, which can potentially impact the visibility of revenue streams.\nThe Board is aware of the significant advantages that the Company's proprietary platforms including OptiMAL\u00ae, OptiPhageTM and AI/ML-abTM can provide to clients in their pursuit of new antibody therapeutics and so are supportive of accelerating the commercialisation of these platforms starting with OptiMAL\u00ae.\nReasons for the\nFundraise\nAs previously announced, it had been a key focus of the Board for the Company to achieve cash flow breakeven without needing to raise additional funds. While the Company was on track to achieve this, the extremely tight control of costs that would have been required would impact on the speed of the roll out of a commercially robust OptiMAL\u00ae platform by the Company and the dedicated marketing activities required post formal launch. The Board considers that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to conduct the Fundraise in order to provide the capital for the commercialisation of the OptiMAL\u00ae platform, associated equipment and global marketing activities, to improve the overall cash position of the business and provide it with increased working capital to generate supporting data for its key proprietary platforms, namely OptiMAL\u00ae, OptiPhageTM and Mammalian Display.\nUse of proceeds\nThe net proceeds receivable by the Company pursuant to the Fundraise, being approximately \u00a31.3 million, will be used for the purchase of certain laboratory equipment to enhance the efficiency of the OptiMAL\u00ae platform, to invest in the Company's commercial activities and for general working capital purposes. The commercial plans will focus on increasing the Company's presence in key geographic markets, such as North America, and promoting OptiMAL\u00ae through various marketing activities, including but not limited to, attendance at key industry conferences and follow on business development trips.\nDetails of the Placing and the Subscription\nThe Placing will result in the issue of a total of 10,904,121 Placing Shares and the Subscription will result in the issue of 152,784 Subscription Shares, in each case at the Issue Price. Together, the Placing and Subscription has raised \u00a31,437,397.65 before expenses for the Company. The Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares will be issued on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authorities granted to the Board at the 2025 AGM.\nThe Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares, when issued and fully paid, will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares in issue and therefore will rank equally for all dividends or other distributions declared, made or paid after the issue of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares.\nAllenby Capital and Shard have entered into a Placing Agreement with the Company pursuant to which Allenby Capital and Shard have, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out therein, undertaken to use their respective reasonable endeavours to procure subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price. The Placing Agreement contains certain warranties and indemnities from the Company in favour of Allenby Capital and Shard. The Placing is not being underwritten by Allenby Capital, Shard or any other person.\nDirector participation in the Subscription\nColin Walsh, a Non-Executive Director of the Company, has subscribed for 152,784 Subscription Shares at the Issue Price pursuant to the Subscription. Following Admission (as defined below), Mr Walsh will have a total direct and indirect beneficial interest in 3,531,785 Ordinary Shares, equivalent to approximately 2.82% of Fusion's total issued ordinary share capital (as enlarged by the issue of the Placing Shares, the Subscription Shares and the Director Shares). 715,284 of these Ordinary Shares are held directly, 211,618 are held by Crescent Capital III GP Limited (\"\nCrescent III Ltd\n\"), which is controlled by Mr Walsh, 1,204,883 are held by Walsh Strategic Management Limited (\"\nWSML\n\"), another company controlled by Mr Walsh and 1,400,000 are held by HamNiv (GP) Limited, a subsidiary of Crescent Capital NI Limited. Mr Walsh is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crescent Capital NI Limited.\nThe tables below, which have been provided in accordance with the requirements of the UK Market Abuse Regulation, provide further details of the transactions.\nProposed issue of Director Shares\nAs disclosed in the Company's annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025, the remuneration committee recommended, and the Board accepted, a bonus award for Adrian Kinkaid (CEO) and Richard Buick (CSO) each of 20% of their gross salary, against their maximum contractual bonus of 45% and 40% respectively. In recognition that the Company is still controlling costs tightly and cognisant of the cash position, it was agreed that the bonus award be split into two components: 40% cash and the remainder to be satisfied via the issue of new Ordinary Shares once the Company was in an open period.\nTherefore, immediately following the publication of this announcement, 308,720 new Ordinary Shares will be issued and allotted to Adrian Kinkaid (CEO) and Richard Buick (CSO) at a deemed subscription price equal to the Issue Price and pursuant to the authorities previously granted at the 2025 AGM, as follows:\nDirector\nAmount of bonus award to be received in Director Shares\nNo. of Director Shares to be issued\nAdrian Kinkaid\n\u00a323,846.94\n183,438\nRichard Buick\n\u00a316,286.66\n125,282\nA further announcement will be provided following the issue and allotment of the Director Shares.\nAdmission to trading on AIM\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the Placing Shares, the Subscription Shares and, once issued, the Director Shares (together, the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is currently anticipated that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares will commence on AIM at 8.00 a.m. on or around\n30 January\n2026.\nTotal voting rights\nOn Admission, the Company will have 125,021,878 Ordinary Shares in issue, each with one voting right. There are no shares held in treasury. Therefore, the Company's total number of Ordinary Shares in issue and voting rights will be 125,021,878 and this figure may be used by shareholders from Admission as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nEnquiries:\nFusion Antibodies plc\nwww.fusionantibodies.com\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer\nStephen Smyth, Chief Financial Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nFusion Antibodies interactive investor hub\nhttps://investorhub.fusionantibodies.com/\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJames Reeve/Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nTony Quirke/Joscelin Pinnington (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nDamon Heath (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 207 186 9952\nWalbrook PR\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nfusion@walbrookpr.com\nAnna Dunphy\nMob: +44 (0)7876 741 001\nThis announcement is made in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of UK MAR and the person responsible for arranging for the release of this announcement on behalf of Fusion is Adrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer.\nDirector/PDMR UK MAR disclosures\nNotification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them.\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\nColin Walsh\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\nNon-Executive Director\nb)\nInitial notification /Amendment\nInitial notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName\nFusion Antibodies plc\nb)\nLEI\n213800KBAYRC9VOQ9V39\n4\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument\nIdentification code\nOrdinary shares of 4p each in Fusion Antibodies plc\nIdentification code (ISIN) for Fusion Antibodies plc ordinary shares: GB00BDQZGK16\nb)\nNature of the transaction\nPurchase of new Ordinary Shares\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s)\nPrice(s)\nVolume(s)\n1\n3p\n1\n52,784\nd)\nAggregated information:\n- Aggregated volume\n- Price\nN/A\ne)\nDate of the transaction\n2\n6\nJanuary 2026 to be completed on 30 January 2026\nf)\nPlace of the transaction\nOutside a trading venue\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\nNotice to Distributors\nSolely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended and as this is applied in the United Kingdom (\"\nMiFID II\n\"); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament, as they form part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the \"\nMiFID II Product Governance Requirements\n\"), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any \"\nmanufacturer\n\" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Ordinary Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that such securities are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the \"\nTarget Market Assessment\n\"). The Ordinary Shares are not appropriate for a target market of investors whose objectives include no capital loss. Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Ordinary Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital projection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Fundraise. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Allenby Capital and Shard will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Ordinary Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\".

In addition, the Company also offers antigen design, antigen expression, antibody purification and sequencing, antibody humanisation using Fusion's proprietary CDRxTM\u00a0platform and\u00a0cell line development, producing antibody generating stable cell lines optimised for use downstream by the customer to produce material for clinical trials. Since 2012,\u00a0the Company has successfully sequenced and expressed many thousands of antibodies and successfully completed over 290 humanisation projects for its international customer base, which has included eight of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies by revenue.\nAt every stage, our client's vision is central to how we work in\ncombining the latest technological advances with cutting edge science.\nIn this work our world-class discovery (\nOptiMAL\u00ae\nand OptiPhageTM), humanization and antibody optimization platforms harness the power of natural somatic hypermutation (SHM)\nto\nensure the best molecule goes to the clinic.\nFusion Antibodies' growth strategy is based on enabling Pharma and Biotech companies get to the clinic more effectively, using molecules with optimized therapeutic profile and enhanced potential for successful development and approval and, ultimately, on speeding up the drug discovery and development process. Our\nIntegrated Therapeutic Antibody Services (\"ITA\") offering enhances the efficiency of this process by providing a continuous service offering from as early as target nomination to as far as a stable cell line.\nFusion's use of SHM to create a fully human antibody library to capture the human antibody repertoire addresses a continuing market need in antibody discovery.\nFusion Antibodies' emphasis on antibody therapeutics is based on the size and growth rate in the sector, with the market valued at $253 billion in 2024 and forecast to reach nearly $500 billion by 2029. From 2020 to 2024 there have been 63 antibody therapeutics granted approval in either the USA or the EU, of which 30 were for cancer and there were nine antibodies each with sales of more than $5 billion in 2023.\nWhile therapeutic antibodies are our primary focus, all the services are directly applicable to the Diagnostic sector and also the new, more embryonic veterinary markets and diversification into these markets gives the Company further growth opportunities.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Consequently, the NCI has provided Fusion with a proposal to extend the collaboration agreement entered in November 2023 (the \"\nAgreement\n\") to allow screening of several named targets.\nHaving reviewed the initial proposal for an extension to the Agreement, Richard Buick, CSO, and Adrian Kinkaid, CEO, met with Mitchell Ho of the NCI at the recent Antibody Engineering and Therapeutics conference in San Diego. The discussions included options to extend the NCI's use of OptiMAL\u00ae and various administrative pathways to achieve this. The immediate needs of NCI are to support current and imminent screening projects using OptiMAL\u00ae. The latest discussions also encompassed possible additional projects with enhanced ownership for Fusion Antibodies.\nNegotiations regarding the expanded proposed programme are expected to continue into early 2026. Due to the scale of the proposal, formal approval processes at the US National Institutes of Health (of which the NCI is part) are likely to take several further months to complete. While discussions are progressing, there is no assurance that an extension to the Agreement will be reached, nor as to the timing or final terms of such an extension.\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer of Fusion Antibodies, commented:\n\"The NCI's interest in continuing to use OptiMAL\u00ae is a strong validation of the platform following the initial programme. We are encouraged by the constructive discussions around extending the collaboration and supporting additional targets, while recognising that formal approval processes are still ongoing.\"\nFurther updates will be provided in due course.\nEnquiries:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions on this announcement via our investor hub\nInvestor hub\nFusion Antibodies plc\nwww.fusionantibodies.com\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer\nStephen Smyth, Chief Financial Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJames Reeve/Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nTony Quirke/Joscelin Pinnington (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nDamon Heath (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 207 186 9952\nWalbrook PR\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\u00a0fusion@walbrookpr.com\nAnna Dunphy\nMob: +44 (0)7876 741 001\nFusion Antibodies wants to keep its investors up to date with developments in the Company technology and offerings.
