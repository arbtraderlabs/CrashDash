Consequently, the NCI has provided Fusion with a proposal to extend the collaboration agreement entered in November 2023 (the \"\nAgreement\n\") to allow screening of several named targets.\nHaving reviewed the initial proposal for an extension to the Agreement, Richard Buick, CSO, and Adrian Kinkaid, CEO, met with Mitchell Ho of the NCI at the recent Antibody Engineering and Therapeutics conference in San Diego. The discussions included options to extend the NCI's use of OptiMAL\u00ae and various administrative pathways to achieve this. The immediate needs of NCI are to support current and imminent screening projects using OptiMAL\u00ae. The latest discussions also encompassed possible additional projects with enhanced ownership for Fusion Antibodies.\nNegotiations regarding the expanded proposed programme are expected to continue into early 2026. Due to the scale of the proposal, formal approval processes at the US National Institutes of Health (of which the NCI is part) are likely to take several further months to complete. While discussions are progressing, there is no assurance that an extension to the Agreement will be reached, nor as to the timing or final terms of such an extension.\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer of Fusion Antibodies, commented:\n\"The NCI's interest in continuing to use OptiMAL\u00ae is a strong validation of the platform following the initial programme.
