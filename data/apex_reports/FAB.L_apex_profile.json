Consequently, the NCI has provided Fusion with a proposal to extend the collaboration agreement entered in November 2023 (the \"\nAgreement\n\") to allow screening of several named targets.\nHaving reviewed the initial proposal for an extension to the Agreement, Richard Buick, CSO, and Adrian Kinkaid, CEO, met with Mitchell Ho of the NCI at the recent Antibody Engineering and Therapeutics conference in San Diego. The discussions included options to extend the NCI's use of OptiMAL\u00ae and various administrative pathways to achieve this. The immediate needs of NCI are to support current and imminent screening projects using OptiMAL\u00ae. The latest discussions also encompassed possible additional projects with enhanced ownership for Fusion Antibodies.\nNegotiations regarding the expanded proposed programme are expected to continue into early 2026. Due to the scale of the proposal, formal approval processes at the US National Institutes of Health (of which the NCI is part) are likely to take several further months to complete. While discussions are progressing, there is no assurance that an extension to the Agreement will be reached, nor as to the timing or final terms of such an extension.\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer of Fusion Antibodies, commented:\n\"The NCI's interest in continuing to use OptiMAL\u00ae is a strong validation of the platform following the initial programme. We are encouraged by the constructive discussions around extending the collaboration and supporting additional targets, while recognising that formal approval processes are still ongoing.\"\nFurther updates will be provided in due course.\nEnquiries:\nInvestor questions on this announcement\nWe encourage all investors to share questions on this announcement via our investor hub\nInvestor hub\nFusion Antibodies plc\nwww.fusionantibodies.com\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer\nStephen Smyth, Chief Financial Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJames Reeve/Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nTony Quirke/Joscelin Pinnington (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nDamon Heath (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 207 186 9952\nWalbrook PR\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\u00a0fusion@walbrookpr.com\nAnna Dunphy\nMob: +44 (0)7876 741 001\nFusion Antibodies wants to keep its investors up to date with developments in the Company technology and offerings.

During the validation project, run with the NCI, the platform consistently generated high quality antibodies against a range of targets and exceeded our expectations in terms of affinities achieved, especially against peptide targets. Crucially, the ultimate proof of validation is that the NCI themselves wish to continue using OptiMAL\u00ae as a front-line means of identifying human antibodies against a wide range of targets for years to come. Now that the US government shutdown has been brought to an end, we expect to be making progress in securing an agreement which allows the NCI to continue to use OptiMAL\u00ae.\n\"The validation project with NCI has also exemplified the ability to transfer the technology to another laboratory and so signalled the potential for a highly scalable, and profitable, licensing-based business model. This positions Fusion Antibodies to generate significantly greater long-term value beyond its existing custom services business.\n\"Having had a presence at several recent industry conferences, including ELRIG Drug Discovery, BIO Europe, PEGS Europe, we have received feedback from prospective clients with several expressing an interest in trialling the technology. Prospective clients also see the Mammalian Display part of OptiMAL\u00ae, which also offers best-in-class performance, to be well suited to other libraries. The Company is keen to exploit the platform for such additional libraries to complement the Opti-library application. Such libraries include AI/ML designed libraries and non-human libraries for diagnostics and veterinary medicine applications.\n\"So far as our existing platforms and offerings are concerned we have seen some very encouraging 'wins', especially for humanisation and cell line development. This has been achieved with a backdrop of challenging geopolitical and economic conditions which have slowed the progression of clients' funding and therefore their projects. I remain hopeful that as conditions improve, we will see a significant growth in outsourced projects as clients seek to rapidly start new projects to meet the growing demand for therapeutic and diagnostic antibodies.\n\"Whilst the recognised revenue for this period is down against the corresponding figure for H1 FY2025, it has increased against the immediately preceding six months (H2 FY2025) and reflects improving performance by the Company as well as being suggestive of a recovering market, one which Fusion is increasingly well placed to exploit.\"\nInvestor presentations\nFusion will host a presentation on the results open to all investors via the Investor Meet Company platform at 11.00am on Tuesday,\n25 November 2025\n, delivered by Dr Adrian Kinkaid, CEO and Stephen Smyth, Interim CFO.\nThe Company is committed to providing an opportunity for all existing and potential investors to hear directly from management on these results.\nI\nnvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet Fusion Antibodies plc via the following link:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/fusion-antibodies-plc/register-investor\nEnquiries:\nFusion Antibodies plc\nwww.fusionantibodies.com\nAdrian Kinkaid, Chief Executive Officer\nStephen Smyth, Chief Financial Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nFusion Antibodies interactive investor hub\nRegulatory news | Fusion Antibodies plc investor hub\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nJames Reeve/Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nTony Quirke/Joscelin Pinnington (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nShard Capital Partners LLP\nDamon Heath (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 207 186 9952\nWalbrook PR\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\u00a0fusion@walbrookpr.com\nAnna Dunphy\nMob: +44 (0)7876 741 001\nAbout Fusion Antibodies plc\nFusion Antibodies plc is a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) located in Northern Ireland that offers a integrated end-to-end range of antibody discovery, engineering and expression services for all stages of human therapeutic, veterinary therapeutic and diagnostic antibody development.\nThe range of services offered includes antibody discovery/generation, development, characterisation, optimisation, and small-scale production. In addition, the Company also offers antigen design, antigen expression, antibody purification and sequencing, antibody humanisation using Fusion's proprietary CDRxTM\u00a0platform and\u00a0cell line development, producing antibody generating stable cell lines optimised for use downstream by the customer to produce material for clinical trials. Since 2012,\u00a0the Company has successfully sequenced and expressed many thousands of antibodies and successfully completed over 290 humanisation projects for its international customer base, which has included eight of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies by revenue.\nAt every stage, our client's vision is central to how we work in\ncombining the latest technological advances with cutting edge science.\nIn this work our world-class discovery (\nOptiMAL\u00ae\nand OptiPhageTM), humanization and antibody optimization platforms harness the power of natural somatic hypermutation (SHM)\nto\nensure the best molecule goes to the clinic.\nFusion Antibodies' growth strategy is based on enabling Pharma and Biotech companies get to the clinic more effectively, using molecules with optimized therapeutic profile and enhanced potential for successful development and approval and, ultimately, on speeding up the drug discovery and development process. Our\nIntegrated Therapeutic Antibody Services (\"ITA\") offering enhances the efficiency of this process by providing a continuous service offering from as early as target nomination to as far as a stable cell line.\nFusion's use of SHM to create a fully human antibody library to capture the human antibody repertoire addresses a continuing market need in antibody discovery.\nFusion Antibodies' emphasis on antibody therapeutics is based on the size and growth rate in the sector, with the market valued at $253 billion in 2024 and forecast to reach nearly $500 billion by 2029. From 2020 to 2024 there have been 63 antibody therapeutics granted approval in either the USA or the EU, of which 30 were for cancer and there were nine antibodies each with sales of more than $5 billion in 2023.\nWhile therapeutic antibodies are our primary focus all the services are directly applicable to the Diagnostic sector and also the new, more embryonic veterinary markets and diversification into these markets gives the Company further growth opportunities.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nOperational Review\nThe first six months to 30 September 2025 have been exciting and challenging in equal measures. Exciting from the perspective of technical advances in OptiMAL\n\u00ae\nand the new grant for the co-development of the DR5 antibody, and challenging in terms of the global economic environment for the healthcare sector.\nIn April 2025, it was announced that Fusion Antibodies has secured a new grant in partnership with Queen's University Belfast (\"QUB\"), aiming to develop a humanised antibody specifically designed to target and activate the DR5 protein found on cancer cells. The principal objective of this collaboration is to produce a therapeutic asset that is ready for clinical use by the conclusion of the project, jointly owned by Fusion and QUB, and something that can then be licensed to third party pharma companies or Biotechs. The total funding available for this grant exceeds \u00a3808k, with the Company anticipating receipt of up to \u00a3545,000 over an estimated 18-month project period.\nOver the last six months\nOptiMAL\u00ae,\nhas been protected by the granting of the USA patent and generated some further very promising results from the NCI collaboration. On 5 August 2025, the OptiMAL\n\u00ae\npatent was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, covering the core library as well as the method for the design of additional libraries.\nThe Company is also progressing patent applications in respect of the OptiMAL\u00ae Library\nin several other territories including Europe, China and Japan.\nUsing the\nOptiMAL\u00ae\nlibrary, the NCI has been working on generating antibodies against three targets of interest and since the end of the last financial year we have reported that we have confirmed that for all three of their targets the antibodies produced from cells generated by the\nOptiMAL\u00ae\nscreening do bind to each of their respective targets. The first two were against cancer related proteins whereas the third, as announced on 3 November 2025 generated antibodies against a smaller peptide target. This broadens the applicability of OptiMAL\n\u00ae\nas peptides are often used as antigens as they are easier and more cost effective to synthesize. However, they are less immunogenic which in animal methods can result in poorer antibodies. This is not the case with OptiMAL\u00ae as no immune response is required.\nFully backed by independent validation of OptiMAL\u00ae for the isolation of specific antibodies against proteins and peptides we are on track for the commercial launch of OptiMAL\u00ae in December 2025.\nThe more challenging part of the last six months has been on the growth of the business. Revenues for the six-month period ending 30 September 2025 were \u00a30.84 million and down from H1 FY2025 (\u00a31.2 million). As reported previously revenue generating accounts can be lumpy throughout the year and amongst the smaller orders we have seen two very strong orders over the last six months. On\n27 August 2025, we announced that we had been selected to proceed with three follow on projects to the stable Cell Line Development project announced on 27 February 2025 under a collaborative research and development agreement with a US based biotechnology company. These new contracts build on the successful progress to date with the original project, extending its scope to include c. $460,000 of additional fees for Fusion, of which a minimum of $400,000 is expected to be recognised in the current financial year ending 31 March 2026. Furthermore, since the end of FY2025 we have also announced a\nnew humanisation project\nwith a US based specialty division of a global pharmaceutical company and announced a new multi-target\nIntegrated Therapeutic Antibody Services project\nwith the Antibody Centre of Excellence of a European-based global pharmaceutical company. These are seen significant parts of the Company's strategy of reducing dependence on more volatile smaller clients and demonstrates Fusion's ability to win contracts with 'Big Pharma' companies.\nThe Board continues to be optimistic about the prospects for the remainder of the current financial year and for growth into FY2027. Nevertheless, the Board remains prudently mindful of potential market volatility and the inherent science-based risks in any antibody-based discovery and development, whether human or veterinary, therapeutics or diagnostics.\nFinancial Review\nRevenues for H1 FY2026 were \u00a30.84 million (H1 FY2025: \u00a31.2 million). All revenues were for core services and contained no milestone payments.\nThe 30% gross profit percentage (H1 FY2025: 27%) was higher than in the same period last year due to the continued focus on cost savings, as well as utilisation of technical staff for R&D activities.\nR&D expenditure in H1 FY2026 was \u00a3350k, an increased level to the comparable period in FY2025 (H1 FY2025: \u00a3176k) reflecting the continuing investment, particularly in the OptiMAL\u00ae Library project, and the inception of two grant programmes.\nSG&A expenditure of \u00a3807k was \u00a3136k lower than in H1 FY2024 due primarily to business activity being lower than the comparative period.\nLoss for the period resulting from the above was \u00a3512k (H1 FY2025: \u00a3758k).\nCash used in operations was \u00a3567k, compared with \u00a3752k used in H1 FY2024. The H1 FY2025 operational outflow includes the \u00a3350k investment in R&D. The total net outflow was \u00a3107k and the closing cash balance at 30 September 2025 was \u00a3252k\nwith a further \u00a3543k owed from existing debtors\n.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) regularly reviewed by the Board are:\nKPI\nH1 FY2026\nH1 FY2025\nUnderlying revenue growth\n(30)%\n123%\nEBITDA*\n\u00a3(494k)\n(\u00a3734k)\nCash used in operations\n(\u00a3567k)\n(\u00a3752k)\n* Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation\nThe investment in R&D and the impact on EBITDA is set out in Note 12 to these statements. EBITDA for the period was a loss of \u00a3494k (H1 FY2025: \u00a3734k) and adjusting for research and development expenditure shows a significantly reduced EBITDA loss excluding R&D of \u00a3144k for the period (H1 FY2024: \u00a3558K).\nOutlook\nAs previously mentioned, Q3 has seen some further exciting OptiMAL\n\u00ae\nresults and the building of a good relationship with a big pharma client. The Company has continued to see an improvement in lead generation and pipeline value and continue to see increased value in adjacent markets such as Diagnostics. Margins improved over this time last year and continued efficiency improvements are also expected to contribute to further gains in margins. Cash continues to be well controlled, with cash at 21 November 2025 ahead of the period end, and the Board is confident that the prospects for the Company remain very encouraging.\nWe are looking forward to the launch of OptiMAL\n\u00ae\nat the\nAntibody Engineering and Therapeutics conference in San Diego in December 2025.\nHaving had a presence at several recent industry conferences, including ELRIG Drug Discovery, BIO Europe, PEGS Europe, we have received feedback from prospective clients with several expressing an interest in trialling the technology.\nWhilst these indications are at an early stage and will take several months to progress once OptiMAL\u00ae has been launched, the Board believes that the current value of the potential OptiMAL\u00ae/mammalian display pipeline is c. \u00a31 million.\nWe are also excited that NCI (part of the US National Institutes of Health) have the confidence in the performance of OptiMAL\n\u00ae\nto ask to extend its use of the OptiMAL\u00ae platform for use against further targets in the coming years. Negotiations are underway to establish mutually agreeable terms for an extended agreement.\nDr. Mitchell Ho, Deputy Chief, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute commented:\n\"\nThe OptiMAL\u00ae platform is performing very well in our hands. Using the library, we have isolated binders for multiple antigens in cancer, and my lab is currently evaluating their potential for cancer therapy and/or diagnostics.\"\nStatement of Directors' Responsibilities\nThe Directors confirm, to the best of their knowledge:\n\u00b7\nThe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\n\u00b7\nThe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year, and gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial positions and profit for the period of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nThe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, being a disclosure of related party transactions and changes therein since the previous annual report.\nOn behalf of the Board\nDr Simon Douglas\nNon-executive Chairman\n21 November 2025\nCondensed Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nNotes\n6 months to 30.09.25\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30.09.24\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31.03.25 Audited\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n838\n1,207\n1,965\nCost of sales\n(591)\n(882)\n(1,535)\nGross profit (loss)\n247\n325\n430\nOther operating income\n10\n370\n-\n-\nAdministrative expenses\n3\n(1,157)\n(1,119)\n(2,209)\nOperating loss\n(540)\n(794)\n(1,779)\nFinance income\n4\n2\n4\n5\nFinance costs\n4\n(10)\n(2)\n(3)\nLoss before tax\n(548)\n(792)\n(1,777)\nIncome tax credit\n5\n36\n34\n64\nLoss for the period\n(512)\n(758)\n(1,713)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(512)\n(758)\n(1,713)\nPence\nPence\nPence\nBasic loss per share\n6\n(0.5)\n(0.8)\n(1.8)\nCondensed Statement of Financial Position\nAs at 30 September 2025\nNotes\nAs at\n30.09.25\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nAs at\n30.09.24\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nAs at\n31.03.25\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment\n7\n420\n97\n63\n420\n97\n63\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n272\n230\n269\nTrade and other receivables\n868\n762\n632\nCurrent tax receivable\n-\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents\n252\n439\n359\n1,392\n1,431\n1,260\nTotal assets\n1,812\n1,528\n1,323\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n667\n417\n603\nBorrowings\n8\n105\n23\n20\n772\n440\n623\nNet current assets\n620\n990\n637\nNon-current liabilities\nBorrowings\n8\n283\n9\n-\nProvisions for liabilities\n31\n20\n31\nTotal liabilities\n1,086\n469\n654\nNet assets\n726\n1,059\n669\nEquity\nCalled up share capital\n12\n4,534\n3,815\n4,197\nShare premium reserve\n8,171\n7,743\n7,939\n(Accumulated losses)/retained earnings\n(11,979)\n(10,499)\n(11,467)\nEquity\n726\n1,059\n669\nCondensed Statement of Changes in Equity\nFor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n6 months ended 30 September 2025\nUnaudited\nCalled up share capital\n\u00a3'000\nShare premium reserve\n\u00a3'000\nAccumulated losses\n\u00a3'000\nTotal\nEquity\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2025\n4,197\n7,939\n(11,467)\n669\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n(512)\n(512)\nIssue of share capital\n337\n232\n-\n569\nShare options -

The financial information for the year ended 31 March 2025 does not constitute the full statutory accounts for that period. The Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The Independent Auditor's Report on the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 was unmodified and did not contain a statement under s498(2) or s498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. The Auditor's report contained a material uncertainty related to going concern.\nThe condensed financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the UK. The information in these condensed financial statements does not include all the information and disclosures made in the annual financial statements.\nGoing concern\nAt 30 September 2025 the Company had a cash balance of \u00a3252k and trade working capital balance of \u00a3473k. The Directors have reviewed detailed projections for the Company. These projections are based on estimates of future performance and have been adjusted to reflect various scenarios and outcomes that could potentially impact the forecast outturn. Based on these estimates, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the reporting date. Accordingly, they have prepared these condensed financial statements on the going concern basis.\nThe Directors note that there is inherent uncertainty in any cash flow forecast, however this is further exacerbated given the nature of the Company's trade and the industry in which it operates. Due to the risk that revenues and the related conversion of revenue to cash inflows may not be achieved as forecast over the going concern period, the Directors believe that there exists a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern without raising additional funds and it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThese financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\nAccounting policies\nThe condensed financial statements have been prepared in a manner consistent with the accounting policies set out in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 and on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the UK that the Company expects to be applicable at 31 March 2025. IFRS are subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n2 Segmental information\nFor all the financial periods included in these condensed financial statements, all the revenues and costs relate to the single operating segment of research, development and manufacture of recombinant proteins and antibodies.\n3 Administrative expenses\n6 months to 30.09.25\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30.09.24\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31.03.25\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\nResearch & development\n351\n176\n571\nSelling, general and administration\n806\n943\n1,638\n1,157\n1,119\n2,209\n4 Finance income and costs\nIncome\n6 months to 30.09.25\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30.09.24\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31.03.25\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\nBank interest receivable\n2\n4\n5\nExpense\n6 months to 30.09.25\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30.09.24\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31.03.25\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\nInterest expense on other borrowings\n10\n2\n3\n5 Income tax credit\n6 months to 30.09.25\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\n6 months to 30.09.24\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000\nYear to 31.03.25\nAudited\n\u00a3'000\nCurrent tax\n(36)\n(34)\n(64)\n6 Loss per share\n6 months to\n30.09.25\nUnaudited\nNumber\n6 months to\n30.09.24\nUnaudited\nNumber\nYear to\n31.03.25\nAudited\nNumber\nLoss for the financial year\n(512)\n(758)\n(1,713)\nLoss per share\npence\npence\npence\nBasic\n(0.5)\n(0.8)\n(1.8)\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the basic earnings for the period by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.\n6 months to\n30.09.25\nUnaudited\nNumber\n6 months to\n30.09.24\nUnaudited\nNumber\nYear to\n31.03.25\nAudited\nNumber\nIssued ordinary shares at the end of the period\n113,656,253\n95,365,564\n104,902,120\nWeighted average number of shares in issue during the period\n113,210,150\n95,365,564\n95,879,480\n7 Property, plant and equipment\nRight of use assets\n\u00a3'000\nLeasehold\nproperty\n\u00a3'000\nPlant &\nmachinery\n\u00a3'000\nFixtures, fittings & equipment\n\u00a3'000\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\nCost\nAt 1 April 2025\n14\n844\n2,393\n287\n3,538\nAdditions\n359\n-\n60\n-\n419\nDisposals\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAt 30 September 2025\n373\n844\n2,453\n287\n3,957\nAccumulated depreciation\nAt 1 April 2025\n14\n844\n2,347\n270\n3,475\nDepreciation charged in the period\n30\n-\n26\n6\n62\nAt 30 September 2025\n44\n844\n2,373\n276\n3,537\nNet book value\nAt 30 September 2025\n329\n-\n80\n10\n420\nAt 31 March 2025\n-\n-\n46\n17\n63\n8 Borrowings\nAt 30 September\n2025\n\u00a3'000\nAt 30 September\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nAt 31 March\n2025\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2025\n20\n43\n43\nAdditions in period\n400\n-\n-\nInterest\n8\n2\n3\nRepayments\n(40)\n(13)\n(26)\nAt period end\n388\n32\n20\nAmounts due in less than 1 year\n105\n23\n20\nAmounts due after more than 1 year\n283\n9\n-\n388\n32\n20\nBorrowings are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the whole undertaking of the Company, its property, assets and rights in favour of Northern Bank Ltd trading as Danske Bank.\n9 Retirement benefits obligations\nThe Company operates a defined contribution scheme, the assets of which are managed separately from the Company.\n10 Transactions with related parties\nThe Company had the following transactions with related parties during the period:\nInvest Northern Ireland is a shareholder in the Company.
