The Project will include humanisation and supply elements.\nHumanisation is the process required to make antibodies which were derived from non-human sequences, typically from mouse or rabbit antibodies, suitable for use as human therapeutics. Fusion will humanise a family of VHH antibody fragments for the Client. The Project also involves the expression, purification and supply of research materials.\nThe selection of Fusion for this Project again demonstrates the Company's ability to secure contracts with major pharmaceutical businesses. This is seen as a significant part of the Company's strategy of reducing dependence on more volatile smaller clients, but also in seeking to exploit the Company's novel technologies such as OptiMAL\u00ae.\nThis will hopefully drive sustainable growth, strengthen market positioning and open further new commercial opportunities.\nWork in relation to the Project is expected to be completed within the current financial year and the Company expects to generate revenues of not less than \u00a3175,000.\nAdrian Kinkaid, CEO of Fusion, said:\n\"We are delighted to have been selected to humanise a family of VHH antibody fragments for our Client. It is particularly gratifying that a client of this magnitude and recognised expertise, with all the resources available to them, has selected Fusion to undertake this critical work. It reflects both our position as providers of world-class antibody engineering services\nand our ability to deliver innovative, high-quality solutions for long-lasting partnerships\n.

Unaudited gross margin for the period was 29%, compared to -16% in the first half of the prior year, showing significant progress against our targets. Cash as at 30 September 2024 was \u00a3464k and is tracking in line with management's expectations.\n\"During the period, the Company expanded its collaboration agreement with the National Cancer Institute (\"NCI\") to include the humanisation by Fusion of several of the NCI's existing camelid nanobodies. A new contract was secured to develop an antibody based therapeutic with a US based biotechnology company and we entered into a contract to develop a bespoke OptiPhageTM library. In addition, we have strengthened our investor and stakeholder engagement through launch of a new interactive investor hub at investorhub.fusionantibodies.com.\n\"Cash continues to be carefully controlled and, as set out in the Company's FY24 results announced on 5 September 2024, based on internal estimates the Company has a cash runway into the second half of FY26. The Company continues to seek to achieve cash neutrality during that timeframe and has no plans to raise cash through an equity placement. We remain on track and on plan with our strategic goals.
