Gross margins have been increased and general expenses reduced, as\nthe Company continues to restructure and adjust cross disciplinary policies to its new strategy focus on the shipping container market.\nThe Company is focusing on its priority shipping container market, leveraging cutting-edge technology to maintain a distinct advantage within the industry. The Company's recent announcement, on 5 February 2024, of its agreement\nwith\na leading provider of end-to-end goods management services evidences the Company's success in innovation and market leadership. Furthermore, the Company continues its proactive approach to addressing industry challenges, for example the integration of cutting-edge technology to resolve communication issues through its collaboration with Sateliot IOT, announced in December 2023. In addition, optimization solutions for power consumption represent another facet of the Company's commitment to technological advancement and sustainability.\nThe Board remains confident in the Company's technological capabilities and the value of the Company's supply chain tracking solutions. Furthermore, strategic collaborations with leading players in the shipping container market provide the Company with valuable insights into market demand and the opportunities for commercial partnerships, as the Company seeks to secure additional long-term agreements with its diverse client base.\nCLN extension update\nFurther to its announcements on 20 December 2023 and 17 January 2024, the Company announces that it has entered into an agreement (\"Agreement\") for the extension of the maturity date of the \u00a3925,000 unsecured convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") until 20 January 2025. Under the Agreement the following terms have been agreed with the holders of the CLNs (\"Lenders\"):\n\u00b7\nCoupon: the interest payable on the CLNs shall be 10% per annum, commencing from 1 January 2024.\n\u00b7\nConversion: the Lenders will have the right to convert, at their discretion, the principal amount of the CLNs into such number of T42 shares (\"Conversion Shares\") corresponding to 28.82% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital immediately following the date of conversion, if the aggregate principal amount is converted, and into a pro-rata number of Conversion Shares in case of a partial conversion. The Lenders shall not issue a conversion notice if this would result in a breach of Rule 9 of the UK Takeover Code.\n\u00b7\nAnti-Dilution: the Agreement includes anti-dilution provisions to protect the equity interest percentage of the Lenders, so that in the event of the exercise or conversion of existing warrants, options or other instruments convertible into new t42 ordinary shares (subject to certain exceptions), the Lenders will be issued for no additional consideration such number of t42 shares such that, together with the t42 shares already held, each Lender's percentage shareholding shall remain the same. Under these provisions (and the similar provisions in the convertible loan from Ewave Mobile Ltd (\"Ewave\") in July 2023), a maximum of up to approximately 84.27 million additional new shares would be issued to the Lenders and Ewave. In light of this, the Company expects to propose, at its forthcoming AGM, relevant increased share authorities.\n\u00b7\nSecurity: security is provided by way of parent guarantee and fixed and floating charges over the assets of t42. The floating charge ranks pari-passu with the floating charge provided to Ewave under the Ewave loan and the fixed charge security over the intellectual property rights of t42 is second ranking, subordinated only to the fixed charge in favor of Ewave under the Ewave loan.\n\u00b7\nConversion/Repayment Events: in the event of certain major transactions or financing investments the lender may elect for conversion or repayment of the CLNs.\n\u00b7\nCancellation of warrants: the 1,541,667 outstanding 3-year warrants granted to the Lenders in December 2021 have been cancelled.\nIn conjunction with the Agreement, the Company has also entered into an addendum to the loan agreement with Ewave Mobile Ltd, announced on 26 July 2023, pursuant to which they have consented to the CLN extension and will also have the same conversion rights as the CLN holders in the event of a major transaction.\nAvi Hartmann, CEO of t42, commented\n: \"We are thrilled about the promising future ahead for the Company. Our sustained focus on long-term strategies, coupled with our technological edge and deep client collaborations, paves the way for continued success. With our innovative solutions and commitment to excellence, we are poised to thrive and lead in our industry.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman\n07785 727595\nAvi Hartmann, CEO +972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\n020 7409 3494\nJames Harris/ Richard Johnson/ Robert Collins\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n020 7469 0930\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey/Eran Zucker\nNotes to Editors\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions plc\n(AIM: TRAC), formerly Starcom Systems plc, provides real-time tracking, analysis, monitoring, and security IoT solutions for the global container and freight market and covers 55 countries, over 100 distributors, and 50 logistics and support partners.\nt42's multi-sensor IoT tracking devices use a wide range of detection capabilities with cloud-based analytics and alerts, with real-time data transmission, analysis, and actionable insights.

Shipments of Lokies more than doubled compared to the previous year, and this trend has already extended into early 2025. Customers are providing encouraging expectations for continued demand, particularly in Latin America and the U.S., where t42 has been actively expanding its market presence.\nAll contracts signed and announced during 2024 are progressing in their deployment, albeit at a slightly slower pace than initially forecasted. Nevertheless, they are expected to be completed within the agreed timeframe and are anticipated to generate a greater impact throughout 2025. Customer expectations remain on track to be fulfilled over the course of the respective agreement periods. The only exception is the contract in Brazil announced on 13 May 2024, which may experience a minor delay due to ongoing commercial developments; however, its first phase has already been completed.\nThe Kylos device was upgraded in both hardware and software during 2024, with increased demand now observed in Latin America and Europe. Long-standing customers are expanding into new markets, demonstrating the growing trust and reliance on t42's solutions.\nIn fleet management, our Helios platform is finding success in niche applications where our technological edge outperforms pricing concerns. A major Latin American project, announced in December 2024, has positioned t42 as a national platform provider, with thousands of additional units projected for deployment in 2025 and beyond.\nAt a strategic level, t42 continues to collaborate closely with global shipping leaders to deliver tailored, innovative solutions. Despite sector challenges, our resilience, market insight, and growing reputation position us for transformative growth starting in 2025.\nStrategic Outlook: From Reactive to Proactive Growth\nStarting in 2025, t42 has undergone a fundamental shift-from passively responding to market demands to actively pursuing strategic growth opportunities. We are now positioning ourselves at the forefront of targeted industries, forging high-value partnerships, and aligning our solutions with the evolving needs of global customers.\nThis proactive approach is already delivering tangible results, with a growing portfolio of high-impact projects and deeper integration with logistics and infrastructure leaders worldwide.\nKey Strategic Growth Targets for 2025 and Beyond\n\u00b7\nExpansion into governmental fleet management programs offering long-term revenue stability\n\u00b7\nMulti-year, multi-million-dollar contracts with logistics and cargo security market leaders\n\u00b7\nPenetration into high-growth regions in Africa, South America, and Western Europe\n\u00b7\nCollaboration with AI and tech partners to deliver full-stack intelligence and security solutions\n\u00b7\nIncreasing interest for Lokies and Helios M in sectors such as ATM security, fuel station monitoring, and customs tracking\nOur financial pipeline for 2025 and beyond includes several potential projects and opportunities with annual revenue potential in the multi-million-dollar range and we are committed to converting these opportunities into firm orders. With long-term contracts secured, and an increasing demand for tailored IoT solutions, t42 is well-positioned to accelerate and sustain growth across multiple verticals.\nPersonnel Update -\nVP Sales\nt42 is pleased to have welcomed Shachar Rosiansky as the new Vice President of Sales and Marketing at the beginning of the year. Shachar brings nearly two decades of experience in the tech industry, with a focus on software-driven hardware companies and a track record of leading complex, high-impact projects across global markets. Since joining, Shachar has had a tangible impact with several recent strategic wins and projects stemming from his proactive approach, strong market connections, and execution. His marketing leadership is expected to further accelerate t42's growth trajectory as we expand into new geographies and sectors.\nBoard Change - Chief Financial Officer\nChief Financial Officer (CFO), Igor Vatenmacher, has informed the Company of his intention to step down from his position as CFO with immediate effect to pursue an opportunity with a new company. The search for a replacement has begun and in the interim Igor will remain on the Board in a non-executive position to support the transition period. The Company will provide an update in due course, once a new candidate has been identified.\nConvertible Loan Notes\nDiscussions with the holders of the Company's two outstanding convertible loan notes, which are due to mature on 20 May 2025, are progressing. Various options are being considered and we will provide an update in due course.\nAvi Hartmann, CEO of t42, commented:\n\"t42 has established a solid foundation, and we now look ahead with confidence to significant market opportunities. Our continued investment in innovation, strategic partnerships, and global expansion positions us for strong growth. The increasing demand for our solutions, combined with our ability to adapt and lead in a dynamic industry, fills us with great optimism for the future. We enter 2025 with strong momentum and are excited about the long-term value we are creating for our customers, partners, and investors.\n\"The Board wishes to express its sincere gratitude and appreciation for Igor's invaluable contributions during his tenure and wishes him success in his future endeavours.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman 07785 727595\nAvi Hartmann, CEO +972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\n020 7409 3494\nJames Harris/ Richard Johnson/ Robert Collins\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n020 7469 0930\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey/Eran Zucker\nNotes to Editors\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions plc (AIM: TRAC), formerly Starcom Systems plc, provides real-me tracking, analysis, monitoring, and security IoT solutions for the global container and freight market and covers 55 countries, over 100 distributors, and 50 logistics and support partners.\nt42's multi-sensor IoT tracking devices use a wide range of detection capabilities with cloud-based analysis and alerts, with real-me data transmission, analysis, and actionable insights.
