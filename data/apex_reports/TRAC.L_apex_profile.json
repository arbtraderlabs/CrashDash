We have deferred both convertible loans to the end of 2027, with one of them already being repaid in instalments until then. This step enhances our financial flexibility and supports sustainable growth.

A portion of the revenue will be recognised in the current year, making a meaningful contribution to our 2025 results, while the majority will be realised in 2026, contributing to a year in which we anticipate further substantial growth. Importantly, all purchases under this contract are paid in advance, delivering a positive impact on our cash flow and supporting our growth strategy.\nStrong Growth in Lokies Sales\nOne of the clearest indicators of the transformation underway is the growth in Lokies sales. In the first half of 2024, we sold 1,800 units. In the first half of 2025, sales rose sharply to 5,000 units - almost a threefold increase. This not only drives immediate hardware revenue but also lays the foundation for ongoing SaaS subscription income.\nLoan Extensions - Strengthening Financial Flexibility\nTowards the end of the first half, we signed two important agreements with our principal lenders:\n1.\n\u00a30.925 million CLN\n- Loan repayment postponed until the end of 2027, with monthly capital and interest repayments. Several payments have already been completed under the new terms.\n2.\n$1.35 million CLN\n- Loan repayment similarly postponed until the end of 2027, with interest payments only.\nThese extension agreements allow additional resources to be channeled into business investment.\nAccelerated Product Development - Expanding the Portfolio\nWe continued to invest in complementary products for the supply chain market:\n1.\nKylos M\n- A compact tracking solution for boxes, pallets, and trailers. Following a successful pilot, the product is now available for commercial sales with strong demand.\n2.\nKylos Solar\n- Designed for rail freight a",

We are pleased to note that over 75% of 2024 revenues were generated from products in the shipping container market.\nWhile headline revenues remained consistent with 2023, the Company is now seeing clear indicators of strong growth ahead. Increasing momentum in sales of our flagship Lokies and Tetis technologies, along with other IoT offerings, is expected to drive substantial performance improvements beginning in 2025.\n* FY 2024 figures subject to completion of audit process\nOperational Highlights & Market Momentum\nt42 continued its strategic focus on the global shipping container market throughout 2024. Shipments of Lokies more than doubled compared to the previous year, and this trend has already extended into early 2025. Customers are providing encouraging expectations for continued demand, particularly in Latin America and the U.S., where t42 has been actively expanding its market presence.\nAll contracts signed and announced during 2024 are progressing in their deployment, albeit at a slightly slower pace than initially forecasted. Nevertheless, they are expected to be completed within the agreed timeframe and are anticipated to generate a greater impact throughout 2025. Customer expectations remain on track to be fulfilled over the course of the respective agreement periods. The only exception is the contract in Brazil announced on 13 May 2024, which may experience a minor delay due to ongoing commercial developments; however, its first phase has already been completed.\nThe Kylos device was upgraded in both hardware and software during 2024, with increased demand now observed in Latin America and Europe. Long-standing customers are expanding into new markets, demonstrating the growing trust and reliance on t42's solutions.\nIn fleet management, our Helios platform is finding success in niche applications where our technological edge outperforms pricing concerns. A major Latin American project, announced in December 2024, has positioned t42 as a national platform provider, with thousands of additional units projected for deployment in 2025 and beyond.\nAt a strategic level, t42 continues to collaborate closely with global shipping leaders to deliver tailored, innovative solutions. Despite sector challenges, our resilience, market insight, and growing reputation position us for transformative growth starting in 2025.\nStrategic Outlook: From Reactive to Proactive Growth\nStarting in 2025, t42 has undergone a fundamental shift-from passively responding to market demands to actively pursuing strategic growth opportunities. We are now positioning ourselves at the forefront of targeted industries, forging high-value partnerships, and aligning our solutions with the evolving needs of global customers.\nThis proactive approach is already delivering tangible results, with a growing portfolio of high-impact projects and deeper integration with logistics and infrastructure leaders worldwide.\nKey Strategic Growth Targets for 2025 and Beyond\n\u00b7\nExpansion into governmental fleet management programs offering long-term revenue stability\n\u00b7\nMulti-year, multi-million-dollar contracts with logistics and cargo security market leaders\n\u00b7\nPenetration into high-growth regions in Africa, South America, and Western Europe\n\u00b7\nCollaboration with AI and tech partners to deliver full-stack intelligence and security solutions\n\u00b7\nIncreasing interest for Lokies and Helios M in sectors such as ATM security, fuel station monitoring, and customs tracking\nOur financial pipeline for 2025 and beyond includes several potential projects and opportunities with annual revenue potential in the multi-million-dollar range and we are committed to converting these opportunities into firm orders. With long-term contracts secured, and an increasing demand for tailored IoT solutions, t42 is well-positioned to accelerate and sustain growth across multiple verticals.\nPersonnel Update -\nVP Sales\nt42 is pleased to have welcomed Shachar Rosiansky as the new Vice President of Sales and Marketing at the beginning of the year. Shachar brings nearly two decades of experience in the tech industry, with a focus on software-driven hardware companies and a track record of leading complex, high-impact projects across global markets.

The recent extension of both CLN facilities for an additional four months, under unchanged terms, enhances our financial flexibility to support ongoing growth. Our focus on improving product performance, particularly in energy efficiency, continues to resonate with clients and adds substantial value to their operations.

Total revenues reached $2.0 million, up from $1.7 million in H1 2023. We expect to fulfill orders under the agreements announced earlier this year during the remainder of the second half. The gross margin for the period remained stable at 45%, compared to 48% last year. We continue to deliver on these agreements, along with additional long-term and ad-hoc orders, with a strong focus on the shipping container market.\nA few years ago, we made a significant strategic shift within the Company, transitioning our focus from vehicle tracking systems to container tracking and monitoring solutions. This transformation not only led to the rebranding of the Company to t42 but also marked a fundamental change in our core business. We successfully retained our excellent team, while at the same time, we developed new products, identified new customers, and built innovative revenue models.\nIn a short period, we have demonstrated that we are on the right track, and the upward trend is clearly reflected in our results. In the container market segment we experienced significant growth in H1 2024, with new supply agreements, for orders in 2024 and the following two years, surpassing the total sales achieved in 2023. This remarkable momentum is a clear reflection of the exceptional quality of our Lokies smart locks, and the enthusiastic reception received in the market. Demand continues to grow, positioning us for even greater success by year-end.\nWe have invested considerable effort in the development and performance improvement of our products, and we have successfully reduced the energy consumption of the locks by a significant amount. This enhancement means customers need to charge the locks less frequently, providing significant logistical benefits and added value to our clients.\nThis positive trend continues to strengthen. More and more customers are being introduced to our monitoring solutions, additional pilots are underway, and the existing market potential is converting into tangible business deals. Moreover, we remain committed to investing in our complementary product, Tetis, where we have also focused on improving energy efficiency.A significant part of this growth can be seen in the new supply agre",

The agreement sets out a phased deployment of t42's advanced tracking devices across a substantial segment of the end-user client's Mexican transportation fleet. A first order has been received for approximately $80k and, following installation of these initial units, the next hardware order is expected to be for a value of approximately $0.5m.\nThe client is Mexico's leading petrol and diesel transportation cooperative organisation, responsible for over 60% of all petrol and diesel transportation and storage in Mexico.\nMexico has the second highest number of traffic fatalities in Latin America which is estimated to have negatively impact annual GDP by 1.7% (over $17bn losses) in 2022.\nThe client had previously sought to have tracking solutions installed however, due to complexities with the installation process and an inability to upgrade, this was not a viable solution at that time. T42, along with its local partner in Mexico, submitted an NRE (non-recurring engineering) proposal for a new product based on a single solution combining both speed limiters and vehicles fleet management. Following several months of development, t42 produced a completely new product, and has completed a 12 month trial implementation of the t42 solution. The client has reported a significant outcome: zero accidents and a 100% success rate in preventing incidents that would have previously led to significant losses and insurance claims.\nAvi Hartmann, CEO of t42, commented:\n\"This is yet further proof that t42 is at the frontline of technological advancements in the tracking solutions space. Our ability to innovate and develop around the client's requirements has allowed us to secure this new order and is expected to bring in future additional orders where solutions are evaluated by quality rather than price alone.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael\nRosenberg, Chairman\n07785 727595\nAvi Hartmann, CEO\n+972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\n020 7409 3494\nJames Harris/ Richard Johnson/ Robert Collins\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n020 7469 0930\nLucy Williams/ Charles Goodfellow/ Eran Zucker\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions plc\n(AIM: TRAC), formerly Starcom Systems plc, provides real-time tracking, analysis, monitoring, and security IoT solutions for the global container and freight market and covers 55 countries, over 100 distributors, and 50 logistics and support partners.\nt42's multi-sensor IoT tracking devices use a wide range of detection capabilities with cloud-based analytics and alerts, with real-time data transmission, analysis, and actionable insights.

Gross margins have been increased and general expenses reduced, as\nthe Company continues to restructure and adjust cross disciplinary policies to its new strategy focus on the shipping container market.\nThe Company is focusing on its priority shipping container market, leveraging cutting-edge technology to maintain a distinct advantage within the industry. The Company's recent announcement, on 5 February 2024, of its agreement\nwith\na leading provider of end-to-end goods management services evidences the Company's success in innovation and market leadership. Furthermore, the Company continues its proactive approach to addressing industry challenges, for example the integration of cutting-edge technology to resolve communication issues through its collaboration with Sateliot IOT, announced in December 2023. In addition, optimization solutions for power consumption represent another facet of the Company's commitment to technological advancement and sustainability.\nThe Board remains confident in the Company's technological capabilities and the value of the Company's supply chain tracking solutions. Furthermore, strategic collaborations with leading players in the shipping container market provide the Company with valuable insights into market demand and the opportunities for commercial partnerships, as the Company seeks to secure additional long-term agreements with its diverse client base.\nCLN extension update\nFurther to its announcements on 20 December 2023 and 17 January 2024, the Company announces that it has entered into an agreement (\"Agreement\") for the extension of the maturity date of the \u00a3925,000 unsecured convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") until 20 January 2025. Under the Agreement the following terms have been agreed with the holders of the CLNs (\"Lenders\"):\n\u00b7\nCoupon: the interest payable on the CLNs shall be 10% per annum, commencing from 1 January 2024.\n\u00b7\nConversion: the Lenders will have the right to convert, at their discretion, the principal amount of the CLNs into such number of T42 shares (\"Conversion Shares\") corresponding to 28.82% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital immediately following the date of conversion, if the aggregate principal amount is converted, and into a pro-rata number of Conversion Shares in case of a partial conversion. The Lenders shall not issue a conversion notice if this would result in a breach of Rule 9 of the UK Takeover Code.\n\u00b7\nAnti-Dilution: the Agreement includes anti-dilution provisions to protect the equity interest percentage of the Lenders, so that in the event of the exercise or conversion of existing warrants, options or other instruments convertible into new t42 ordinary shares (subject to certain exceptions), the Lenders will be issued for no additional consideration such number of t42 shares such that, together with the t42 shares already held, each Lender's percentage shareholding shall remain the same. Under these provisions (and the similar provisions in the convertible loan from Ewave Mobile Ltd (\"Ewave\") in July 2023), a maximum of up to approximately 84.27 million additional new shares would be issued to the Lenders and Ewave. In light of this, the Company expects to propose, at its forthcoming AGM, relevant increased share authorities.\n\u00b7\nSecurity: security is provided by way of parent guarantee and fixed and floating charges over the assets of t42. The floating charge ranks pari-passu with the floating charge provided to Ewave under the Ewave loan and the fixed charge security over the intellectual property rights of t42 is second ranking, subordinated only to the fixed charge in favor of Ewave under the Ewave loan.\n\u00b7\nConversion/Repayment Events: in the event of certain major transactions or financing investments the lender may elect for conversion or repayment of the CLNs.\n\u00b7\nCancellation of warrants: the 1,541,667 outstanding 3-year warrants granted to the Lenders in December 2021 have been cancelled.\nIn conjunction with the Agreement, the Company has also entered into an addendum to the loan agreement with Ewave Mobile Ltd, announced on 26 July 2023, pursuant to which they have consented to the CLN extension and will also have the same conversion rights as the CLN holders in the event of a major transaction.\nAvi Hartmann",

Under the Agreement, the customer (\"\nCustomer\"\n), which provides cutting-edge IoT and AI solutions for monitoring goods in the supply chain, has agreed to place orders for up to 30,000 'Lokies' units over the next three years, together with associated Software as a Service (SaaS) fees, which if received and deployed would be estimated to deliver revenues of over $7.5 million to the Company, although there is no guarantee of the total number or timing of ordering of units, nor revenues to be derived from, the Agreement.\nFollowing the initial agreement (which is being superseded by this Agreement) in January 2023, under which the Company has successfully delivered 2,000 'Lokies' tracking units along with additional other products and services, the demonstrated effectiveness of 'Lokies' units in safeguarding goods and ensuring the integrity of worldwide deliveries has led to this significant new and expanded agreement with the Customer, with an immediate despatch to satisfy the first order of 1,000 units. The Agreement represents a strategic shift for t42, furthering its focus on the global container and supply chain market and is expected to provide a steady stream of recurring revenue throughout the period of use.\nAfter a detailed evaluation of development requirements and a thorough assessment of the Company's capabilities, the Company is pleased to announce this agreement, which provides for further development and updates of 'Lokies' and positions the Company to supply the Customer and its end-users with more efficient, cutting-edge solutions.\n'Lokies' stands out as a unique, smart keyless padlock, with innovative IoT capabilities. It integrates advanced Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and cellular technology, complemented by the latest Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity and sophisticated user management abilities. 'Lokies' enables customers to identify and manage various users based on their access authorisations. This feature significantly enhances cargo visibility and security, making it a key tool in modern logistics and supply chain management.\nThe Customer, a leading provider in the realm of end-to-end goods management services, utilises advanced AI models to deliver comprehensive shipment data and business intelligence services. This sophisticated approach enables the effective management of supply chains, offering unparalleled insights and operational efficiencies. Their expertise in integrating cutting-edge technology into logistics processes underscores the strategic importance of their partnership with the Company.\nCLN extension update\nAs previously announced the Company is negotiating with the holders of the 2021 unsecured convertible loan notes (\"CLN\") with a view to extending the maturity date and other amendments. There are several different investors in the CLN and, while the Company believes that all are supportive of the extension, it is taking longer than originally anticipated to complete the necessary legal arrangements. A further update will be provided when an agreement is entered into.\nAvi Hartmann, CEO of t42, commented\n: \"t42 is witnessing the tangible impact of its long-term efforts to integrate cutting-edge solutions within the supply chain industry. There is a notable global surge in interest for 'Lokies' and the associated comprehensive t42 solution, which is expected to be positively reflected in the Company's financial results in 2024 and beyond.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman\n07785 727595\nAvi Hartmann, CEO\n+972 5447 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\n020 7409 3494\nJames Harris/ Richard Johnson/ Robert Collins\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n020 7469 0930\nLucy Williams/ Charles Goodfellow/ Eran Zucker\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions plc\n(AIM: TRAC), formerly Starcom Systems plc, provides real-time tracking, analysis, monitoring, and security IoT solutions for the global container and freight market and covers 55 countries, over 100 distributors, and 50 logistics and support partners.\nt42's multi-sensor IoT tracking devices use a wide range of detection capabilities with cloud-based analytics and alerts, with real-time data transmission, analysis, and actionable insights.

(\"Sateliot\"), based in Barcelona, the first company to operate a Low-Earth orbit (LEO) 5G IoT satellite constellation, are pleased to announce that the parties have agreed to collaborate to boost their connected containers offerings.\nt42 intends to incorporate 5G-IoT communication modules into its existing and future devices deployed in containers for its more than 50 logistics partners across the Globe, connecting them to Sateliot's satellites, thus eliminating the problem of lack of coverage on the high seas. This will ensure secure control of merchandise at all times, as these modules monitor location, acceleration, temperature, humidity, impacts, tilt, light conditions, and container damage, among other parameters, providing intelligent detection of these variables anytime, anywhere. Positioned at the forefront of technological innovation, t42 consistently spearheads advancements in the dynamic landscape of the IoT market. The Company's commitment extends to leading the charge in revolutionising the tracking and monitoring of shipping containers. By seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technologies, we empower businesses to thrive in the fast-evolving global container and freight market.\nCurrently, a significant majority of maritime transport containers are not tracked or inspected due to a lack of cellular and satellite connectivity, leading to losses from cargo theft, tampering, accidents, damages, etc. In response, shipping companies are allocating significant capital to address this, targeting to make 25% of their containers 'smart' by 2026. Furthermore, maritime companies handle 80% of international trade goods by volume. It is estimated that shipping companies could save many billions of euros annually by transitioning to smart connected containers.\nSateliot's unique technology allows extending 5G NarrowBand-IoT connectivity to any part of the world without terrestrial coverage, without operators having to change their hardware, and at a low cost. The significance of this technology lies in the premise that operators can connect to the nanosatellite network via a roaming service when they need to extend their coverage. Furthermore, the low cost per device and connection is an added advantage driving this innovation.\nThe combination of Sateliot's technology and t42's hardware is an opportunity to revolutionise a sector that has mostly stayed the same since Malcolm McLean invented the shipping container in 1956.\nBack then, the revolutionary solution came from the new standardised way of shipping goods, with a newly designed container perfectly shaped to fit all ships, tools, and ports. Now, the Company believes, a second revolution is in process with the new 5G standard for IoT communications capable of connecting devices seamlessly to satellite (NTN) and cellular networks.\nJaume Sanpera, Sateliot's CEO, said\n: \"Our collaboration marks a pivotal moment in the industry's history, transforming traditional shipping containers into intelligent, connected assets. Tracking in open seas, until now, a very luxurious satellite service will be democratised to all.\"\nAvi Hartmann, t42's CEO, added\n: \"It is unbelievable what a small hardware investment can represent for the industry's performance overall. This change has come to stay; there's no doubt about it and t42 has positioned itself to be a leader in this change over the next few years.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman\nAvi Hartmann, CEO\n07785 727595\n+972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\nJames Harris/ Richard Johnson/ Robert Collins\n020 7409 3494\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nLucy Williams/Charles Goodfellow/Eran Zucker\n020 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

We now take on the challenge of financing the increasing demand for our products using the Company's new leasing structure. At the same time it is clear that we are becoming an increasingly important player in the shipping container tracking solutions market.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions Plc\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman\nAvi Hartmann, CEO\n07785 727595\n+972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial\nAdviser)\nJames Harris / Richard Johnson / Robert Collins\n020 7409 3494\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nLucy Williams / Charles Goodfellow / Eran Zucker\n020 7469 0930\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information pursuant to Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 as amended.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nWe are pleased to report the unaudited results of t42 for the half year ended 30 June 2023 (\"H1 2023\").\nTotal revenues were $1.7m (H1 2022: $2.2m), due to the effects of continued supply chain issues, together with supplier requirements for upfront payments, which has impacted our ability to complete many orders in the first half of this year. We hope to fulfil these orders in the remainder of the second half of the year. The gross margin for the period showed an improvement on the previous year to 48% compared to 46%, with an operational loss prior to financing costs (including exchange rate impacts) of $0.5m (H1 2022: $0.5m). As already indicated in previous statements, the results for this year are expected to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year based on our expectations from the existing potential order pipeline. Anticipated orders give management confidence that the results for the second half of 2023 will show a significant improvement on 2022 full year results.\nPost-period, as announced on 26 July 2023, we successfully raised $1.3m through a convertible loan provided by Ewave Mobile Ltd. The loan, which carries an interest of 10%, has enabled us to pay off the existing $0.55m loan from CSS Alpha Global Pte Ltd which had a substantially higher interest rate . Ewave Mobile Ltd. is an international group providing solutions across a range of sectors including supply chain management. We hope to develop new business opportunities from this relationship.\nDuring H1 2023, sales of Tetis and Lokies represented 34% and 25% of hardware revenues respectively, compared to 3% and 19% for the corresponding period in the previous year, demonstrating the success of the Company's new focus on the more profitable shipping and freight sectors, while sales of Helios represented 38% of Company revenue (H1 2022: 70%).\nWe are in regular contact with the distributors in Latin America, announced in December 2021 and July 2022. Whilst minimal sales have been achieved through these channels to date, based on discussions with the distributors, we continue to anticipate that more substantial orders will be forthcoming as we seek to gain traction in these important markets. As recently updated, the distribution contract with OpenBox has not delivered any sales and although we remain in contact with them, we are not anticipating any major sales from them in the near future; as they do not currently have exclusivity in the USA, this has allowed us to progress other opportunities in the USA through alternative channels. Consequently, we signed a contract with another\nUS-based, leading global company which provides a unified view of in-transit logistics to detect and correct non-compliance within supply chains, which,",

The funding is in the form of a secured convertible loan (\"\nLoan\n\") provided to t42 Limited by Ewave Mobile Ltd.) (\"\nLender\n\"), an international group providing solutions across a range of sectors, including supply chain management. Companies within Lender's group have been long-time key customers of t42 in the supply chain market.\nThe Loan, which carries interest at 10% per annum, payable quarterly on the principal drawn, will be drawn down as to $600,000 immediately, $300,000 in three equal tranches during August 2023, and the balance of $300,000 by 30 September 2023.\nThe Company will apply approximately $0.55 million of the Loan to repay in full the outstanding loan from CSS Alpha Global Pte Ltd\n(\"CSS\")\n, together with interest accrued, which was announced on 15 December 2022 and carried a substantially higher interest rate compared to the new Loan.\nThe remaining funds from the Loan are anticipated to assist the Company in advancing several pending orders by supporting the upfront payment to suppliers and the new financing leasing structure for other existing orders, and to support taking advantage of the expected growth in business opportunities during 2023.\nThe Loan, together with accrued interest at the time of conversion, may be converted, at the discretion of the Lender, at any time prior to the Loan repayment date of 20 January 2025, into such number of new t42 ordinary shares as corresponds to 29.5% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital immediately following such conversion. The Loan may be converted in part, on a pro rata basis to the above terms.\nBased on the Company's current issued share capital, being 54,026,822 ordinary shares, and prevailing exchange rates, the conversion rate corresponds to approximately\n4.4\n6p per new t42 ordinary share and full conversion would result in the issue of 22,606,968 shares.\nFor so long as (i) the Loan is outstanding, or (ii) the Lender holds 15% or more of the Company's issued ordinary shares, the Lender shall have the right to appoint a director or observer to the t42 Board. The appointment of such director shall be subject to completion of customary satisfactory regulatory due diligence by the Company's nominated adviser.\nSecurity is provided by way of parent guarantee and charges over the assets of t42. The Loan agreement includes anti-dilution provisions to protect the equity interest percentage of the Lender, so that in the event of the exercise or conversion of existing warrants, options or other instruments convertible into new t42 ordinary shares (subject to certain exceptions), the Lender will be issued for no additional consideration such number of t42 shares such that, together with the t42 shares already held, the Lender's percentage shareholding shall remain the same. Under these provisions, a maximum of 9,061,870 additional new shares would be issued to the Lender, assuming full exercise or conversion of existing warrants, options and convertible securities (save for a limited number of dilutive instruments excluded from this calculation).\nIn the event the Loan is converted and the Lender's resultant shareholding exceeds 20% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital, the Lender shall enter into a relationship agreement with the Company and its Nominated Adviser on customary terms.\nConfirmation of Total Voting Rights\nThe Company notes that the 3 million Deposit Shares, as detailed in the announcement of 15 December 2022, are now not being issued to CSS. Therefore, as of the date hereof there are 54,026,822 ordinary shares in issue, each with one voting right. The Company does not hold any ordinary shares in treasury. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nAvi Hartmann, CEO of t42, commented\n: \"We have full confidence in our new lease-based business model, which we believe will help us grow and expand our business even further. The funds raised will enable us to deliver new orders to our customers more efficiently and enhance our service quality. We look forward to increased commercial cooperation between the parties in line with our common strategies.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman\nAvi Hartmann, CEO\n07785 727595\n+972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\nJame",

Its devices are used by ports, cargo owners, shipping companies, freight forwarders, insurance companies, customs authorities, homeland security, and police for end-to-end global container tracking and digital transformation of shipments.\nThe Annual Report will be made available to shareholders shortly and be available from the Company\u00d5s website at:\nwww.t42.co.uk/\n.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nWe are pleased to report the audited results of t42 for the year ended 31 December 2022: revenues were $4.04m (2021: $ 4.21m), gross margin was 42% (2021: 40%), and net losses after tax were reduced to $1.01m (2021: $2.96m).\nA major contributing factor to these results, as stated in our trading update in February 2023, is the continuation of post-Covid and supply chain issues that have impacted our performance despite several successful trials of our technology by potential customers. We also experienced delays in the anticipated substantial orders from our LATAM distributor caused by local political disturbances but are hopeful that we will begin to see progress in the level of demand in the latter part of this year.\nLooking forward to the remainder of 2023, we are targeting a significant improvement in revenues and gross margins. This optimism is based on several business vectors and improvements, which we initially highlighted last year. First,\nwe have expanded in the USA with initial orders for Tetis units based on monthly payments for both devices and our software solutions. We see significant business potential in offering this innovative method to our product solutions and, assuming the required funding is available, we expect to deliver increased revenues by offering this payment solution in the USA and elsewhere.\nSecondly, we have completed major software and hardware improvements to meet clients\u00d5 needs and provide more holistic solutions, particularly in times of a global chip shortage. We have been working hard to make our products even better, faster, and more reliable. We are confident these improvements will make a real difference and help us stay ahead of the competition.\nWe have upgraded our entire product range to incorporate support for LTE Cat-1 (which has much better world-wide 4G coverage than previous devices with Cat-M1), as older generations of cellular networks are being phased out worldwide. We have moved our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which will improve the operational capability of our products. Furthermore, we have added new features to our products, for example, new types of reports, dashboards, and improvements to our control center, and enhanced the security feature across our product range. These improvements are expected to reduce manufacturing costs, thus improving our gross margins.\nThirdly, in 2022, we introduced four new products to the market: Tetis R Connect (Tetis R with BLE 4.2 support for scanning external standalone sensors for temperature, humidity, etc.), the Lokies 2.0 (featuring a new design, BLE 5.2 support, a new CPU, and improved energy efficiency), the new iteration of our Helios TT device, and two new versions of Helios M (for 2G and 4G networks).\nFinally, we have significantly expanded our presence at specialized exhibitions related to our technology while implementing multiple pilot schemes with new and existing customers. This has provided the opportunity to engage in pilot tests for our latest Lokies and Tetis products and receive valuable customer feedback.\nWe are already beginning to see the positive result of these im",

The Company expects to announce its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2022 in March 2023.\nThe Company expects to report total revenues for FY2022 of approximately US$4.0 million, including approximately $2.0 million\no\nf SaaS income representing approximately 50% of the total revenues for the period (2021:\n51\n%). This result was achieved in spite of the global supply chain issues faced by many companies and continuing business recovery from the Covid pandemic.\nIn 2022, the Company continued its expansion and is now well-positioned for this year with numerous opportunities and potential new key customers. It has continued its ongoing transition into the shipping container business sector with a number of pilot studies with potential new customers. As a result, initial orders from clients in the USA, South America, and Israel have been received, indicating a positive outlook for 2023.\nThis year started with presentations of\nthe Company's innovative solutions through DHL, Eseye, and other partners at key exhibitions in Brazil and Barcelona. The growing awareness of t42's Lokies and other products is already generating new leads and business opportunities.\nFurthermore, the Company expects to extend its presence in South America following the deals announced last year. Although small initial orders were received in 2022 due to local political reasons, t42's distributor expects that the situation will improve in the first half of this year\nand that more substantial orders will begin to be received\n.\nFollowing the growing demand in Africa,\nthe Company continues to support its Helios product line, meeting the need for product development. This includes integration support for 2G networks and above and tailor-designed solutions for various sectors, including t42's tracking and securing solutions for sensitive medical store deliveries supporting its long-term Tanzanian customers' requirements. Elsewhere,\nthe relationship with Zero motorcycles continues to be very positive, and further orders are expected this year.\nThe Company also announced the appointment of Openbox as a new distributor in the USA. Whilst so far they have not performed according to their expectations, nevertheless T42 has succeeded in directly winning new business in the USA, as announced in January 2023. Further orders are expected to be received during the course of 2023.\nIn recent months t42 has made several enhancements to its product offering through a new business model, which has been well-received by both existing and new potential customers. A significant development was the Company's decision to offer services while structuring payments for both devices and SaaS fees on a monthly payment basis as a leasing contract. t42 has already successfully contracted with a major USA company, adopting this payment structure, and who has indicated its intention to place further orders during 2023. The Company expects this structure to attract new clients and is evaluating funding requirements to support expansion of this new business model.\nThe Company is targeting significant revenue improvement in 2023 based on continued business with existing clients, including ongoing SaaS revenues. Meanwhile, the Company is focusing on the need to accelerate upfront cash payments to suppliers to shorten the supply chain period and ensure delivery preference. In parallel, the Board continues to explore acquisition opportunities to further broaden its business base and\nstrengthen its presence in its key markets.\nAvi Hartmann, CEO of t42, commented\n: \"We move forward with the new potential customers while implementing the lessons learned from the completed pilots and existing business. Our new strategy focusing on shipping container businesses has proven itself, with increasing demand for our products and services. With the new offering of lease-based contracts, the t42 Board is looking forward to the coming year with confidence.\"\nContacts:\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions PLC\nMichael Rosenberg, Chairman\nAvi Hartmann, CEO\n07785 727595\n+972 5477 35663\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Financial Adviser)\nJames Harris/ Richard Johnson/ Robert Collins\n020 7409 3494\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey/Eran Zucker\n020 7469 0930\nYellow Jersey PR\n(Financial PR)\nTom Randell/Henry Wilkinson/Annabelle Wills\n020 3004 9512\nt42@yellowjerseypr.com\nNotes to Editors\nt42 IoT Tracking Solutions plc\n(AIM: TRAC), formerly Starcom Systems plc, provides real-time tracking, analy",

Repayment of the balances in monthly instalments plus increased interest for Uri\u2019s loan suggests improved financial health/income no doubt assisted by recent Contguard deal. Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative). I am guessing we will get an upbeat AGM statement  before the meeting, possibly on the same morning.",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Personally I'm looking for some clarity and realism as it's been deafeningly quiet this year with no discernible indication of anymore contract wins other than Contguard. An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Personally I'm looking for some clarity and realism as it's been deafeningly quiet this year with no discernible indication of anymore contract wins other than Contguard. An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

Having said that it shouldn't be too difficult to raise the necessary funds on reasonable pricing terms if it's a guaranteed order which has stipulated delivery terms.",

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

High risk? Yes. High conviction upside? Absolutely. This is the kind of stock that doesn\u2019t reward hesitation \u2014 it rewards being early.",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Although I am biased, IMO the silver lining is the signaling to the Mkt that the Co will afford - in 2026 - to pay more as interest to its CTO and that it's slowly getting its debts in order (including the extra shares=dilution, in lieu of the Directors' fees).

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

Personally I'm looking for some clarity and realism as it's been deafeningly quiet this year with no discernible indication of anymore contract wins other than Contguard. An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Repayment of the balances in monthly instalments plus increased interest for Uri\u2019s loan suggests improved financial health/income no doubt assisted by recent Contguard deal. Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative).

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Repayment of the balances in monthly instalments plus increased interest for Uri\u2019s loan suggests improved financial health/income no doubt assisted by recent Contguard deal. Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative). I am guessing we will get an upbeat AGM statement  before the meeting, possibly on the same morning.",

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

Personally I'm looking for some clarity and realism as it's been deafeningly quiet this year with no discernible indication of anymore contract wins other than Contguard. An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Repayment of the balances in monthly instalments plus increased interest for Uri\u2019s loan suggests improved financial health/income no doubt assisted by recent Contguard deal. Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative). I am guessing we will get an upbeat AGM statement  before the meeting, possibly on the same morning.",

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

Personally I'm looking for some clarity and realism as it's been deafeningly quiet this year with no discernible indication of anymore contract wins other than Contguard. An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Repayment of the balances in monthly instalments plus increased interest for Uri\u2019s loan suggests improved financial health/income no doubt assisted by recent Contguard deal. Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative).

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

Personally I'm looking for some clarity and realism as it's been deafeningly quiet this year with no discernible indication of anymore contract wins other than Contguard. An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

These various businesses just seemed to suddenly disappear from getting any further mention in RNS, Annual Reports, etc back a few years ago around the time of the Company name change (Starlink to T42 lot Track) when focus was towards logistics related business. Were these other businesses including their related IP aspects etc retained by TRAC (active/dormant), sold-off, disbanded at nil value, etc ? Hope you can help clarify as I could foresee under the radar hidden value for some of these businesses still exists within TRAC.",

Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative).

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Although I am biased, IMO the silver lining is the signaling to the Mkt that the Co will afford - in 2026 - to pay more as interest to its CTO and that it's slowly getting its debts in order (including the extra shares=dilution, in lieu of the Directors' fees).

Both CLoans extended to eo2027; 2. One is being repaid in full by then, in payments of 25-75k per month (as per Notes in last Interims), showing repayment capacity, hence positive cash flow; 3. Contguard paying the Co in advance of orders, hence a CFlow of 2.5mln between Sept2025-Dec2026 - IMO, this is the game changer re Cash Flow requirements (i.e. surplus); All the Market needs now is the 2025 Trading Update, to show - IMO - a Net Profit and positive CFlow.

          "content": "I'm not aware that any specified chartist has issued a prediction about the performance of t42 in 2026 as I haven't seen any widely publicised forecast by a major financial analyst or firm. There's a lot of speculative discussions on share forums which suggests that the general sentiment is positive and that 2026 could shape up to be a strong year due to business improvements and new contracts and that it appears to be getting its finances in order. However, technical analysts really struggle to accurately predict share price movements in AIM companies due to the specific structural characteristics of AIM. Many companies have low trading volumes making it extremely difficult to buy or sell large positions without significantly affecting the the price. Low liquidity means that price movements are often erratic driven by a few large trades or individual investors rather than broad market psychology. There is often less media and analysis coverage which means information isn't widely disseminated or \"priced in\" efficiently which leads to sudden news driven price swings that no chart pattern could predict. Share prices of small companies are usually linked to single significant events such as a major contract win which happen without warning and can cause huge one-off price movements that defy historical patterns. Prices are also more susceptible to manipulation and the lack of sufficient reliable  historical data means its almost impossible impossible to form robust technical analysis which weighs heavily on past price action. Strong fundamentals are what drives the price of companies similar to t42 and these focus on the intrinsic value, financial health and management quality of the underlying company. Management have been making a lot of optimistic noises since the rebranding but nothing fundamental will change until they announce a major breakthrough with an award winning contract gain which will significantly improve the company's finances. t42 doesn't hold surplus cash so its scope is limited unless it can draw upon support from other financial benefactors but this will come at a price, possibly share dilution, or some of the financial rewards being diverted elsewhere. Their products seem to be held in high regard and they  proved their resilience during the recent AWS outage when many of their competitors struggled. I like the architectural design of their products and clearly a lot of thought and careful long term planning has gone into this which means they're less prone to suffering from unforeseen events which cripple many of their close competitors. For the moment they haven't managed to break through the ceiling despite all of the optimism generated several years ago with talks of multi-million dollars contracts in LatAm. The fact they've managed to survive for so long in such a cut throat environment  is some form of testament to their resilience but all of that optimism needs to be turned into something more tangible.",

An up-to-date assessment of the contracts announced in 2023 and 2024 would be most welcome. I'm hoping that H2/25 performance will reflect that when the Y/E accounting position is revealed. An update would also be welcome in relation to the development of our revolutionary innovative new product solution for the refrigerated air cargo supply chain. Hopefully this will represent a paradigm shift for the air cargo industry providing unprecedented control, efficiency and profitability, as previously promised. Two and a half years and still waiting on that score. There were also those series of mysterious tweets back in April/ May 2025 which supposedly signalled some imminent good news which doesn't yet appear to have materialised. An indication of the progress would be appreciated. Finally  resilience of t42's products was proven in the recent AWS outage which apparently made the Industry sit up and take note. Are there any signs that this will translate into larger and more profitable contracts for the company.",

Repayment of the balances in monthly instalments plus increased interest for Uri\u2019s loan suggests improved financial health/income no doubt assisted by recent Contguard deal. Option prices over next three years could be said to anticipate decent share price growth (leaving aside any transformational Newco or other partnership deal as per recent RNS which could, in my view, make those prices look conservative). I am guessing we will get an upbeat AGM statement  before the meeting, possibly on the same morning.",

          "content": "I couldn't make this years AGM but am told it was relatively upbeat despite very little being revealed. Apparently we're expecting improved Revenues and GP margins and may even turn EBITDA+ which would be extremely welcoming. Uri was pressed about our resilience following the AWS outage and whether our competitors could replicate what we did in order to remain operational. Uri maintains it would take 2/3 years for a competitor to replicate because that capability is engineered into our platform and isn't something that could be done overnight. This forms part of the technological advantage our products have which in Management's view would take a third party 2/3 years to catch-up but in the meantime we may have moved further ahead. Some parties thought it was suggested we may get an update in early February. I wouldn't bet on that but would be extremely pleased if this comes to fruition. So following the 2025 Interims, the headlines are revenue is growing, gross margins are improving, and adjusted EBITDA may have flipped positive. There is also a sizeable post-period contract that pays upfront \u2013 exactly what you want to see in a hardware-plus-SaaS business. Management says it is on track for at least 200% year-over-year growth in Lokies revenues. Hardware sales today plant the seeds for higher-margin software tomorrow, because each deployed device drives ongoing SaaS subscriptions and that change in mix is already visible with hopefully SaaS doing the heavy lifting on margins. Additional improvement in gross profit margins would be the tailwind towards profitability. The upfront payment on the Contguard contract is most welcome with some Revenue landing in 2025 and the majority in 2026 but that's excellent for cashflow and reduces execution risk. There are tighter protections for lenders and hitting those monthly payments is important. On the + side one of the loans is already being repaid in instalments. According to their cash flow forecasts Management believes that with the benefit of production efficiencies, customer purchase agreements and the loan extensions that  it can meet its obligations. However,  the two CLNs are convertible into up to 117.1 million shares as at 30 June 2025. That is a significant source of potential dilution if converted. In Ecuador,  integration has been completed and initial vehicles are connected. Management expects deployments to have increased in H2/25 whilst in Mexico,\u2013 roughly half of the contract has been executed, with the remainder currently on hold. No timeline disclosed. There are more products to broaden the addressable market and improve the SaaS opportunity whilst diversifying away from any single device line. Overall, the business is beginning to show signs of slowly moving in the right direction on sales, margins and profitability measures, albeit from a constrained balance sheet. If t42 converts its sales pipeline and keeps costs tight, the operational progress could start to outpace",

Although I am biased, IMO the silver lining is the signaling to the Mkt that the Co will afford - in 2026 - to pay more as interest to its CTO and that it's slowly getting its debts in order (including the extra shares=dilution, in lieu of the Directors' fees).
