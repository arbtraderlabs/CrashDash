This record-breaking year was supported by the continued robust operational performance at Runruno, as well as the favourable gold price environment.\n\"In Nicaragua, we have seen excellent momentum in the development of the La India Gold Project towards production, which remains on track for first gold in Q4 2026. Overall construction is ahead of schedule at 33%, and I look forward to providing further updates on progress throughout 2026. With an annual production target of 145,000 oz of gold, La India will serve to replace cash flow from Runruno as mining operations cease there.\n\"\nAt Runruno, we achieved FY2025 gold production of 65,287 oz, within the revised FY2025 lower guidance forecast of 65,000 oz. This revision came as a result of production delays due to the Q3 2025 BIOX cyanide contamination issue, which was subsequently resolved, and the impact of Super-typhoon Uwan in Q4 2025, where mains power was restored earlier than forecasted. Our production guidance for FY2026 at Runruno is 50,000 - 60,000 oz due to the mine approaching the end of its life with the mine plan scheduling lower grade material with slightly lower recovery performance, with AISC forecasted at US$1,400 - US$1,650 /oz, and we look forward to continuing to capitalise on the supportive gold price environment.\n\"Drilling at Dupax to date has indicated that the target ore zone is deeper than predicted. As a result, we have concluded that an economic resource at Dupax will not be able to be defined in time for Runruno's ore processing operations to be extended via the processing of Dupax ore. Accordingly, we are considering other options to repurpose the Runruno plant and will keep shareholders updated with any developments.\n\"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and I am pleased to report that the Company now has in excess of 2 million man-hours worked in the Philippines without an LTI. In Nicaragua, we have not recorded an LTI since Metals Exploration acquired La India.\n\"We finished FY2025 in a very strong position, with record revenue and free cash flow. The Company is debt free, and is targeting FY2026 gold production of 50,000 - 60,000 oz from Runruno.

Production was paused for approximately seven days while repairs to the power grid were conducted in various parts of the Nueva Viscaya province. Back-up generators ensured no loss of BIOX bacteria. Mining operations were also suspended for two days. Mains power was restored to the site, with processing operations able to recommence, earlier than forecasted.\nAnnual gold production was 65,287 oz, at the lower end of the revised guidance of 65,000-70,000 oz, having been impacted by both production delays due to Super-typhoon Uwan and the Q3 2025 BIOX cyanide contamination issue.\nFinance\nFY2025 operations at Runruno produced record gold sales of US$208.4 million (FY2024: US$191.1 million) resulting in a record US$115.3 million pre-tax free cash flow (FY2024: US$96.7 million).\nQ4 2025 recorded gold sales of US$63.9 million (Q3 2025: US$25.5 million), at an average realised gold price of US$3,995 /oz (Q3 2025: average gold price of US$2,889 /oz); producing positive free cash flow of US$40.0 million (Q3 2025: US$4.5 million).\nThe Company's cash holdings at 31 December 2025 were US$41.6 million (30 September 2025: US$28.3 million). The Group has no debt.\nMining Operations\nMining production of ore and waste for Q4 2025 was slightly below management's forecast at 2.79 Mt (Q3 2025: 1.99 Mt). During Q4 2025, a total of 710 Kt of ore was mined (Q3 2025: 404 Kt). The Company continues to forecast that mining operations will cease in Q3-2026 due to depletion of ore but processing will continue as detailed below.\nProcess Plant\nGold produced during Q4 2025 was 15,156 oz (Q3 2025: 9,145 oz) from ore milled in Q4 2025 of 538 Kt (Q3 2025: 324 Kt), at an AISC of US$1,584 /oz (Q3 2025: US$1,923 /oz). Head grade was lower than forecast at 1.04 g/t (Q3 2025: 1.06 g/t).\nAverage gold recovery rate for Q4 2025 was 84.1% (Q3 2025: 83.3%). Average recoveries for FY2026 are expected to be approximately 82% due to a lower average head grade and continued processing of lower recovery material. Gold processing activities are expected to cease in late-2026 or early 2027.\nResidual Storage Impoundment (\"RSI\")\nDuring the Quarter, the Runruno mine received higher than normal rainfall as numerous typhoons passed over/close to the mine site. Notwithstanding the high rainfall, the RSI dam\nwater freeboard remains well above design minimum levels. Construction of the RSI final in-rock spillway continues.\nDevelopment\nLa India Gold Project\nProgress of construction works at the La India mine site in Nicaragua has progressed very satisfactorily during the Quarter with overall construction remaining within the revised budget and slightly ahead of schedule, being 33% complete, being\nfully funded to date from the Runruno gold mine cash flow. The Company's ambition to produce gold during Q4 2026 remains intact. Highlights for the Quarter include:\n\u00b7\nNo lost time injuries (\"LTI\").\n\u00b7\nThe processing plant throughput capacity design has been upgraded to 1.8 million tonnes per annum (\"mTpa\") from 1.4 mTpa, in anticipation of future growth opportunities\n.\n\u00b7\nThe on-site laboratory building is nearing completion and is scheduled to be operational from February 2026.\n\u00b7\nBulk earthworks for the processing plant and technical services area are complete. Pre-stripping of the open pit mining area is on schedule, at approximately 19% complete.\n\u00b7\nThe run-of-mine (\"ROM\") pad is complete, and the first ore has commenced stockpiling.\n\u00b7\nThe tailings storage facility access is complete.\n\u00b7\nConstruction of key infrastructure is progressing ahead of schedule; with several camp accommodation buildings completed and operational.\n\u00b7\nExploration, geo-technical and infill resource extension drilling for the Quarter totalled 4,676 metres.\nExploration - Philippines\nDupax Project\nLimited drilling was undertaken during Q4 2025 due to the impact of Super-typhoon Uwan combined with the Company managing local community access issues. Drilling to date has indicated that the target ore zone is significantly deeper than predicted, leading to the Company to conclude that an economic resource at Dupax will not be able to be defined within a time period such that the Runruno process plant can be converted to process Dupax ore. As a result, other options to re-purpose the Runruno plant are being considered.\nDrilling results from this programme will be announced in due course.\nAbra Project\nDrill programmes on the Abra tenement remain on hold while\nthe National Commission for Indigenous Peoples ('NCIP') further advances its consultation activities with the potentially impacted local communities.\nThe Company's expectation remains that drilling in the Abra project area will commence later in FY2026.\nESG\nOccupational Health & Safety\nThe Company completed the Quarter without an LTI. The Company now has in excess of 2 million man-hours worked in the Philippines without an LTI. The Company has recorded no LTI's at its operations in Nicaragua since commencing operations in country.\nEnvironment & Compliance\nCompliance matters continue to be successfully monitored, and all operations in both the Philippines and Nicaragua are compliant with no outstanding material issues.\nCommunity & Government Relations\nThe Company continues to receive strong support from local communities and government agencies in both the Philippines and Nicaragua.\nThis announcement\ncontains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended). Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nEND\nFor further information, please contact or visit:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nJoint Broker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nJoint Broker:\nPANMURE LIBERUM\nAmrit Mahbubani, Scott Mathieson, Zak Wadud\n+44 (0) 203 100 2112\nPublic Relations:\nBLYTHERAY\nMegan Ray, Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204metalsexploration@blytheray.com\nWeb:\nwww.metalsexploration.com\nX:\n@MTLexploration\nLinkedIn:\nMetals Exploration\nCompetent Person's Statement\nMr Maxwell Donald Tuesley, BSc (Hons) Economic Geology, a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (No 111470 and employee of the Company, has compiled, read and approved the technical disclosure in relation to the projects in this regulatory announcement in accordance with the AIM Rules - Note for Mining and Oil & Gas Companies.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements relating to the estimated or expected future production, operating results, cash flows and costs and financial condition of Metals Explorations, planned work at the Company's projects and the expected results of such work contained herein are forward-looking statements\nwhich are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the potential returns of the Group, industry and markets in which the Group operates in, the Directors' beliefs and assumptions made by the Directors\n.
