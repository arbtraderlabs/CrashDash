This record-breaking year was supported by the continued robust operational performance at Runruno, as well as the favourable gold price environment.\n\"In Nicaragua, we have seen excellent momentum in the development of the La India Gold Project towards production, which remains on track for first gold in Q4 2026. Overall construction is ahead of schedule at 33%, and I look forward to providing further updates on progress throughout 2026. With an annual production target of 145,000 oz of gold, La India will serve to replace cash flow from Runruno as mining operations cease there.\n\"\nAt Runruno, we achieved FY2025 gold production of 65,287 oz, within the revised FY2025 lower guidance forecast of 65,000 oz. This revision came as a result of production delays due to the Q3 2025 BIOX cyanide contamination issue, which was subsequently resolved, and the impact of Super-typhoon Uwan in Q4 2025, where mains power was restored earlier than forecasted. Our production guidance for FY2026 at Runruno is 50,000 - 60,000 oz due to the mine approaching the end of its life with the mine plan scheduling lower grade material with slightly lower recovery performance, with AISC forecasted at US$1,400 - US$1,650 /oz, and we look forward to continuing to capitalise on the supportive gold price environment.\n\"Drilling at Dupax to date has indicated that the target ore zone is deeper than predicted. As a result, we have concluded that an economic resource at Dupax will not be able to be defined in time for Runruno's ore processing operations to be extended via the processing of Dupax ore. Accordingly, we are considering other options to repurpose the Runruno plant and will keep shareholders updated with any developments.\n\"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and I am pleased to report that the Company now has in excess of 2 million man-hours worked in the Philippines without an LTI. In Nicaragua, we have not recorded an LTI since Metals Exploration acquired La India.\n\"We finished FY2025 in a very strong position, with record revenue and free cash flow. The Company is debt free, and is targeting FY2026 gold production of 50,000 - 60,000 oz from Runruno. With La India due to start production in Q4 2026, I am optimistic about the Company's year ahead and look forward to updating shareholders with our progress.\"\nRunruno Production and Finance Summary\nRunruno Project Report\nQuarter\nQuarter\nFY 2025\nFY 2024\nFY 2025\nActual\nActual\nActual\nActual\nPHYSICALS\nUnits\nQ4 2025\nQ4\u00a02024\n12 Months\n12 Months\nMining\nOre Mined\nTonnes\n709,920\n283,862\n2,142,187\n2,055,871\nWaste Mined\nTonnes\n2,077,887\n2,418,510\n8,557,364\n9,293,694\nTotal Mined\nTonnes\n2,787,807\n2,702,372\n10,699,551\n11,349,565\nAu Grade Mined\ng/tonne\n1.02\n1.50\n1.28\n1.46\nStrip Ratio\n2.91\n8.50\n3.92\n4.40\nProcessing\nOre Milled\nTonnes\n537,824\n529,791\n1,902,702\n2,150,429\nAu Grade\ng/tonne\n1.04\n1.17\n1.21\n1.34\nS2 Grade\n%\n1.17\n1.30\n1.19\n1.35\nAu Milled (contained)\nOunces\n18,019\n19,934\n73,844\n92,752\nRecovery\n%\n84.1\n94.5\n88.4\n90.5\nAu Recovered/Poured\nOunces\n15,156\n18,829\n65,287\n83,897\nSales\nAu Sold\nOunces\n16,009\n19,144\n66,082\n82,676\nAu Price\nUS$/oz\n3,995\n2,481\n3,154\n2,312\nFINANCIALS (Unaudited)\nRevenue\nGold Sales\n(US$000's)\n63,949\n47,490\n208,413\n191,150\nOperating Costs - Summary\nMining\n(US$000's)\n4,794\n4,868\n19,506\n18,879\nProcessing\n(US$000's)\n7,882\n8,139\n32,692\n34,919\nG&A\n(US$000's)\n2,783\n2,569\n13,086\n11,649\nTotal Operating Costs\n(US$000's)\n15,459\n15,576\n65,284\n65,447\nExcise Duty\n(US$000's)\n2,572\n1,913\n8,365\n7,668\nUK/Philippine G&A\n(US$000's)\n3,254\n5,244\n11,104\n13,768\nTotal Direct Production Costs\n(US$000's)\n21,285\n22,733\n84,753\n86,882\nNet Cash Income\n(US$000's)\n42,664\n24,757\n123,661\n104,267\nTotal Capital Costs\n(US$000's)\n2,656\n2,263\n8,391\n7,518\nTotal non-cash costs\n(US$000's)\n15,769\n13,110\n111,062\n69,794\nPre-tax Free Cashflow\n(\nUS$000's)\n40,008\n22,494\n115,270\n96,749\nCash Cost / oz Sold - C1\nUS$/oz\n1,126\n797\n979\n785\nCash Cost / oz Sold - AISC1\nUS$/oz\n1,584\n1,289\n1,368\n1,135\nNote 1: AISC includes all UK Corporate costs. It excludes costs directly related to the Nicaraguan assets.\nRunruno Operations\nIn November 2025, processing operations were impacted by the loss of mains power to site due to damage to the National power grid caused by Super-typhoon Uwan. Production was paused for approximately seven days while repairs to the power grid were conducted in various parts of the Nueva Viscaya province. Back-up generators ensured no loss of BIOX bacteria. Mining operations were also suspended for two days. Mains power was restored to the site, with processing operations able to recommence, earlier than forecasted.\nAnnual gold production was 65,287 oz, at the lower end of the revised guidance of 65,000-70,000 oz, having been impacted by both production delays due to Super-typhoon Uwan and the Q3 2025 BIOX cyanide contamination issue.\nFinance\nFY2025 operations at Runruno produced record gold sales of US$208.4 million (FY2024: US$191.1 million) resulting in a record US$115.3 million pre-tax free cash flow (FY2024: US$96.7 million).\nQ4 2025 recorded gold sales of US$63.9 million (Q3 2025: US$25.5 million), at an average realised gold price of US$3,995 /oz (Q3 2025: average gold price of US$2,889 /oz); producing positive free cash flow of US$40.0 million (Q3 2025: US$4.5 million).\nThe Company's cash holdings at 31 December 2025 were US$41.6 million (30 September 2025: US$28.3 million). The Group has no debt.\nMining Operations\nMining production of ore and waste for Q4 2025 was slightly below management's forecast at 2.79 Mt (Q3 2025: 1.99 Mt). During Q4 2025, a total of 710 Kt of ore was mined (Q3 2025: 404 Kt). The Company continues to forecast that mining operations will cease in Q3-2026 due to depletion of ore but processing will continue as detailed below.\nProcess Plant\nGold produced during Q4 2025 was 15,156 oz (Q3 2025: 9,145 oz) from ore milled in Q4 2025 of 538 Kt (Q3 2025: 324 Kt), at an AISC of US$1,584 /oz (Q3 2025: US$1,923 /oz). Head grade was lower than forecast at 1.04 g/t (Q3 2025: 1.06 g/t).\nAverage gold recovery rate for Q4 2025 was 84.1% (Q3 2025: 83.3%). Average recoveries for FY2026 are expected to be approximately 82% due to a lower average head grade and continued processing of lower recovery material. Gold processing activities are expected to cease in late-2026 or early 2027.\nResidual Storage Impoundment (\"RSI\")\nDuring the Quarter, the Runruno mine received higher than normal rainfall as numerous typhoons passed over/close to the mine site. Notwithstanding the high rainfall, the RSI dam\nwater freeboard remains well above design minimum levels. Construction of the RSI final in-rock spillway continues.\nDevelopment\nLa India Gold Project\nProgress of construction works at the La India mine site in Nicaragua has progressed very satisfactorily during the Quarter with overall construction remaining within the revised budget and slightly ahead of schedule, being 33% complete, being\nfully funded to date from the Runruno gold mine cash flow. The Company's ambition to produce gold during Q4 2026 remains intact. Highlights for the Quarter include:\n\u00b7\nNo lost time injuries (\"LTI\").\n\u00b7\nThe processing plant throughput capacity design has been upgraded to 1.8 million tonnes per annum (\"mTpa\") from 1.4 mTpa, in anticipation of future growth opportunities\n.\n\u00b7\nThe on-site laboratory building is nearing completion and is scheduled to be operational from February 2026.\n\u00b7\nBulk earthworks for the processing plant and technical services area are complete. Pre-stripping of the open pit mining area is on schedule, at approximately 19% complete.\n\u00b7\nThe run-of-mine (\"ROM\") pad is complete, and the first ore has commenced stockpiling.\n\u00b7\nThe tailings storage facility access is complete.\n\u00b7\nConstruction of key infrastructure is progressing ahead of schedule; with several camp accommodation buildings completed and operational.\n\u00b7\nExploration, geo-technical and infill resource extension drilling for the Quarter totalled 4,676 metres.\nExploration - Philippines\nDupax Project\nLimited drilling was undertaken during Q4 2025 due to the impact of Super-typhoon Uwan combined with the Company managing local community access issues. Drilling to date has indicated that the target ore zone is significantly deeper than predicted, leading to the Company to conclude that an economic resource at Dupax will not be able to be defined within a time period such that the Runruno process plant can be converted to process Dupax ore. As a result, other options to re-purpose the Runruno plant are being considered.\nDrilling results from this programme will be announced in due course.\nAbra Project\nDrill programmes on the Abra tenement remain on hold while\nthe National Commission for Indigenous Peoples ('NCIP') further advances its consultation activities with the potentially impacted local communities.\nThe Company's expectation remains that drilling in the Abra project area will commence later in FY2026.\nESG\nOccupational Health & Safety\nThe Company completed the Quarter without an LTI. The Company now has in excess of 2 million man-hours worked in the Philippines without an LTI. The Company has recorded no LTI's at its operations in Nicaragua since commencing operations in country.\nEnvironment & Compliance\nCompliance matters continue to be successfully monitored, and all operations in both the Philippines and Nicaragua are compliant with no outstanding material issues.\nCommunity & Government Relations\nThe Company continues to receive strong support from local communities and government agencies in both the Philippines and Nicaragua.\nThis announcement\ncontains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

This record-breaking year was supported by the continued robust operational performance at Runruno, as well as the favourable gold price environment.\n\"In Nicaragua, we have seen excellent momentum in the development of the La India Gold Project towards production, which remains on track for first gold in Q4 2026. Overall construction is ahead of schedule at 33%, and I look forward to providing further updates on progress throughout 2026. With an annual production target of 145,000 oz of gold, La India will serve to replace cash flow from Runruno as mining operations cease there.\n\"\nAt Runruno, we achieved FY2025 gold production of 65,287 oz, within the revised FY2025 lower guidance forecast of 65,000 oz. This revision came as a result of production delays due to the Q3 2025 BIOX cyanide contamination issue, which was subsequently resolved, and the impact of Super-typhoon Uwan in Q4 2025, where mains power was restored earlier than forecasted. Our production guidance for FY2026 at Runruno is 50,000 - 60,000 oz due to the mine approaching the end of its life with the mine plan scheduling lower grade material with slightly lower recovery performance, with AISC forecasted at US$1,400 - US$1,650 /oz, and we look forward to continuing to capitalise on the supportive gold price environment.\n\"Drilling at Dupax to date has indicated that the target ore zone is deeper than predicted. As a result, we have concluded that an economic resource at Dupax will not be able to be defined in time for Runruno's ore processing operations to be extended via the processing of Dupax ore. Accordingly, we are considering other options to repurpose the Runruno plant and will keep shareholders updated with any developments.\n\"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and I am pleased to report that the Company now has in excess of 2 million man-hours worked in the Philippines without an LTI. In Nicaragua, we have not recorded an LTI since Metals Exploration acquired La India.\n\"We finished FY2025 in a very strong position, with record revenue and free cash flow. The Company is debt free, and is targeting FY2026 gold production of 50,000 - 60,000 oz from Runruno. With La India due to start production in Q4 2026, I am optimistic about the Company's year ahead and look forward to updating shareholders with our progress.\"\nRunruno Pro",

La India continues to benefit from a strengthened Nicaraguan management team, strong contractor performance, improved community relations, and rapid mobilisation of the processing plant and equipment.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nDevelopment schedule\n- The development remains ahead of schedule at 24% complete at the end of November compared to the 20% forecast, and is expected to be fully funded from FY2026 Runruno gold mine cash flow.\n\u00b7\nProcessing Plant Capacity Upgrade\n- The processing plant (the \"Plant\") throughput capacity design has been upgraded to 1.8 million tonnes per annum (\"mTpa\") from 1.4 mTpa, in anticipation of future growth opportunities.\n\u00b7\nLaboratory setup\n-\nThe on-site laboratory building is nearing completion and scheduled to be operative from February 2026.\n\u00b7\nEarthworks and Site Preparation\n- Bulk earthworks for the processing plant and technical services area are complete. Pre-stripping of the open pit mining area is on schedule, at approximately 17% complete.\n\u00b7\nROM pad\n- The run-of-mine (\"ROM\") pad is complete and the first ore has commenced stockpiling.\n\u00b7\nSite Infrastructure\n- Construction of key non-process infrastructure is progressing ahead of schedule; with several camp accommodation buildings completed and operational.\n\u00b7\nCommunity Relations\n- Agreement was reached with artisanal miners to acquire land rights from the local artisanal Cooperativa. All artisanal miners have left the La India open pit area.\n\u00b7\nSafety & Health\n- No lost time injuries since construction commenced.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented\n:\n\"\nWe are extremely pleased with the continued momentum at La India, where development and construction activities are progressing on or ahead of schedule. Major earthworks have been completed, key infrastructure is taking shape, and concrete foundations are well advanced in the crushing, grinding and CIL tank areas. We have already begun stockpiling early ore feed on the ROM pad. Our exploration programme is also progressing well, with drilling expanding into priority areas such as Cacao, and surface works at Phase 1 North identifying immediate opportunities to grow the resource base in the open pit.\n\"These achievements give us increasing confidence in delivering first gold during Q4 2026. La India is advancing safely and quickly, underpinned by a strengthened local management team, improved community partnerships, and the dedication of our workforce and contractors. We remain excited by the long-term potential of the Project and look forward to providing further updates as work progresses.\"\nDevelopment and Construction Progress\nConstruction and development activities are proceeding smoothly across all disciplines. Total development remains ahead of schedule at 24% complete at the end of November compared to 20% forecast. Total CAPEX expenditure for FY2025 is forecast to be approximately US$70 million, with the balance of the CAPEX spend fully funded from the expected FY2026 forecast Runruno gold mine cash flow. The below table shows actual performance against the construction schedule, and key construction milestones are also shown.\n\u200b\nTable 1: La India Development Schedule and Milestones\nProcessing Plant\nThe Rock Creek plant, including crushers, conveyors, ball mill, Sepro Falcon gravity circuit, smelting equipment, and laboratory, acquired in March 2025, arrived on site in August 2025. Key containers have been unpacked and the major components are being prepared for installation. For operational efficiencies, new motors and gear drives have been acquired for the grinding circuit so each mill (one SAG and one Ball) will run on the same equipment.\nGiven the numerous opportunities to expand operations in and around La India, the Plant throughput capacity design has been increased from 1.4 mTpa to 1.8 mTpa. This increased capacity necessitated the acquisition of a new elution circuit and gold room, rather than using the items that were acquired as part of the Rock Creek Plant package. This increase in design capacity has moved the total CAPEX forecast marginally from US$160 million to US$165 million. The development remains within this revised CAPEX budget and is expected to remain fully funded from FY2026 free cash flow from the Runruno Philippine gold mine.\nPlant construction is ahead of schedule wit",

The discovery of additional near-surface mineralisation provides an immediate opportunity to enhance recoverable ounces and potentially improve Phase 1 economics. Our forthcoming drilling programme is designed to rapidly test these new zones and unlock further value from what is shaping up to be a highly prospective epithermal system.\"\nChannel Sample Results\nThe construction of new access roads to the Phase 1 North pit area exposed fresh mineralised outcrops enabling systematic channel sampling at the northernmost extent of the presently outlined La India system. This enabled\nsampling across two structural zones.\nThe first zone tested was at the intersection of the La India and Teresa systems. The sampled sequence along a NW-SE trend, consistent with the La India structure includes a 2.0 metre massive quartz vein underlain by 5.08 metre hydrothermal breccia, defining a 7.08 metre wide mineralised interval @ 3.08 grammes of gold per tonne (\"g/t Au\").\nThe highest grades coincide with the intersection of the La India and Teresa mineralised systems, confirming this structural node as a priority target. Sampling of an NNW-oriented hydrothermal breccia (CHN-016) suggests an additional structural control on mineralisation.\nThe second zone tested the continuity of the La India N-S trend. Here CHN-019 exposed a hydrothermal breccia in contact with a massive quartz vein, correlated with CHN-018 upslope and previous trench results to the north.\nThe combined data defines a 5.14 metre interval @ 0.94 g/t Au, supporting the continuity of the N-S La India mineralised trend further north. The structural contact between tectonic and hydrothermal breccias marks the lateral boundary of mineralisation at this point.\nPit Design Implications\nThe surface sampling campaign has confirmed new near-surface mineralisation along the NW extension of the La India structure, representing an immediate opportunity to expand the Phase 1 North pit by approximately 100 metres.\nIf drilling confirms continuity of the La India system at depth and along NW strike, additional expansions of the final mining area are possible.\nFuture Works\nA high priority drill programme will be conducted to test the continuity of the newly exposed veins. The objective will be to test the continuity of the La India structure to validate the extent of the pit extension, and to test down-dip projection of high-grade intervals identified in this zone. Additional drilling following the CHN-018/019 correlations will test the extent of the N-S La India trend. These results will be combined with the historical trench results from the nearby La Mora and El Escondido alignments.\nIn addition, the Company will undertake detailed structural mapping around the La India-Teresa intersection zone to refine targets, and to map the NNW-trending breccia system (CHN-016) to determine its role as a secondary conduit.\nThe Company will update the Phase 1 North pit shell incorporating the NW extension scenario, while running sensitivity scenarios assuming successful additional drilling results.\nFigure 1: Channel sampling and structural interpretation map for the La India project, showing areas of newly identified mineralisation.\nEND\nFor further information, please contact or visit:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nJoint Broker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nJoint Broker\nAmrit Mahbubani, Scott Mathieson, Zak Wadud\nPANMURE LIBERUM\n+44\u202f(0) 20 3100 2000\nPublic Relations:",

Uwan was the strongest to pass over the Runruno project site, bringing heavy rainfall and severe winds. The resulting damage to the project site included the loss of river crossings, damage to access roads, loss of roofing and subsequent water damage in administration and maintenance buildings, and minor land/mud-slips in the pit area and elsewhere around the project site. In addition, drill pads at the Dupax project suffered damage, temporarily setting back the drill programme there while repairs take place. Drilling at Dupax is expected to resume within the next two weeks.\nFortunately, the damage to the mine, process plant and other site infrastructure is not material, and clean-up works are well advanced. Main grid power to the site was lost as numerous electrical poles were downed both, in close proximity to the mine, and within the broader Nueva Viscaya province. Back-up generators ensured no loss of BIOX bacteria.\nIt is expected that mains power to the site will be re-established within the next few days, resulting in a pause to processing operations of approximately seven days. A further update will be provided once processing operations resume. Mining operations recommenced on 11 November 2025.\nDespite the large run-off of rainwater into the Residual Storage Impoundment (\"RSI\"), the RSI maintained integrity and over four metres of freeboard remained at the peak of the rain inflow into the RSI dam.\nThere has been some damage to local community infrastructure, including a nearby bridge that is used to access the Runruno project area. Alternative access routes have been developed to ensure that there is no interruption to the delivery of fuel, consumable supplies, etc, to the project site. Where possible, the Company has provided equipment and personnel to assist the local community with clean-up efforts.\nAnnual Production Guidance\nThis power and processing interruption, combined with further changes to the mine schedule necessitated by the clean-up of the pit areas, and the cyanide contamination in September 2025, has resulted in the Company revising its annual gold production guidance from 70,000-75,000 ounces to 65-000-70,000 ounces.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented\n:\n\"\nOur thoughts are with all of those across the country who have lost loved ones and been affected not only by Uwan but the other serious typhoons that have impacted the Philippines this typhoon season.\nW\ne are relieved that there were no injuries at Runruno, and that there was no material damage to the mine, process plant or other site infrastructure.\"\n\"While it is disappointing to revise our annual production guidance downwards, our focus for the rest of the year will be on maximising value generation from our mining and processing operations at Runruno, while continuing to provide meaningful support to the local community during this challenging period; as well as progressing the construction at La India in Nicaragua.\"\nThis announcement\ncontains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

Processing operations have now resumed as normal, and no change to the Company's FY2025 production guidance is required.\n\"We are pleased to report that the development of La India is progressing well. Construction is currently slightly ahead of schedule, and on budget. The Rock Creek process plant arrived ahead of schedule in August 2025 and has now been delivered to site for commencement of the plant erection. Bulk earthworks at the process plant terrace were completed during the Quarter, with the ROM pad and magazine platform bulk earthworks nearing completion. Access earthworks to the tailings storage facility access is approximately 25% complete, and construction of various buildings including offices, the mine camp and the fuel storage facility are all progressing ahead of schedule. Our goal to reach first production of gold at La India during Q4 2026 remains firmly on track.\n\"Following issuance of the Dupax exploration licence in August 2025, we conducted an IP ground geophysics survey. The results of this survey were interpreted and resulted in the amendment of targets for the follow-up 2,500 metre drill programme which is underway. Results from this drill programme will be announced as they become available.\n\"Now that processing operations at Runruno are back to normal, we look forward to a more positive Q4 where we can continue to capitalise on the operational excellence of our team amongst the backdrop of the favourable high gold price environment. I look forward to providing further updates about La India's development as well as results of drilling at Dupax.

As always, I am grateful to our in-country team for their diligence and dedication to ensuring the project's success. Our excellent financial performance was also supported by the current favourable gold price environment.\"\n\"Since acquiring Condor, we have carried out an aggressive development programme at La India. This includes awarding the majority of the contracts required to complete construction of the project, and agreements to relocate artisanal miners. We purchased the Rock Creek gold ore processing and concentrating plant, which I am pleased to report has now arrived in Nicaragua and will be transported to the project area during September. Purchasing the plant allows us to fast track project development, saving considerable devel\no\npment time.\"\n\"La India was previously outlined as having a 2.2 million oz gold resource by Condor. The Board believes there is significant upside potential through a combination of an expansion of existing Mineral Resources and potential new discoveries. The Company has committed to a minimum 40,000 metre drill programme within the next five years to further explore the potential of the La India district and unlock further value here.\"\n\"Following receipt of the Dupax exploration licence, 20km from Runruno, we have now commenced an IP survey in parallel with a 2,500 metre drill programme. We are excited about the potential that Dupax offers, and look forward to updating shareholders with the results of the exploration campaign. The discovery of an economic resource at Dupax could result in the extension of ore processing operations at Runruno. In addition, drill programmes for three key initial target areas of the Abra project have been d\ne\nsigned, and are expected to commence in Q1 2026.\"\n\"In both the Philippines and Nicaragua, our aim is to create a net-positive impact for stakeholders and local communities, with strong community engagement at the forefront of our operations. We are pleased to have continued with the initiatives in Nicaragua previously implemented by Condor. Our goal is to build on this and further strengthen these relationships as we move towards production at La India.\"\n\"I look forward to providing further updates on the status of development at La India, mining operations at Runruno, and the exploration campaign at Dupax.\"\nCorporate\nCondor Gold plc Acquisition\nOn 15 January 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of Condor Gold plc (\"Condor\") via a court sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement.\nCondor is the 100% owner of an extensive highly prospective tenement package in Nicaragua, including the La India gold resource\n.\nBeing the Company's first",

          "full_content": "28 Aug 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 9379W\nMetals Exploration PLC\n28 August 2025\n28 August 2025\nMETALS EXPLORATION PLC\nRunruno Operational Update\nMetals Exploration plc (AIM: MTL) (\"Metals Exploration\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\"), a gold production, exploration, and development company with assets in the Philippines and Nicaragua, wishes to advise the market of an approximate six week deferral of gold production that has taken place at Runruno.\nThe deferral of gold production is to allow new process monitoring and production procedures to be implemented following a cyanide contamination impacting the BIOX circuit. However, the Company can confirm that, despite the temporary pause in production, as at the date of this announcement, no amendment to the Company's FY2025 production forecast range is required.\nThe Company paused processing of ore while it determined the cause of a contamination impacting the BIOX circuit, which was initially determined to have originated from cyanide contaminated water upstream from Runruno due to illegal mining activity. The contamination required the BIOX circuit to be drained, cleaned and new bacteria inoculated, however, the new bacteria have been unable to recover fully due to ongoing contamination issues.\nThe Company has recently discovered that a second source of contamination can be attributed to ore feed from Stage 5-6 small scale mining tunnels, where recent illegal mining activity has resulted in residual cyanide contamination of ore delivered to the run-of-mine (\"ROM\") pad. Unfortunately, the BIOX bacteria has been unable to cope with the levels of cyanide in the BIOX feed. Accordingly, new and additional monitoring protocols will be introduced to minimise the impact of this contamination, both now and in the future, which are expected to resolve the issue.\nThe Company believes the use of cyanide to process ore within the illegal miners' tunnels is a recent development following the removal of all illegal ball mills from the area last year. Accordingly, the Company believes the cyanide contamination will be limited given very few tunnels have been reopened by the illegal miners due to the Company's ongoing policing and security efforts.\nAn extensive network of illegal miners' tunnels are being discovered as mining moves through Stages 5-6 at Runruno, and although the extent of illegal mining is much larger than previously thought, the Company believes the residual cyanide issue is isolated and can be carefully managed for the remainder of mining in Stages 5-6. Testing of ROM pad ore is currently underway to ringfence the remaining contaminated ore to prevent a repeat of damage to the BIOX circuit bacteria.\nThe source of water contamination from illegal mining upstream from Runruno, which introduced cyanide into the water feed into the BIOX circuit, has also been resolved and water feed will be regularly tested to ensure it is not repeated.\nDuring the contamination period, only minimal ore has been fed into the plant. As a result, the current issue will not result in any material loss of overall gold production, rather it has resulted in a delay in gold production. The deferred ounces not produced over this period will be produced at a later point in the remaining life of the Runruno mine.\nThe Company estimates that production levels will return to planned levels within the next two weeks.\nDespite this set back, as at the date of this announcement, no amendment to the Company's FY2025 production forecast is required, albeit the expectation is that the final outcome will be towards the lower end of the forecast range of 70,000 - 75,000 ounces.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented\n: \"\nWe are disappointed that we have had to temporarily defer ore processing operations at Runruno due to the contamination impacting the BIOX circuit. However, we are pleased to have found the causes as to why this contamination has taken place, and are implementing additional monitoring processes to minimise the impact at present, as well as in the future.\nI would like to thank our operational team for their diligent work in identifying, and uncovering the sources of, the issue. Production is expected to be back up and running within the next two weeks, and importantly, we do not envisage the need to amend our production forecast range for 2025. Whilst it is now our expectation that we will now achieve the lower end of the forecast range, we are confident that this event will not have any long-term effects on our operations at Runruno.\"\nEND\nFor further information, please contact or visit:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nJoint Broker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nJoint Broker\nScott Mathieson, Amrit Mahbubani, Zak Wadud\nPANMURE LIBERUM\n+44\u202f(0) 20 3100 2000\nPublic Relations:\nBLYTHERAY\nMegan Ray, Said Izagare",

These artisanal miners were legally mining in the area under a co-operative (\"Cooperativa\") that owned a small portion of land within the project's mining area. Some of the artisanal miners were also mining outside of this area by encroaching into the proposed La India open-pit profile.\nThe negotiations, based on agreeing compensation for Metals Exploration to acquire the relevant land parcel and the rights of occupation, were successfully concluded in April of this year. The Company is pleased to confirm that the Cooperativa has been in full compliance of the agreement, by vacating the relevant land during July, and the agreements with the Cooperativa were successfully enacted during this period. All mining areas within the proposed La India main open- pit are now free of artisanal miners.\nNegotiations in relation to other areas occupied by artisanal miners are ongoing. Metals Exploration is working with the Nicaraguan government to find an integrated solution whereby, small and larger scale mining, can co-exist within a single tenement area for the benefit of the local community, artisanal miners and the Company. This would involve the construction of small scale facilities and the allocation of areas for artisanal miners to operate within. These areas would be uneconomic for large scale development. Under this programme the current uncontrolled environmental emissions from the small-scale gold bearing ore processing plants can be dismantled and removed thereby allowing the rehabilitation of the areas and ensuring the risks of long term environmental damages are minimised or removed completely. This programme will be carried out in accordance with international environmental standards and in conjunction with government mandates.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented\n:\n\"\nWe are pleased to have reached a fair and constructive agreement with the Cooperativa and appreciate their full compliance with the agreed terms. Our continued collaboration with the Nicaraguan government and local communities is aimed at establishing a sustainable framework where both artisanal and large-scale mining can operate side-by-side, delivering long-term benefits to all stakeholders while upholding the highest environmental and social standards.\"\n-END-\nFor further information, please contact or visit:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nJoint Broker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nJoint Broker\nScott Mathieson, Amrit Mahbubani, Zak Wadud\nPANMURE LIBERUM\n+44\u202f(0) 20 3100 2000\nPublic Relations:\nBLYTHERAY\nMegan Ray, Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204metalsexploration@blytheray.com\nWeb:\nwww.metalsexploration.com\nX:\n@MTLexploration\nLinkedIn:\nMetals Exploration\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements relating to the estimated or expected future production, operating results, cash flows and costs and financial condition of Metals Explorations, planned work at the Company's projects and the expected results of such work contained herein are forward-looking statements\nwhich are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the potential returns of the Group, industry and markets in which the Group operates in, the Directors' beliefs and assumptions made by the Directors\n.

The full amended text is shown below.\n6 August 2025\nMETALS EXPLORATION PLC\nDupax Exploration Tenement Granted, Geophysical Survey & Drilling Campaign Underway\nMetals Exploration plc (AIM: MTL) (\"Metals Exploration\" or the \"Company\") a gold production, exploration, and development company with assets in the Philippines and Nicaragua, is pleased to announce that it has been granted an exploration licence over the Dupax project area (\"Dupax\") in Northern Luzon, Philippines (Figure 1), where it has commenced an Induced Polarisation (\"IP\") ground geophysics survey and will shortly commence a 2,500 metre drill programme.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nThe newly granted tenement EP-000168 covers approximately 3,100 hectares approximately 20 kilometres (\"km\") southwest of the Company's existing Runruno ore processing facility in Runruno, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya.\n\u00b7\nIP surveying is underway over strong rock chip and trench sampling anomalies covering a 10km long geological belt containing the historical high-grade Keon open pit operation.\n\u00b7\nRock sampling shows mineralisation over a 10km strike with historical rock sample grades of up to 15.47 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, and 7% copper.\n\u00b7\nThe IP survey has been commissioned to:\no\nHelp expedite the discovery of sulphide-rich mineralisation associated with recently defined rock chip sampling anomalies; and to\no\nDefine deeper targets that may arise from mineralisation within the geological sequence from which there has been production from the historical Keon open pit operation.\n\u00b7\nA 2,500 metre drilling programme is to commence shortly, targeting outcropping high-grade mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nShould exploration at Dupax discover an economic resource, the mined ore could potentially extend ore processing operations at Runruno.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented:\n\"With the grant of EP-000168, we now control 10km of contiguous tenure only 20km south of the Runruno Operation.\n\"It is exciting to have commenced IP surveying and drilling programmes over the strong rock chip and trenching anomalies we delineated at the Dupax VMS Project.\n\"With high-grade production recorded previously from the historical Keon open pit and anomalous results over 10km of strike, there is high potential to discover an economic resource.\n\"The IP survey will be completed over the next few weeks. Drilling will commence in parallel, and we intend to use the IP data to fine-tune target locations of the maiden drilling programme.\n\"Because we already have a processing facility 20km away at Runruno, we have a great opportunity to quickly unlock value from Dupax and hopefully extend the ore processing operations at Runruno. This outcome would significantly enhance the value of both the Runruno process plant and the Dupax exploration project.\"\nThe Dupax licence area hosts an identified volcanic massive sulphide (\"VMS\") exploration target that is only approximately 20km from the existing plant infrastructure at Runruno. Should exploration at Dupax discover an economic resource, the mined ore could potentially extend ore processing operations at Runruno after ore feed from the Runruno FTAA tenement (Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement) winds down. The potential ore feed from Dupax could utilise the existing Runruno process plant infrastructure that would be re-purposed to accommodate a different type of ore feed. Any Dupax ore would likely be processed into a combination of a saleable mixed metal concentrate, plus a gold dor\u00e9 bar. The re-purposing of the Runruno plant to accommodate ore from Dupax would likely require a construction period of 6-9 months. A 5km section of the\naccess road to the Dupax project area, via the southern entry to Runruno, is currently under construction and, once completed, will facilitate haulage access should economic ore be identified.\nFigure 1: Dupax tenement location (orange) in reference to the Runruno mine site within the Runruno FTAA (red) which is operated by FCF Minerals.\nFigure 2: Dupax Project geological map showing recent rock chip sample results and trenching results.\nFigure 3: Trenching results taken across a 5 metre outcropping zone of mineralisation within the historical Keon open pit mine.\nResults from Recent Mapping, Soil and Rock Chip Sampling\nIn June 2025, Metals Exploration undertook an intensive campaign comprising rock chip sampling and detailed mapping across the Dupax tenement.

Land transport of the Rock Creek Plant to the Group's La India project area in Nicaragua is forecast to be completed during September 2025, ready for the commencement of plant erection activities now scheduled for late October 2025.\nThe Rock Creek Plant, a fit for purpose gold ore processing and concentrating plant (including crushers, conveyors, grinding ball mill, Sepro Falcon gravity circuit, carbon in leach (CIL) circuit, elution and smelting equipment and laboratory), and certain related assets, were acquired for a purchase price of US$9,700,000. The La India process flowsheet has been designed such that the Rock Creek Plant will be able to process up to 1.4 million tonnes (\"\nMt\n\") per annum, with additional built-in potential capacity to be upgraded to 1.8Mt per annum.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented\n:\n\"The ahead-of-schedule shipment of the Rock Creek Plant marks another important milestone in our fast-track development of the La India project. The efficient disassembly and early dispatch of the plant from Alaska is a testament to the commitment and capability of our team and partners. With delivery and reassembly now firmly scheduled, we remain confident in our timeline to commence plant erection in October and maintain our goal of first gold production in Q4 2026. Importantly, this continues to demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital deployment and reinforces our strategy to deliver near-term value while managing risk and cost.\"\nFor further information, please contact or visit:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nJoint Broker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nJoint Broker:\nPANMURE LIBERUM\nScott\nMathieson, Amrit Mahbubani, Zak Wadud\n+44 (0) 203100 2000\nPublic Relations:\nBLYTHERAY\nMegan Ray, Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nWeb:\nwww.metalsexploration.com\nX:\n@MTLexploration\nLinkedIn:\nMetals Exploration\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

We are pleased with the strong support we continue to receive from the Nicaraguan government and local communities, which has been critical to maintaining project development momentum. We expect to commence a resource extension drill programme in Q3 2025, which will support the next phase of value creation at this highly prospective asset.\n\"\nWe look forward to building on this momentum and updating stakeholders as we execute on our strategy in the second half of the year.\"\nRunruno Production and Finance Summary\nRunruno Project Report\nQuarter\nQuarter\nFY 2025\nFY 2024\nFY 2025\nActual\nActual\nActual\nActual\nPHYSICALS\nUnits\nQ2 2025\nQ2\u00a02024\n6 Months\n6 Months\nMining\nOre Mined\nTonnes\n524,870\n516,094\n1,028,333\n1,172,930\nWaste Mined\nTonnes\n2,456,963\n2,197,984\n4,889,310\n4,849,036\nTotal Mined\nTonnes\n2,981,833\n2,714,078\n5,917,643\n6,021,966\nAu Grade Mined\ng/tonne\n1.40\n1.39\n1.54\n1.37\nStrip Ratio\n4.52\n4.18\n4.65\n4.07\nProcessing\nOre Milled\nTonnes\n504,253\n518,440\n1,041,486\n1,099,159\nAu Grade\ng/tonne\n1.34\n1.31\n1.34\n1.34\nS2 Grade\n%\n1.21\n1.28\n1.18\n1.35\nAu Milled (contained)\nOunces\n21,702\n21,915\n44,841\n47,489\nRecovery\n%\n92.1\n89.1\n91.4\n89.6\nAu Recovered/Poured\nOunces\n19,993\n19,529\n40,985\n42,535\nSales\nAu Sold\nOunces\n23,021\n20,124\n41.240\n41,589\nAu Price\nUS$/oz\n3,061\n2,320\n2,884\n2,190\nFINANCIALS (Unaudited)\nRevenue\nGold Sales\n(US$000's)\n70,473\n46,684\n118,949\n91,085\nOperating Costs - Summary\nMining\n(US$000's)\n5,470\n4,449\n10,260\n9,609\nProcessing\n(US$000's)\n8,672\n8,413\n17,134\n17,549\nG&A\n(US$000's)\n2,531\n2,699\n6,413\n5,649\nTotal Operating Costs\n(US$000's)\n16,673\n15,561\n33,807\n32,807\nExcise Duty\n(US$000's)\n2,827\n1,872\n4,779\n3,646\nUK/Philippine G&A\n(US$000's)\n2,124\n3,100\n6,096\n4,771\nTotal Direct Production Costs\n(US$000's)\n21,624\n20,533\n44,682\n41,225\nNet Cash Income\n(US$000's)\n48,849\n26,151\n74,267\n49,861\nTotal Capital Costs\n(US$000's)\n1,641\n1,363\n3,523\n3,506\nTotal non-cash costs\n(US$000's)\n28,167\n13,183\n44,400\n27,417\nPre-tax Free Cashflow\n(\nUS$000's)\n47,208\n24,787\n70,744\n46,355\nCash Cost / oz Sold - C1\nUS$/oz\n811\n768\n839\n780\nCash Cost / oz Sold - AISC1\nUS$/oz\n1,098\n1,083\n1,189\n1,066\nNote 1: AISC includes all UK Corporate costs, excluding costs directly related to the ",

Such allocations follow the existing structure and have vesting periods based on the metrics determined by the LTIP scheme and length of tenure within the Company. It is therefore considered that tenure for the vesting should be three years of service once all benchmark performance criteria of the LTIP have been achieved.\nIt has been recommended that the number of options allocated should reflect the positions held within the Board, being 6,600,000 options for a Chairperson and 4,000,000 options for a Non-executive Director.\nPDMR Dealings\nDetails of the granted options to Steven Smith and Rob Marshall are set out below, with further information being contained in the Appendix to this announcement:\nDirector/PDMR\nNumber of LTIP options issued\nNumber of options held\nSteven Smith (Chairman)\n6,600,000\n6,600,000\nRob Marshall (Non-executive Director)\n4,000,000\n4,000,000\nLong-Term Incentive Plan Options (\"LTIP Options\")\nAt the General Meeting of shareholders held on 23 August 2024, a long-term incentive programme was approved, granting the Directors authority to issue up to 15% of the Company's issued capital as LTIP Options.\nIn accordance with this approval, LTIP Options to subscribe for, in aggregate, 318 million Ordinary Shares have been issued to certain directors and senior management of the Group to incentivise and assist in the retention of such persons for the benefit of the Company.\nLTIP Options to subscribe for 221.5 million Ordinary Shares were issued in relation to the Tranche A Options announced on 6 August 2024 and approved at the General Meeting held on 23 August 2024. The further 96.5 million LTIP Options to subscribe for Ordinary Shares were issued following the Company's acquisition of Condor Gold, both in lieu of payment of cash bonuses and in relation to incentivising the key personnel that Metals Exploration has engaged in conjunction with the acquisition.\nThe key terms of the LTIP Options are as follows\n:\n\u00b7\nExercise price: \u00a30.0001 per Ordinary Share.\n\u00b7\nExercise period: 7 years from issue.\nVesting conditions\n:\n\u00b7\nA minimum consecutive continuing employment of three years with or, as applicable, a service relationship as a non-executive director, consultant, contractor or other adviser to the Company following each performance condition summarised below having been met; and\n\u00b7\nOne-third of the options shall vest upon the earliest date following the grant date upon which the value of an Ordinary Share (based on the volume-weighted average price over a 30-day period) is at least: (i) 2.5 pence; (ii) 5.0 pence; and (iii) 7.5 pence.\nThe notifications below, made in accordance with the requirements of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (as applied in UK law), provides further detail on the transaction.\nFor further information please visit or contact:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nBroker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nPublic Relations:\nBLYTHERAY\nMegan Ray, Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nmetalsexploration@blytheray.com\nWeb:\nwww.metalsexploration.com\nX:\n@MTLexploration\nLinkedIn:\nMetals Exploration\nAppendix\nPDMR Notification Forms:\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\n1.

In Nicaragua, the Company is aiming to develop the La India gold project.\nGroup vision & mission statement\nThe Group's vision is to be the most admired gold producer in the Philippines and Nicaragua. Our mission is to\nenhance the lives of our people and local communities through the responsible management of our natural resources, to build a multi-project business and to deliver performance that stakeholders are proud of.\nWell-defined values embedded into the business processes and structures along with consistent leadership actions and behaviours provide the foundation for corporate culture and its subsequent success.

This was executed through the successful acquisitions of Condor Gold Plc (\"Condor\") and the YMC Group (\"YMC\").\nFirst, we must start with the strong performance at Runruno, which produced 83,897 oz of gold in 2024, exceeding the upper end production guidance for the year. This resulted in record gold revenue of $191.1 million, and record free cashflow of $96.7 million, supported by the strong gold price seen in 2024. The Company is currently debt free, a significant milestone for us.\nI am also very pleased to report to shareholders that for the year ended 31 December 2024, your Company achieved net adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges of US$98.7 million (2023: US$82.6 million). The excellent financial results are a testament to the impressive work conducted by the management team, led by our CEO, Darren Bowden, and the entire workforce in the Philippines.\nThe continued excellent performance at Runruno has allowed us to deliver on our strategy of executing M&A opportunities to ensure continued value for our shareholders through sustained cashflow generation. The Board has a clear growth plan in place and is implementing this strategy with the longevity of the business in mind. In December 2024, the Company announced its intention to acquire Condor, owner of the La India gold project in Nicaragua. This acquisition was completed in January 2025. In August 2024 we also acq",

There was also an increase in our processing operations compared to the previous quarter, with gold production of 20,992 ounces in Q1 2025. This was an excellent start to the year, and we hope to continue with this strong performance as the year goes on.\n\"\nUnfortunately, one of our colleagues at Runruno suffered an injury at the end of March and is undergoing medical care in Manilla. We are investigating how this incident occurred and will support him during his recovery. Safety of our employees is our number one priority, and we are saddened by this news.\"\nRunruno Production and Finance Summary\nRunruno Project Report\nQuarter\nQuarter\nFY 2025\nFY 2024\nFY 2025\nActual\nActual\nActual\nActual\nPHYSICALS\nUnits\nQ1 2025\nQ1\u00a02024\n3 Months\n3 Months\nMining\nOre Mined\nTonnes\n503,463\n677,663\n503,463\n677,663\nWaste Mined\nTonnes\n2,432,347\n2,630,225\n2,432,347\n2,630,225\nTotal Mined\nTonnes\n2,935,810\n3,307,888\n2,935,810\n3,307,888\nAu Grade Mined\ng/tonne\n1.69\n1.35\n1.69\n1.35\nStrip Ratio\n4.79\n3.99\n4.79\n3.99\nProcessing\nOre Milled\nTonnes\n537,233\n580,719\n537,233\n580,719\nAu Grade\ng/tonne\n1.34\n1.37\n1.34\n1.37\nS2 Grade\n%\n1.16\n1.41\n1.16\n1.41\nAu Milled (contained)\nOunces\n23,139\n25,574\n23,139\n25,574\nRecovery\n%\n90.7\n90.0\n90.7\n90.0\nAu Recovered/Poured\nOunces\n20,992\n23,006\n20,992\n23,006\nSales\nAu Sold\nOunces\n18,219\n21,465\n18,219\n21,465\nAu Price\nUS$/oz\n2,661\n2,069\n2,661\n2,069\nFINANCIALS (Unaudited)\nRevenue\nGold Sales\n(US$000's)\n48,476\n44,401\n48,476\n44,401\nOperating Costs - Summary\nMining\n(US$000's)\n4,790\n5,160\n4,790\n5,160\nProcessing\n(US$000's)\n8,463\n9,136\n8,463\n9,136\nG&A\n(US$000's)\n3,882\n2,950\n3,882\n2,950\nTotal Operating Costs\n(US$000's)\n17,134\n17,246\n17,134\n17,246\nExcise Duty\n(US$000's)\n1,952\n1,774\n1,952\n1,774\nUK/Philippine G&A\n(US$000's)\n3,972\n1,671\n3,972\n1,671\nTotal Direct Production Costs\n(US$000's)\n23,058\n20,691\n23,058\n20,691\nNet Cash Income\n(US$000's)\n27,8",

The Sustainability Report covers the Group's sustainability performance in the Philippines for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nView the\u00a0Sustainability Report at:\nhttps://metalsexploration.com/esg/esg-overview/\nThe FCF Sustainability Report was previously biennial, but the Company has taken the decision to update this to an annual publication to further enhance transparency and accountability. The Sustainability Report covers progress over the year, the Company's outlook for the future, and presents FCF Minerals' initiatives, targets, milestones, challenges, and impacts during the year, highlighting what matters for its stakeholders based on a refined materiality assessment.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nEconomic contributions increased by 18% to PHP 10.97 billion (approximately US$146 million), with products and services sourced from host communities totalling PHP 190.34 million (approximately US$2.5 million).\n\u00b7\nSafety of employees is fundamental, with over 25 million man-hours worked without a lost time injury occurring. This represents a 15% increase in safe man-hours from 2023.\n\u00b7\nLocal community and infrastructure investments through the Company's Social Development and Management Programme (\"\nSDMP\n\") totalled PHP 86.38 million (approximately US$1.2 million), an increase of 13% from 2023. The SDMP encompasses education, health, livelihood and infrastructure development, and supported 10 communities in 2024.\no\nFCF purchased, delivered and installed 65 units of serviceable solar lights to monitor security and safety of road users.\no\nIn one community, FCF installed functional pipelines and accessories to improve availability of clean water for domestic use and sanitation.\no\nFCF developed a hanging footbridge for two barangays to increase access for schoolchildren.\n\u00b7\nFCF's habitat restoration programme continued to grow, with 6.62 hectares of land restored to its original habitat, representing a 27% increase from 2023. 56.56 hectares of disturbed land was restored, over 13,000 trees were donated from the FCF nursery to the community, and 871 hectares of habitat areas were protected.\n\u00b7\nFCF strives to increase environmental responsibility, and in 2024 saw water consumption decrease by 10.97% and total GHG emissions decrease by 15.10% from 2023.\n\u00b7\nThe Group has 853 total employees, an increase of 10.5% from 2023.\nOver 98% of the workforce is comprised of Filipino employees.\n\u00b7\nThe Company's commitment to create long-term positive impacts for its stakeholders was recognised again in 2024, through the receipt of a number of prestigious awards, including the Presidential Mineral Industry Environmental Award in the Surface Mining Operation Category, for the third year in a row, the highest government mining award attainable in the Philippines.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented\n:\n\"I am immensely proud of the contents of this report and the work that was carried out by FCF Minerals in 2024. Our core focus is to enhance the lives of our people and local communities through the responsible management of our natural resources. We remain committed to our objective of fostering inclusive economic growth within our communities through the prioritisation of local procurement and employment opportunities, along with investments in infrastructure development, education, training programmes, and livelihood assistance.\n\"I encourage all shareholders and stakeholders to read the report as it will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the work that FCF Minerals is conducting to create net positive outcomes for all of our stakeholders.\n\"Thank you to all our local stakeholders and partners for their ongoing support.

This follows the successful completion of the settlement agreement with Runruno Holdings Limited (\"RHL\") which resulted in the RHL shareholding being bought out by the Company (completed in September 2024) as well as the settlement of all the various debt disputes with the Company's lenders resulting in the Company becoming debt free in June 2024.\nMr Steven Smith has been appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board replacing Mr von Schirnding.\nIn addition, the Company announces, further to the completion of its recommended acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Condor Gold plc (\"Condor Gold\"), which was effected by way of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 on 15 January 2025 (the \"Acquisition\"), an update to its statements of intent made pursuant to Rules 2.7(c)(viii) and 24.2(a)(ii) to (iii) of the Code, which were set out in its announcement of 4 December 2024 (the \"2.7 Announcement\") and the scheme document published in connection with the Acquisition on 11 December 2024 (the \"Scheme Document\" and, together with the 2.7 Announcement, the \"Offer Documentation\").\nUnless otherwise defined, capitalised terms in this announcement have the meanings given in the Scheme Document.\nThe Offer Documentation stated that it was intended that shortly following the Effective Date Jim Mellon would be appointed to the board of MTL as a non-executive director, subject to satisfactory completion of the usual due diligence process required by the AIM Rules.\nHowever, the Company has since been advised that Mr Jim Mellon no longer wishes to join the MTL Board. After consideration of his other commitments and the requirement to attend Metals Exploration Board meetings in both the Philippines and Nicaragua, Mr Mellon considers that he does not have adequate time to devote to the Company, especially in terms of travel requirements.\nSteven Smith, Non-Executive Chair of Metals Exploration, commented\n:\n\"It has been a pleasure to work with Nick von Schirnding and I would like to thank him for his contribution over the past year especially for his efforts in helping the Company complete a significant restructuring of the Company's ownership.

Following the Facility Repayment, the Company is debt-free.\nChange of Significant Shareholder Interest and Related Party Transaction\nAs a result of the transfer of the Repayment Shares, Drachs is interested in 429,659,997 Ordinary Shares, representing 16.12% of the Company's total voting rights. The TR-1 notification form is shown below.\nDrachs is a substantial shareholder and the Facility Repayment is therefore deemed a related party transaction pursuant to the AIM Rules. The independent Directors of the Company, being Nick von Schirnding, Darren Bowden, Steven Smith, Timothy Livesey, Andrew Chubb and David Cather, having consulted with Strand Hanson Limited, the Company's Nominated Adviser, consider the terms of the Facility Amendment to be fair and reasonable insofar as shareholders of the Company are concerned.\nTotal Voting Rights\nAs a result of the transfer from treasury of the Repayment Shares, the Company has 2,965,438,788 Ordinary Shares in issue, of which 299,385,458 Ordinary Shares are held in treasury, and, accordingly, the total number of voting rights is 2,666,065,330. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculation by which they may determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nDarren Bowden, CEO of Metals Exploration, commented:\n\"We are very grateful for the ongoing support from Drachs. The provision of an unsecured bridging facility at short notice last November was a key element in enabling the Company to secure the Condor Gold board's support for our takeover offer. Their decision to convert the loan into shares at a premium to the market price and 30-day VWAP underlines their confidence in our growth potential and future plans. We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with Drachs as we advance our projects in the Philippines and Nicaragua.\"\nFor further information, please contact or visit:\nMetals Exploration PLC\nVia BlytheRay\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNominated & Financial Adviser:\nSTRAND HANSON LIMITED\nJames Spinney, James Dance, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nBroker:\nHANNAM & PARTNERS\nMatt Hasson, Franck Nganou\n+44 (0) 207\n907 8500\nPublic Relations:\nBLYTHERAY\nMegan Ray, Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nWeb:\nwww.metalsexploration.com\nX:\n@MTLexploration\nLinkedIn:\nMetals Exploration\nTR-1: S\ntandard form for notification of major holdings\nNOTIFICATION OF MAJOR HOLDINGS\n(to be sent to the relevant issuer\nand\nto the FCA in Microsoft Word format if possible) i\n1a.

I've been waiting fir many MANY years for La India to get up and running / realise some fair value - if the proposition for value add here was dupax I would be out as well. That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

When the momentum fades due to lack of progress/news, we get traded like a penny share.

It is an area of proven reserves historically and high grade ore, so we know there is gold, just need to locate exactly where. This is supported by the geological data of the area as well as their physics studies People have been interfering with the project, which has caused delays. Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim. The only question I have left is whether Sakura's title is Duchess or Baroness after reading her comments of her life",

Current mine has 4-5 years left at 90k oz pa waiting on update to see if this can be extended another 5 years, 2nd mine PFS shows 12 year LOM @ 90oz Pa, 3rd mine early stage speculation potentially another 10yr + LOM @90k oz pour 2031 - so it is very comparable to MTL.

My worry started when IG removed all trading fees, now they have removed annual fees, and also pay interest on any balance not invested, so how do they make money? They sound more like a bank than a broker, as in my funds are not actually in their hands, and being used elsewhere making a higher interest for them, I moved to HL because they charge for trades, and now have annual fees, sounds more like a broker which I like, when something is free, like IG I get suspicious. Thoughts welcome.",

The Government has been pushing for years to abolish all paper shares. The shares are harder to trade and more expensive to do so in paper form, which could cause a problem if you needed to sell quickly. As you said, your broker will not wish to assist you as you would be taking the shares out of your account with them. Another issue is if your shares are held in an ISA. They would need to come out of the ISA and you would lose their Capital Gains immunity whenever you sell any of them. I would also like to hold my shares in my name, but paper certificates is not the way. It was previously possible to do this by holding your shares in  a personal CREST account. This was considerably more expensive than a broker nominee account, but nobody seems to offer this service any more.",

I suspect in light of gold price it will be economic to mine material at lower grades of gold in the current pit. $5300 changes a lot of dynamics and i am sure Runruno can run on $2500 AISC very nicely at these levels.

Perhaps it might rejig the workers, I don't see how this could raise more income to the gov to pay off us interest repayment. Also, EU seems to have sped up the India trade deal, which is a major good news for Russia, even though EU says they need to exclude Russian crude, whilst russian crude probably will be used for domestic and others exported to EU at a higher price. It also has to be noted Modi and Putin was hugging each other just a month before. And us actually raised tariff on India because of imported crude from Russia. Whilst China gets shafted with human rights stuff, India on the other hand is pretty much oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. Perhaps EU could agree on it.

In just 6 hours of trading today, over 8 million MTL shares have changed hands for around \u00a31.3m, thereby reducing the share price by 6% and the book value MTL (from around \u00a3500m) by \u00a330m. Do the maths. People invest for all sorts of reasons. Some focus on the short term, others take the long view. Some chase capital growth, while others prefer the steady comfort of dividends. Whatever your motivation, it\u2019s worth taking the time to research, reflect, and build a strategy that fits your own goals rather than reacting to noise or emotion. Weekhands and short-termism make for skittish investing.  After all, knee\u2011jerk reactions tend to be made by people acting like jerks. I'm backing the current management of MTL to make the right calls. Keep your powder dry and buy on the dips.",

But if Darren does make regular updates this year and continues to re-iterate first pour at La India in Q4 and expected annual production 145k oz then 2027 would have our annual profit at not much less than current market cap. So I'm with Lee on this one, 1p rise on each monthly update and then a bigger re-rating when first pour is announced",

I've been waiting fir many MANY years for La India to get up and running / realise some fair value - if the proposition for value add here was dupax I would be out as well. That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

However, a spate of bad news from end of September 25 slowed down the momentum and we did drift between 12p and 14p. This is what I meant. When the momentum fades due to lack of progress/news, we get traded like a penny share. However, 30P by La India first pour would also be good enough for me although I may have to delay my retirement benefits. As always, thanks for the encouragement.",

It is an area of proven reserves historically and high grade ore, so we know there is gold, just need to locate exactly where. This is supported by the geological data of the area as well as their physics studies People have been interfering with the project, which has caused delays. Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim. The only question I have left is whether Sakura's title is Duchess or Baroness after reading her comments of her life",

I've been waiting fir many MANY years for La India to get up and running / realise some fair value - if the proposition for value add here was dupax I would be out as well. That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

Bloody handy for Metals investors to have bought Condor :) Imagine the scene if everything was riding on Dupax. At same time Condor shareholders can thank their socks the friggin mine is getting built at Arguably best time in last 20 years. Also hope Metals drops an RNS about some way forward as otherwise 1000s of staff will be staring at a P45 end of the year and i am sure government and community will do something to keep mine operating. Lot more pressure for Darren that i think be quite enjoys but Dupax should come together.",

Current mine has 4-5 years left at 90k oz pa waiting on update to see if this can be extended another 5 years, 2nd mine PFS shows 12 year LOM @ 90oz Pa, 3rd mine early stage speculation potentially another 10yr + LOM @90k oz pour 2031 - so it is very comparable to MTL.

We know the US are likely to add $2.5 trillion to the current debt in the next 12 months, another $3 Trillion the year after, and so on, gold will happily track and rise as the debt grows both bigger with ever larger chunks higher each year, Trump has already admitted that\u2019s not an issue for him, and hence the rush to safety, this bull run will last, and those in the banking system know it, hence the central bank buying, the dollar has lost 99% of its purchasing power in just 55 years, that\u2019s a fact, the last percent is now losing its value. Stay with gold, it\u2019s proven itself already.",

          "content": "Thanks for the reply Ken, it\u2019s not hard to materialise shares (share certs to trading platform) as the brokers want your business, HL do it for free, they just don\u2019t offer it the other way, for obvious reasons as they can\u2019t make money from you if you leave, the share cert is a legal document that shows your share holding of the company, I don\u2019t plan on selling MTL in the next 5 years, I feel the share certificate as safer than having them in a broker, HL have assured me the shares are in my name and that the funds are held safely, but I still worry if the banks go bust, and the funds are in that bank, it would be difficult getting those funds back. My worry started when IG removed all trading fees, now they have removed annual fees, and also pay interest on any balance not invested, so how do they make money? They sound more like a bank than a broker, as in my funds are not actually in their hands, and being used elsewhere making a higher interest for them, I moved to HL because they charge for trades, and now have annual fees, sounds more like a broker which I like, when something is free, like IG I get suspicious. Thoughts welcome.",

The Government has been pushing for years to abolish all paper shares. The shares are harder to trade and more expensive to do so in paper form, which could cause a problem if you needed to sell quickly. As you said, your broker will not wish to assist you as you would be taking the shares out of your account with them. Another issue is if your shares are held in an ISA. They would need to come out of the ISA and you would lose their Capital Gains immunity whenever you sell any of them. I would also like to hold my shares in my name, but paper certificates is not the way. It was previously possible to do this by holding your shares in  a personal CREST account. This was considerably more expensive than a broker nominee account, but nobody seems to offer this service any more.",

I suspect in light of gold price it will be economic to mine material at lower grades of gold in the current pit. $5300 changes a lot of dynamics and i am sure Runruno can run on $2500 AISC very nicely at these levels.

Apologies if you found it not worthy and perhaps i should ask your permission in future.

That is it's popularity is it's selling point more than anything else Also bitcoin or crypto will be competing against government backed digital currency. Imagine doing maths with divisible bitcoin. Also fiat currency has it's uses to government, that is inflation and deflationary measures and most of all people forget they want government or some orgs to be in power, because there is just that sense of security that other orga can't provide. That is we all want government in one form or another. Also BlackRock bitcoin holdings is basically 1% of entire port. If it goes to zero it just doesn't matter to them. They got in because of the liquidity opportunity. Also",

Chilliboots has observed that we have seen a big change in the approach to Dupax. Initially we are told there will be a rolling release of drill results. Then everything goes quiet although we get a photo of some drill cores. Corporate presentations barely mention Dupax and the drill results never come.  Some talk about monsoon damage and now it\u2019s all about a recalcitrant community who are known to be politically motivated. We never did get the drill results.

I'm guessing that he's deliberately playing down Dupax since I suspect the impediment is not the stuff in the ground but the grouchy locals.  Interesting point he made about the politics.  Sounds like the local power centre is sympathetic to the previous regime - Duterte - which was China friendly.  Given politics over there tends to be buggins turn there is every possibility that the China huggers come back to power in Manilla and the Chinese will come round sniffing for good opportunities. Keeping Dupax's potential understated might put them off.  Otherwise the resource could be whipped out from under their noses.",

It signifies that he believes Bitcoin is not just dangerous or useless (\"rat poison\") but exceptionally so (\"squared\"), viewing it as a speculative, non-productive bubble that will likely end in disaster. It's a classic pyramid scheme that can only continue if another fool pays more than the last fool for it. Remember BTC is not a physical thing that has utility, it exists as a bunch of electrons on a network of computers. Almost nobody accepts BTC as a currency of trade. If I had some, where could I spend them? Something that can fluctuate +/- as much as 10% or more in a day is not an investment, it's simply a gamble. For those that own it, I wish you luck.

In his view AI could raise productivity and not trigger inflation. Whilst AI could raise productivity perhaps in certain sectors. Coding, health diagnosis and autonomous robots. It has to be noted that there will also be creation of new jobs, like prompt technician and quality control AI. Perhaps it might rejig the workers, I don't see how this could raise more income to the gov to pay off us interest repayment. Also, EU seems to have sped up the India trade deal, which is a major good news for Russia, even though EU says they need to exclude Russian crude, whilst russian crude probably will be used for domestic and others exported to EU at a higher price. It also has to be noted Modi and Putin was hugging each other just a month before. And us actually raised tariff on India because of imported crude from Russia. Whilst China gets shafted with human rights stuff, India on the other hand is pretty much oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. Perhaps EU could agree on it. Just my macro view, but geopolitical tension is shifting but unsure of stability.",

Within a one-year time frame, we should have La India producing 2-3 times the quantity at around 2/3rd of the cost/oz. In just 6 hours of trading today, over 8 million MTL shares have changed hands for around \u00a31.3m, thereby reducing the share price by 6% and the book value MTL (from around \u00a3500m) by \u00a330m. Do the maths. People invest for all sorts of reasons. Some focus on the short term, others take the long view. Some chase capital growth, while others prefer the steady comfort of dividends. Whatever your motivation, it\u2019s worth taking the time to research, reflect, and build a strategy that fits your own goals rather than reacting to noise or emotion. Weekhands and short-termism make for skittish investing.  After all, knee\u2011jerk reactions tend to be made by people acting like jerks. I'm backing the current management of MTL to make the right calls. Keep your powder dry and buy on the dips.",

When something very tangible happens they often spike in price, frequently going parabolic and then collapsing when the actual production doesn't follow on time. With Runruno in terminal decline we're being valued as a pure explorer. But if Darren does make regular updates this year and continues to re-iterate first pour at La India in Q4 and expected annual production 145k oz then 2027 would have our annual profit at not much less than current market cap. So I'm with Lee on this one, 1p rise on each monthly update and then a bigger re-rating when first pour is announced",

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

I\u2019m going off memory here and don\u2019t feel like or have time to check it exactly. The issue with the environmentalists in Dupax seems to be bigger than expected, and the processes in the Philippines seem very complicated and arbitrary... So again: finish Runruno, prepare everything in Nicaragua in the meantime, and then start with the move.",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

Bloody handy for Metals investors to have bought Condor :) Imagine the scene if everything was riding on Dupax. At same time Condor shareholders can thank their socks the friggin mine is getting built at Arguably best time in last 20 years. Also hope Metals drops an RNS about some way forward as otherwise 1000s of staff will be staring at a P45 end of the year and i am sure government and community will do something to keep mine operating.

Current mine has 4-5 years left at 90k oz pa waiting on update to see if this can be extended another 5 years, 2nd mine PFS shows 12 year LOM @ 90oz Pa, 3rd mine early stage speculation potentially another 10yr + LOM @90k oz pour 2031 - so it is very comparable to MTL.

My worry started when IG removed all trading fees, now they have removed annual fees, and also pay interest on any balance not invested, so how do they make money? They sound more like a bank than a broker, as in my funds are not actually in their hands, and being used elsewhere making a higher interest for them, I moved to HL because they charge for trades, and now have annual fees, sounds more like a broker which I like, when something is free, like IG I get suspicious. Thoughts welcome.",

If you did this at the end of the last bull run in 1980 and assumed an ever increasing POG you would have lost your shirt. We are in unprecedented times but not sure MTL should be chasing resources at marginal rates requiring a POG over $4k. Cool heads required. Dupax should be a reminder to us all that the future is rarely as good as we hope or as bad as we fear!",

The Government has been pushing for years to abolish all paper shares. The shares are harder to trade and more expensive to do so in paper form, which could cause a problem if you needed to sell quickly. As you said, your broker will not wish to assist you as you would be taking the shares out of your account with them. Another issue is if your shares are held in an ISA. They would need to come out of the ISA and you would lose their Capital Gains immunity whenever you sell any of them. I would also like to hold my shares in my name, but paper certificates is not the way. It was previously possible to do this by holding your shares in  a personal CREST account. This was considerably more expensive than a broker nominee account, but nobody seems to offer this service any more.",

I suspect in light of gold price it will be economic to mine material at lower grades of gold in the current pit. $5300 changes a lot of dynamics and i am sure Runruno can run on $2500 AISC very nicely at these levels.

G7 central banks don\u2019t buy gold - that\u2019s 25% of global GDP - other central bank purchases slowed last year (not stoped as I previously posted) the rise above $5k is driven by retail and ETF flows - it may well go higher but as we have seen this rise will be be volatile. Silver is heavily manipulated, it always has been, and can\u2019t be trusted. Gold has its uses as an asset  and has partially replaced Treasuries but it can\u2019t fully replace it . The price of gold is not the most important factor in MTLs share price - derisking and reducing the risk discount to increase the PE ratio could give us an exponential increase not the linear increase we get from a rising gold price!",

Blockchain is practicable in some use cases but the value of the byproduct (crypto) to be traded is not necessary.

When the power supplies or internet are destroyed, you can\u2019t use bitcoin, look at Ukraine as an example, they have neither in many parts of the country, they will be bartering with valuables or ever shrinking paper notes, how long do we expect the internet to function in a major war, the fibre optics in the seas would be the first to go, then the powerstations, imagine what happens to bitcoins price then?

The only way gvnts can control de centralised Bitcoin is to buy it. What do we think happens then? Tokenisation is happening and it is blockchain that enables it.

Compare their graph over 20 years to gold! The internet was laughed now it is a part of daily life. Currently I am more bullish on gold than crypto but that will change.

Just for you: Gold was used for thousands of years, so was silver as money, it\u2019s because of the metals physical makeup it was chosen, because it\u2019s doesn\u2019t lose weight with age, it cannot be broken down, the weight of the metals determines the wealth of the person holding it, it worked perfectly for thousands of years and still does today, the paper note has been sold to recent generations as money, and today people have forgotten that it\u2019s not money, the note was a promise to repay the holder the same value in gold, which they did, until the governments had printed so many notes secretly, they could not pay back the gold promised, and defaulted, leaving those holding paper instead of gold. The lack of understanding on this fact is why the world is suffering a consistent lack of purchasing power with these notes, and hence we now need $5000 notes to buy that ounce of gold that only required $42 notes to buy that same ounce in 1971. The printing of new notes is now gaining speed as the debts spiral, and the realisation of the fact these notes have and will continue to lose purchasing power, that\u2019s why both silver and gold will increase in value, and the media still doesn\u2019t educate todays population correctly. The central banks understand it, the Asian population understand it, and those on this platform most likely understand it unless your name is Major ;-)",

The lack of understanding on this fact is why the world is suffering a consistent lack of purchasing power with these notes, and hence we now need $5000 notes to buy that ounce of gold that only required $42 notes to buy that same ounce in 1971. The printing of new notes is now gaining speed as the debts spiral, and the realisation of the fact these notes have and will continue to lose purchasing power, that\u2019s why both silver and gold will increase in value, and the media still doesn\u2019t educate todays population correctly. The central banks understand it, the Asian population understand it, and those on this platform most likely understand it, it\u2019s not a gold bug theory, it\u2019s just fact.",

My own guess is that we will probably peak at somewhere in the $140 - $180 area, rather than where Michael Oliver sits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw78V5Er3XU At the moment I think (hope) that we will stay in a step consolidation phase for a few weeks (say $80 - $100) before moving into the next level $100 - $125, perhaps associated with a strong COMEX delivery. As for gold, it looks like it's setting up for a slow, steady (and healthy) recovery. I think $5,500 is pretty much baked in, but I don't think a peak of $6,000 is out of the question. Meanwhile MTL's share price is still languishing at 15p - 16p. With the wind of gold and silver in the right direction, and first gold expected in Q4 (I wouldn't be surprised with an August or September announcement), we could see a stellar November\\December; perhaps even a 30p share price as we close in on 2027 production.",

As for America, I acknowledge Trump's backing for what it's worth. He also promised to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of being elected, and issued ludicrous import taxes on any country that upset him. He has still failed to deliver on Ukraine and reversed or reduced many of the new import taxes. Trump unfortunately suffers from a God complex; he thinks that he only has to say something for it to become true.",

In that case, there would not have been so much speculation and expectations. However, it will be interesting to see  how the employees at Runruno would react to the news that the plant will be moved out of the country totally and they will have no employment. If there is no progress after 3 months, then we will become a one trick pony with a high risk mine in Nic and I myself might decide to move some of my gains to other miners to reduce my exposure. Time will tell.",

That is it's popularity is it's selling point more than anything else Also bitcoin or crypto will be competing against government backed digital currency. Imagine doing maths with divisible bitcoin. Also fiat currency has it's uses to government, that is inflation and deflationary measures and most of all people forget they want government or some orgs to be in power, because there is just that sense of security that other orga can't provide. That is we all want government in one form or another. Also BlackRock bitcoin holdings is basically 1% of entire port. If it goes to zero it just doesn't matter to them.

There is also what like 20 million cryptos out there. Bitcoin itself when you look at it looks like a barcode but heavily marketed as a gold coin via images, to draw its analogy to gold. That is it's popularity is it's selling point more than anything else Also bitcoin or crypto will be competing against government backed digital currency. Imagine doing maths with divisible bitcoin. Also fiat currency has it's uses to government, that is inflation and deflationary measures and most of all people forget they want government or some orgs to be in power, because there is just that sense of security that other orga can't provide. That is we all want government in one form or another. Also BlackRock bitcoin holdings is basically 1% of entire port. If it goes to zero it just doesn't matter to them. They got in because of the liquidity opportunity. Also",

Chilliboots has observed that we have seen a big change in the approach to Dupax. Initially we are told there will be a rolling release of drill results. Then everything goes quiet although we get a photo of some drill cores. Corporate presentations barely mention Dupax and the drill results never come.  Some talk about monsoon damage and now it\u2019s all about a recalcitrant community who are known to be politically motivated. We never did get the drill results.

I'm guessing that he's deliberately playing down Dupax since I suspect the impediment is not the stuff in the ground but the grouchy locals.  Interesting point he made about the politics.  Sounds like the local power centre is sympathetic to the previous regime - Duterte - which was China friendly.  Given politics over there tends to be buggins turn there is every possibility that the China huggers come back to power in Manilla and the Chinese will come round sniffing for good opportunities. Keeping Dupax's potential understated might put them off.  Otherwise the resource could be whipped out from under their noses.",

It signifies that he believes Bitcoin is not just dangerous or useless (\"rat poison\") but exceptionally so (\"squared\"), viewing it as a speculative, non-productive bubble that will likely end in disaster. It's a classic pyramid scheme that can only continue if another fool pays more than the last fool for it. Remember BTC is not a physical thing that has utility, it exists as a bunch of electrons on a network of computers. Almost nobody accepts BTC as a currency of trade. If I had some, where could I spend them? Something that can fluctuate +/- as much as 10% or more in a day is not an investment, it's simply a gamble. For those that own it, I wish you luck.

In his view AI could raise productivity and not trigger inflation. Whilst AI could raise productivity perhaps in certain sectors. Coding, health diagnosis and autonomous robots. It has to be noted that there will also be creation of new jobs, like prompt technician and quality control AI. Perhaps it might rejig the workers, I don't see how this could raise more income to the gov to pay off us interest repayment. Also, EU seems to have sped up the India trade deal, which is a major good news for Russia, even though EU says they need to exclude Russian crude, whilst russian crude probably will be used for domestic and others exported to EU at a higher price. It also has to be noted Modi and Putin was hugging each other just a month before. And us actually raised tariff on India because of imported crude from Russia. Whilst China gets shafted with human rights stuff, India on the other hand is pretty much oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. Perhaps EU could agree on it. Just my macro view, but geopolitical tension is shifting but unsure of stability.",

Within a one-year time frame, we should have La India producing 2-3 times the quantity at around 2/3rd of the cost/oz. In just 6 hours of trading today, over 8 million MTL shares have changed hands for around \u00a31.3m, thereby reducing the share price by 6% and the book value MTL (from around \u00a3500m) by \u00a330m. Do the maths. People invest for all sorts of reasons. Some focus on the short term, others take the long view. Some chase capital growth, while others prefer the steady comfort of dividends. Whatever your motivation, it\u2019s worth taking the time to research, reflect, and build a strategy that fits your own goals rather than reacting to noise or emotion. Weekhands and short-termism make for skittish investing.  After all, knee\u2011jerk reactions tend to be made by people acting like jerks. I'm backing the current management of MTL to make the right calls. Keep your powder dry and buy on the dips.",

When something very tangible happens they often spike in price, frequently going parabolic and then collapsing when the actual production doesn't follow on time. With Runruno in terminal decline we're being valued as a pure explorer. But if Darren does make regular updates this year and continues to re-iterate first pour at La India in Q4 and expected annual production 145k oz then 2027 would have our annual profit at not much less than current market cap. So I'm with Lee on this one, 1p rise on each monthly update and then a bigger re-rating when first pour is announced",

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

Thanks to PoG my other mining stocks have helped drive my SIPP through \u00a32m. It's taken 35 years to get here for me from when I was 21.

Bloody handy for Metals investors to have bought Condor :) Imagine the scene if everything was riding on Dupax. At same time Condor shareholders can thank their socks the friggin mine is getting built at Arguably best time in last 20 years. Also hope Metals drops an RNS about some way forward as otherwise 1000s of staff will be staring at a P45 end of the year and i am sure government and community will do something to keep mine operating. Lot more pressure for Darren that i think be quite enjoys but Dupax should come together.",

My worry started when IG removed all trading fees, now they have removed annual fees, and also pay interest on any balance not invested, so how do they make money? They sound more like a bank than a broker, as in my funds are not actually in their hands, and being used elsewhere making a higher interest for them, I moved to HL because they charge for trades, and now have annual fees, sounds more like a broker which I like, when something is free, like IG I get suspicious. Thoughts welcome.",

Dupax should be a reminder to us all that the future is rarely as good as we hope or as bad as we fear!",

The Government has been pushing for years to abolish all paper shares. The shares are harder to trade and more expensive to do so in paper form, which could cause a problem if you needed to sell quickly. As you said, your broker will not wish to assist you as you would be taking the shares out of your account with them. Another issue is if your shares are held in an ISA. They would need to come out of the ISA and you would lose their Capital Gains immunity whenever you sell any of them. I would also like to hold my shares in my name, but paper certificates is not the way. It was previously possible to do this by holding your shares in  a personal CREST account. This was considerably more expensive than a broker nominee account, but nobody seems to offer this service any more.",

I suspect in light of gold price it will be economic to mine material at lower grades of gold in the current pit. $5300 changes a lot of dynamics and i am sure Runruno can run on $2500 AISC very nicely at these levels.

Looks like the mine plan is underground then ends with an open pit according to the JORC report. However from the JORC report the mine plan suggests only 800ktonnes pa of material. This is a lot less than what Runruno plant can handle. Unless they can amend the plan or add more resources into the plan it doesn't look big enough.",

G7 central banks don\u2019t buy gold - that\u2019s 25% of global GDP - other central bank purchases slowed last year (not stoped as I previously posted) the rise above $5k is driven by retail and ETF flows - it may well go higher but as we have seen this rise will be be volatile. Silver is heavily manipulated, it always has been, and can\u2019t be trusted. Gold has its uses as an asset  and has partially replaced Treasuries but it can\u2019t fully replace it . The price of gold is not the most important factor in MTLs share price - derisking and reducing the risk discount to increase the PE ratio could give us an exponential increase not the linear increase we get from a rising gold price!",

G7 central banks don\u2019t buy gold - that\u2019s 25% of global GDP - other central bank purchases slowed last year (not stoped as I previously posted) the rise above $5k is driven by retail and ETF flows - it may well go higher but as we have seen this rise will be be volatile. Silver is heavily manipulated, it always has been, and can\u2019t be trusted. Gold has its uses as an asset  and has partially replaced Treasuries but it can\u2019t fully replace it . The price of gold is not the most important factor in MTLs share price - derisking and reducing the risk discount to increase the PE ratio could give us an exponential increase not the linear increase we get from a rising gold price!",

The government do have bitcoin and all that was from seizure from people who didn't follow the said laws of the country, so buying it doesn't really make too much sense to the government. Blockchain is practicable in some use cases but the value of the byproduct (crypto) to be traded is not necessary. Microstrategy I imagine will head to bankruptcy, because they are basically using leverage to buy bitcoin and their fundamental ib business does not make money.",

I know this sounds mad max but when you have wars which would you prefer to be using? A computer based system or a piece of gold? When the power supplies or internet are destroyed, you can\u2019t use bitcoin, look at Ukraine as an example, they have neither in many parts of the country, they will be bartering with valuables or ever shrinking paper notes, how long do we expect the internet to function in a major war, the fibre optics in the seas would be the first to go, then the powerstations, imagine what happens to bitcoins price then? Imagine how high gold goes then? I hope we never see such things, but physical assets will be the only wealth preserver.",

The only way gvnts can control de centralised Bitcoin is to buy it. What do we think happens then? Tokenisation is happening and it is blockchain that enables it.

Compare their graph over 20 years to gold! The internet was laughed now it is a part of daily life. Currently I am more bullish on gold than crypto but that will change.

Just for you: Gold was used for thousands of years, so was silver as money, it\u2019s because of the metals physical makeup it was chosen, because it\u2019s doesn\u2019t lose weight with age, it cannot be broken down, the weight of the metals determines the wealth of the person holding it, it worked perfectly for thousands of years and still does today, the paper note has been sold to recent generations as money, and today people have forgotten that it\u2019s not money, the note was a promise to repay the holder the same value in gold, which they did, until the governments had printed so many notes secretly, they could not pay back the gold promised, and defaulted, leaving those holding paper instead of gold. The lack of understanding on this fact is why the world is suffering a consistent lack of purchasing power with these notes, and hence we now need $5000 notes to buy that ounce of gold that only required $42 notes to buy that same ounce in 1971. The printing of new notes is now gaining speed as the debts spiral, and the realisation of the fact these notes have and will continue to lose purchasing power, that\u2019s why both silver and gold will increase in value, and the media still doesn\u2019t educate todays population correctly. The central banks understand it, the Asian population understand it, and those on this platform most likely understand it unless your name is Major ;-)",

The lack of understanding on this fact is why the world is suffering a consistent lack of purchasing power with these notes, and hence we now need $5000 notes to buy that ounce of gold that only required $42 notes to buy that same ounce in 1971. The printing of new notes is now gaining speed as the debts spiral, and the realisation of the fact these notes have and will continue to lose purchasing power, that\u2019s why both silver and gold will increase in value, and the media still doesn\u2019t educate todays population correctly. The central banks understand it, the Asian population understand it, and those on this platform most likely understand it, it\u2019s not a gold bug theory, it\u2019s just fact.",

My own guess is that we will probably peak at somewhere in the $140 - $180 area, rather than where Michael Oliver sits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw78V5Er3XU At the moment I think (hope) that we will stay in a step consolidation phase for a few weeks (say $80 - $100) before moving into the next level $100 - $125, perhaps associated with a strong COMEX delivery. As for gold, it looks like it's setting up for a slow, steady (and healthy) recovery. I think $5,500 is pretty much baked in, but I don't think a peak of $6,000 is out of the question. Meanwhile MTL's share price is still languishing at 15p - 16p. With the wind of gold and silver in the right direction, and first gold expected in Q4 (I wouldn't be surprised with an August or September announcement), we could see a stellar November\\December; perhaps even a 30p share price as we close in on 2027 production.",

As for America, I acknowledge Trump's backing for what it's worth. He also promised to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of being elected, and issued ludicrous import taxes on any country that upset him. He has still failed to deliver on Ukraine and reversed or reduced many of the new import taxes.

In that case, there would not have been so much speculation and expectations. However, it will be interesting to see  how the employees at Runruno would react to the news that the plant will be moved out of the country totally and they will have no employment. If there is no progress after 3 months, then we will become a one trick pony with a high risk mine in Nic and I myself might decide to move some of my gains to other miners to reduce my exposure.

That is it's popularity is it's selling point more than anything else Also bitcoin or crypto will be competing against government backed digital currency. Imagine doing maths with divisible bitcoin. Also fiat currency has it's uses to government, that is inflation and deflationary measures and most of all people forget they want government or some orgs to be in power, because there is just that sense of security that other orga can't provide. That is we all want government in one form or another. Also BlackRock bitcoin holdings is basically 1% of entire port. If it goes to zero it just doesn't matter to them. They got in because of the liquidity opportunity. Also",

Go watch it back, he's way more bullish than he was today. Abra is a carbon copy of the issues at Dupax by the way and he was very quiet on that today.

There is also what like 20 million cryptos out there. Bitcoin itself when you look at it looks like a barcode but heavily marketed as a gold coin via images, to draw its analogy to gold. That is it's popularity is it's selling point more than anything else Also bitcoin or crypto will be competing against government backed digital currency. Imagine doing maths with divisible bitcoin. Also fiat currency has it's uses to government, that is inflation and deflationary measures and most of all people forget they want government or some orgs to be in power, because there is just that sense of security that other orga can't provide. That is we all want government in one form or another. Also BlackRock bitcoin holdings is basically 1% of entire port. If it goes to zero it just doesn't matter to them. They got in because of the liquidity opportunity. Also",

Go watch it back, he's way more bullish than he was today. Abra is a carbon copy of the issues at Dupax by the way and he was very quiet on that today.

Chilliboots has observed that we have seen a big change in the approach to Dupax. Initially we are told there will be a rolling release of drill results. Then everything goes quiet although we get a photo of some drill cores. Corporate presentations barely mention Dupax and the drill results never come.  Some talk about monsoon damage and now it\u2019s all about a recalcitrant community who are known to be politically motivated. We never did get the drill results.

I'm guessing that he's deliberately playing down Dupax since I suspect the impediment is not the stuff in the ground but the grouchy locals.  Interesting point he made about the politics.  Sounds like the local power centre is sympathetic to the previous regime - Duterte - which was China friendly.  Given politics over there tends to be buggins turn there is every possibility that the China huggers come back to power in Manilla and the Chinese will come round sniffing for good opportunities. Keeping Dupax's potential understated might put them off.  Otherwise the resource could be whipped out from under their noses.",

It signifies that he believes Bitcoin is not just dangerous or useless (\"rat poison\") but exceptionally so (\"squared\"), viewing it as a speculative, non-productive bubble that will likely end in disaster. It's a classic pyramid scheme that can only continue if another fool pays more than the last fool for it. Remember BTC is not a physical thing that has utility, it exists as a bunch of electrons on a network of computers. Almost nobody accepts BTC as a currency of trade. If I had some, where could I spend them? Something that can fluctuate +/- as much as 10% or more in a day is not an investment, it's simply a gamble. For those that own it, I wish you luck.

In his view AI could raise productivity and not trigger inflation. Whilst AI could raise productivity perhaps in certain sectors. Coding, health diagnosis and autonomous robots. It has to be noted that there will also be creation of new jobs, like prompt technician and quality control AI. Perhaps it might rejig the workers, I don't see how this could raise more income to the gov to pay off us interest repayment. Also, EU seems to have sped up the India trade deal, which is a major good news for Russia, even though EU says they need to exclude Russian crude, whilst russian crude probably will be used for domestic and others exported to EU at a higher price. It also has to be noted Modi and Putin was hugging each other just a month before. And us actually raised tariff on India because of imported crude from Russia. Whilst China gets shafted with human rights stuff, India on the other hand is pretty much oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. Perhaps EU could agree on it. Just my macro view, but geopolitical tension is shifting but unsure of stability.",

Whatever your motivation, it\u2019s worth taking the time to research, reflect, and build a strategy that fits your own goals rather than reacting to noise or emotion. Weekhands and short-termism make for skittish investing.  After all, knee\u2011jerk reactions tend to be made by people acting like jerks. I'm backing the current management of MTL to make the right calls. Keep your powder dry and buy on the dips.",

So I'm with Lee on this one, 1p rise on each monthly update and then a bigger re-rating when first pour is announced",

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before.

Thanks to PoG my other mining stocks have helped drive my SIPP through \u00a32m. It's taken 35 years to get here for me from when I was 21.

Accordingly, we are considering other options to repurpose the Runruno plant and will keep shareholders updated with any developments\u201d.

Bloody handy for Metals investors to have bought Condor :) Imagine the scene if everything was riding on Dupax. At same time Condor shareholders can thank their socks the friggin mine is getting built at Arguably best time in last 20 years. Also hope Metals drops an RNS about some way forward as otherwise 1000s of staff will be staring at a P45 end of the year and i am sure government and community will do something to keep mine operating. Lot more pressure for Darren that i think be quite enjoys but Dupax should come together.",

Current mine has 4-5 years left at 90k oz pa waiting on update to see if this can be extended another 5 years, 2nd mine PFS shows 12 year LOM @ 90oz Pa, 3rd mine early stage speculation potentially another 10yr + LOM @90k oz pour 2031 - so it is very comparable to MTL.

My worry started when IG removed all trading fees, now they have removed annual fees, and also pay interest on any balance not invested, so how do they make money? They sound more like a bank than a broker, as in my funds are not actually in their hands, and being used elsewhere making a higher interest for them, I moved to HL because they charge for trades, and now have annual fees, sounds more like a broker which I like, when something is free, like IG I get suspicious. Thoughts welcome.",

The Government has been pushing for years to abolish all paper shares. The shares are harder to trade and more expensive to do so in paper form, which could cause a problem if you needed to sell quickly. As you said, your broker will not wish to assist you as you would be taking the shares out of your account with them. Another issue is if your shares are held in an ISA. They would need to come out of the ISA and you would lose their Capital Gains immunity whenever you sell any of them. I would also like to hold my shares in my name, but paper certificates is not the way. It was previously possible to do this by holding your shares in  a personal CREST account. This was considerably more expensive than a broker nominee account, but nobody seems to offer this service any more.",

I suspect in light of gold price it will be economic to mine material at lower grades of gold in the current pit. $5300 changes a lot of dynamics and i am sure Runruno can run on $2500 AISC very nicely at these levels.

He was winding uo Runruno to tie in with Dupax but with Dupax delayed etc he will probably work over some areas and probably relook at Mallibeg South etc. we have lots of cashflow so we have lots of ways it can be deployed if need be. I sti think  Dupax will work out as their original sampling and trenching was strong and a shame they dont specify how much drilling they have done as not aware it was much.",

There will be a major upheaval at Runruno with many disappointed workers and loss of a community that has taken years to build. Darren's Philippine family life may also be affected unless he finds something in the country to follow up on other than Abra. There will also be additional costs in closing down Runruno. Whilst it appears Darren is looking at options which take up his and other management time, MTL with La India production only 9 months away, has become a potential opportunity for a cash-rich mid-tier miner.

The treasury shares that cost him \u00a325 million are also piggy bank savings worth multiples of that investment, and can be put into play to help finance a new shovel ready mine, the hints were made in the Crux video and the drop of Dupax completely for now is another clue, the next Condor style acquisition will be just as out of the blue as Condor, an RNS stating interest will actually be a done deal in the back ground, and as we can see how quick we have built La India, Runruno 2 will follow 18 months later. Other mines based on how the shareprice moves today is not a reason to let this amazing and masterful company slip from your fingers, be patient as the best is coming, and clarity for Runruno is just a few months away.",

The MTL one is good as well, but has a bit more risk currently imo. I view the complete ignoring of Dupax by DB as understandable, what else could DB do. It's dead for the moment. Company execs are, apparently, even banned from some regions in the Philippines, and the authorities are investigating how Woggle got the exploration license. That doesn't sound like news to drive up the SP, and may be why there is some red on the SP today. On the Crux article  however this comment sticks out for MTL \"Favorable Valuation Entry: Current market cap ~\u00a3400M for company delivering 140,000 oz annually with exploration upside and near-term M&A catalyst\" OK the 140k is next year or maybe the year after (MTL forecast 126k for 2027 in the Nov25 presentation), but MTL is certainly something to consider later this year, when things settle and outlook is more clearer. I see myself switching back in, if conditions allow.",

He did let slip a line - i can't recall it verbatim - about another project. I think we could potentially be further down the road with something else than you might realise.

Having been with MTL since the beginning I feel some loyalty to the company whereby, unlike you, my heart may be ruling my head. Having said that I did last week sell a small part of my holding to put money into both Kefi and HEX, two companies that should do well in the next few months, hopefully longer.  GLA",

When i looked at it i felt upside was largely priced in because in 2027 Serabi is still a 55k ounze producer with AISC of $1800, whereas Metals is set up for a 2027 production of 140k ounzes with something like $1200 aisc. Serabi is still a single juristiction play and given market cap of both is not a million miles away i just could not see the attraction compared to Metals in terms of upside this year. Serabi could be seen as maybe safer option but its more tied to gold price than Metals that will revalue over the next 8 months. Biggest upside to Serabi is rising gold price and its Coringa permit but a lot of that is priced in as well. I also fancy something good happening in Philipines after Lee observation and family ties. Nothing wrong with spreading risk though but Metals should comfortably outperform Serabi purely on numbers, assuming la India goes live on or before prediction.",

With this move I have minimised all these recent MTL hits and indeed am up 15% since I switched, all SRB movement. I appreciate markets are volatile and all this can reverse. MTL is a good story for 2027, however it is a one mine producer currently, with an uncertain future in Philippines. I have to recognise I made a mistake back in July 2025, when I invested in MTL instead of SRB. The last straw was when the recently the MTL SP went below my July 25 buy price, even with PoG being sky high. SRB had fallen as well and I considered that a better buying opportunity/less risky investment to grow. I still think the story of MTL is generally good, but has soured recently, and there are better choices out there, with less geo political risk. I hope Nic doesn't come into the USA sights with China building an airport there, as La India is the only story in town with MTL at the moment. I am still holding some MTL in my F&S for now, so I may still post on this BB every so often, especially if I step in big time again. :) For all you LTH I wish you every success and hope you realise your plans.

I imagine there are similar projects to what we purchased from Condor, more advanced and shovel ready than Dupax, which was a low cost proposition had it worked, but moving the processing plant in country is a lot easier and many of his staff at Runruno may follow the work and move with the project. I have a feeling the drop of Dupax being so final and the update mentioning a H1 target the talks in the background are all ready in progress with the other party, plus the $30 million loan reserve may be part of that thinking, a means to pay for it now, Runruno 2 here we come IMHO",

Nic has it's own issues, but they are far more open to mining investment. Acquiring another project in another jurisdiction would be very useful to manage the risk of having all our eggs in one basket, no matter how good that basket may appear to be. But there are only so many projects like La India globally, and they will all be substantially more expensive than CNR was, now that the gold price has taken off, and pulled the whole sector along with it. Interesting times. I'm holding, but with a little less conviction than before. La India is the golden goose for sure and sentimentally, I've gotta see production happening there, having waited all this time!

Looks like the mine plan is underground then ends with an open pit according to the JORC report. However from the JORC report the mine plan suggests only 800ktonnes pa of material. This is a lot less than what Runruno plant can handle. Unless they can amend the plan or add more resources into the plan it doesn't look big enough.",

Payments due under the CVR, will be settled by way of the issue of either New MTL Shares or unsecured Loan Notes, or a combination thereof, at MTL's sole election, following the third and fifth anniversary of the CVR Commencement Date. \u00b7 Accordingly, the maximum potential CVR Consideration payable pursuant to the Offer, as detailed further below, amounts to US$28.8 million (approximately \u00a322.6 million at the Exchange Rate), representing 11.1p per Condor Gold Share (the \"Maximum CVR Consideration\"). Accordingly, the Fixed Consideration and the Maximum CVR Consideration (at the Exchange Rate), in aggregate, could amount to up to approximately \u00a390.1 million, representing approximately 44.1p per Condor Gold Share (the \"Maximum Potential Consideration\").

Looks like the mine plan is underground then ends with an open pit according to the JORC report. However from the JORC report the mine plan suggests only 800ktonnes pa of material. This is a lot less than what Runruno plant can handle. Unless they can amend the plan or add more resources into the plan it doesn't look big enough.",

G7 central banks don\u2019t buy gold - that\u2019s 25% of global GDP - other central bank purchases slowed last year (not stoped as I previously posted) the rise above $5k is driven by retail and ETF flows - it may well go higher but as we have seen this rise will be be volatile. Silver is heavily manipulated, it always has been, and can\u2019t be trusted. Gold has its uses as an asset  and has partially replaced Treasuries but it can\u2019t fully replace it . The price of gold is not the most important factor in MTLs share price - derisking and reducing the risk discount to increase the PE ratio could give us an exponential increase not the linear increase we get from a rising gold price!",

When the power supplies or internet are destroyed, you can\u2019t use bitcoin, look at Ukraine as an example, they have neither in many parts of the country, they will be bartering with valuables or ever shrinking paper notes, how long do we expect the internet to function in a major war, the fibre optics in the seas would be the first to go, then the powerstations, imagine what happens to bitcoins price then?

G7 central banks don\u2019t buy gold - that\u2019s 25% of global GDP - other central bank purchases slowed last year (not stoped as I previously posted) the rise above $5k is driven by retail and ETF flows - it may well go higher but as we have seen this rise will be be volatile. Silver is heavily manipulated, it always has been, and can\u2019t be trusted. Gold has its uses as an asset  and has partially replaced Treasuries but it can\u2019t fully replace it . The price of gold is not the most important factor in MTLs share price - derisking and reducing the risk discount to increase the PE ratio could give us an exponential increase not the linear increase we get from a rising gold price!",

The government do have bitcoin and all that was from seizure from people who didn't follow the said laws of the country, so buying it doesn't really make too much sense to the government. Blockchain is practicable in some use cases but the value of the byproduct (crypto) to be traded is not necessary. Microstrategy I imagine will head to bankruptcy, because they are basically using leverage to buy bitcoin and their fundamental ib business does not make money.",

I know this sounds mad max but when you have wars which would you prefer to be using? A computer based system or a piece of gold? When the power supplies or internet are destroyed, you can\u2019t use bitcoin, look at Ukraine as an example, they have neither in many parts of the country, they will be bartering with valuables or ever shrinking paper notes, how long do we expect the internet to function in a major war, the fibre optics in the seas would be the first to go, then the powerstations, imagine what happens to bitcoins price then? Imagine how high gold goes then? I hope we never see such things, but physical assets will be the only wealth preserver.",

The only way gvnts can control de centralised Bitcoin is to buy it. What do we think happens then? Tokenisation is happening and it is blockchain that enables it.

Compare their graph over 20 years to gold! The internet was laughed now it is a part of daily life. Currently I am more bullish on gold than crypto but that will change.

My own guess is that we will probably peak at somewhere in the $140 - $180 area, rather than where Michael Oliver sits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw78V5Er3XU At the moment I think (hope) that we will stay in a step consolidation phase for a few weeks (say $80 - $100) before moving into the next level $100 - $125, perhaps associated with a strong COMEX delivery. As for gold, it looks like it's setting up for a slow, steady (and healthy) recovery. I think $5,500 is pretty much baked in, but I don't think a peak of $6,000 is out of the question. Meanwhile MTL's share price is still languishing at 15p - 16p. With the wind of gold and silver in the right direction, and first gold expected in Q4 (I wouldn't be surprised with an August or September announcement), we could see a stellar November\\December; perhaps even a 30p share price as we close in on 2027 production.",

As for America, I acknowledge Trump's backing for what it's worth. He also promised to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of being elected, and issued ludicrous import taxes on any country that upset him. He has still failed to deliver on Ukraine and reversed or reduced many of the new import taxes. Trump unfortunately suffers from a God complex; he thinks that he only has to say something for it to become true.",

In that case, there would not have been so much speculation and expectations. However, it will be interesting to see  how the employees at Runruno would react to the news that the plant will be moved out of the country totally and they will have no employment. If there is no progress after 3 months, then we will become a one trick pony with a high risk mine in Nic and I myself might decide to move some of my gains to other miners to reduce my exposure.

Go watch it back, he's way more bullish than he was today. Abra is a carbon copy of the issues at Dupax by the way and he was very quiet on that today. Thank god for La India and lets see if he can work some magic on the acquisition for the Runruno plant, dare I say we're owed it after the Dupax let down.",

Whilst I think this was unfortunate, this is something regulators themselves need to confront. Because they are handing out permits to miners without communication with the regional governors.

Go watch it back, he's way more bullish than he was today. Abra is a carbon copy of the issues at Dupax by the way and he was very quiet on that today. Thank god for La India and lets see if he can work some magic on the acquisition for the Runruno plant, dare I say we're owed it after the Dupax let down.",

Chilliboots has observed that we have seen a big change in the approach to Dupax. Initially we are told there will be a rolling release of drill results. Then everything goes quiet although we get a photo of some drill cores. Corporate presentations barely mention Dupax and the drill results never come.  Some talk about monsoon damage and now it\u2019s all about a recalcitrant community who are known to be politically motivated. We never did get the drill results.

I'm guessing that he's deliberately playing down Dupax since I suspect the impediment is not the stuff in the ground but the grouchy locals.  Interesting point he made about the politics.  Sounds like the local power centre is sympathetic to the previous regime - Duterte - which was China friendly.  Given politics over there tends to be buggins turn there is every possibility that the China huggers come back to power in Manilla and the Chinese will come round sniffing for good opportunities. Keeping Dupax's potential understated might put them off.  Otherwise the resource could be whipped out from under their noses.",

It's a classic pyramid scheme that can only continue if another fool pays more than the last fool for it. Remember BTC is not a physical thing that has utility, it exists as a bunch of electrons on a network of computers. Almost nobody accepts BTC as a currency of trade. If I had some, where could I spend them? Something that can fluctuate +/- as much as 10% or more in a day is not an investment, it's simply a gamble. For those that own it, I wish you luck.

In his view AI could raise productivity and not trigger inflation. Whilst AI could raise productivity perhaps in certain sectors. Coding, health diagnosis and autonomous robots. It has to be noted that there will also be creation of new jobs, like prompt technician and quality control AI. Perhaps it might rejig the workers, I don't see how this could raise more income to the gov to pay off us interest repayment. Also, EU seems to have sped up the India trade deal, which is a major good news for Russia, even though EU says they need to exclude Russian crude, whilst russian crude probably will be used for domestic and others exported to EU at a higher price. It also has to be noted Modi and Putin was hugging each other just a month before. And us actually raised tariff on India because of imported crude from Russia. Whilst China gets shafted with human rights stuff, India on the other hand is pretty much oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. Perhaps EU could agree on it. Just my macro view, but geopolitical tension is shifting but unsure of stability.",

Do the maths. People invest for all sorts of reasons. Some focus on the short term, others take the long view. Some chase capital growth, while others prefer the steady comfort of dividends. Whatever your motivation, it\u2019s worth taking the time to research, reflect, and build a strategy that fits your own goals rather than reacting to noise or emotion. Weekhands and short-termism make for skittish investing.  After all, knee\u2011jerk reactions tend to be made by people acting like jerks.

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

However, a spate of bad news from end of September 25 slowed down the momentum and we did drift between 12p and 14p. This is what I meant. When the momentum fades due to lack of progress/news, we get traded like a penny share.

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

That being said, Dupax wasn't even on the table several months ago, and with progress at la india moving i was content. I'm growing impatient watching other producers steam ahead with the accelerating gold price. Condor Luck wpuld have it that it'll fall back on it's haunches right in time for our first pour and the selloff will be over egged, simply because we're that type of share! The reality is that the maths is just absolutely unreal. I hate the idea of wishing away time - life's short - but I'd really.love for us to be at the point of pouring and making a killing right now. I feel like until the goods receipts are in, the market won't recognise how profitable this company is. If something happens in the Philippines in the mean time then fine. But as many of you have pointed out - a lot of pain for little upside at this point. Metals is lucky to have another jurisdiction to fall back on and one that'll appreciate the jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue from our pan-handling. If Philippines doesn't want it for legitimate socioeconomic reasons, that's their call. An economic loss for sure, but their call all the same. Might just go back to bed for a year!",

Delays which DB's pace of getting things done ahead of schedule is probably still going to fall in line with the normal timeline. The interview will be great to answer other questions, but having kept the faith from the 1p range, we are in such better ground compared to before. Even the BIOX contamination has ended up generating income as the delay in processing has meant the price of gold increased 25% in the interim.

WHICH MEANS, STILL MORE DRILLING TO DO @ DUPAX..!!! DB says the following:- \u201cDrilling at Dupax to date has indicated that the target ore zone is deeper than predicted. As a result, we have concluded that an economic resource at Dupax will not be able to be defined in time for Runruno's ore processing operations to be extended via the processing of Dupax ore. Accordingly, we are considering other options to repurpose the Runruno plant and will keep shareholders updated with any developments\u201d. WHICH MEANS, DUE TO DELAYS, DUPAX WILL NOT BE READY IN TIME TO FEED ORE INTO  RUNRUNO MILL. THEREFORE DB IS LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS FOR RUNRUNO MILL IN THE INTERIM PERIOD.",

Bloody handy for Metals investors to have bought Condor :) Imagine the scene if everything was riding on Dupax. At same time Condor shareholders can thank their socks the friggin mine is getting built at Arguably best time in last 20 years. Also hope Metals drops an RNS about some way forward as otherwise 1000s of staff will be staring at a P45 end of the year and i am sure government and community will do something to keep mine operating. Lot more pressure for Darren that i think be quite enjoys but Dupax should come together.",

Current mine has 4-5 years left at 90k oz pa waiting on update to see if this can be extended another 5 years, 2nd mine PFS shows 12 year LOM @ 90oz Pa, 3rd mine early stage speculation potentially another 10yr + LOM @90k oz pour 2031 - so it is very comparable to MTL.

My worry started when IG removed all trading fees, now they have removed annual fees, and also pay interest on any balance not invested, so how do they make money? They sound more like a bank than a broker, as in my funds are not actually in their hands, and being used elsewhere making a higher interest for them, I moved to HL because they charge for trades, and now have annual fees, sounds more like a broker which I like, when something is free, like IG I get suspicious. Thoughts welcome.",

As you said, your broker will not wish to assist you as you would be taking the shares out of your account with them. Another issue is if your shares are held in an ISA. They would need to come out of the ISA and you would lose their Capital Gains immunity whenever you sell any of them. I would also like to hold my shares in my name, but paper certificates is not the way. It was previously possible to do this by holding your shares in  a personal CREST account.

I suspect in light of gold price it will be economic to mine material at lower grades of gold in the current pit. $5300 changes a lot of dynamics and i am sure Runruno can run on $2500 AISC very nicely at these levels.
