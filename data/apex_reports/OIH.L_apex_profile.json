The indirect method has been selected to present the cash flows statement.\n2.2 Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRSs\")\n2.2.1 New currently effective requirements\nEffective date\nNew standards or amendments\nJanuary 1, 2024\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nNon-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nSupplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nLease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nIn the current year, the group has applied a number of amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards that are effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2023.

These policies have been applied consistently by the Group entities.\n\u00a7\nBasis of consolidation\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control.\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and the financial statements of those entities over which the Company has control, both directly and indirectly, from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date such control ceases.\nThe financial statements used in the consolidation process are those prepared by the individual Group entities in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)\n\u00a7\nConsolidation procedures used are as follows:\n-\nThe assets and liabilities and income and expenses of subsidiaries are included on a line-by-line basis, allocating to non-controlling interests, where applicable, the share of equity and profit or loss for the year that is attributable to them.\n-\nThe resulting balances are presented separately in equity and the consolidated income statement; the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations.\n-\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Group.\n-\nThe consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n-\nAny contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured, and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in consolidated profit or loss.\n-\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the interest acquired in the net fair value at the acquisition date of the assets and liabilities of the entity or business acquired. Goodwill relating to investments accounted for using the equity method is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair values of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in the consolidated profit or loss.\n-\nAcquisition costs on business combinations are expensed as incurred, except if they relate to issue debt or equity securities.\n-\nThe purchase of equity holdings from non-controlling holders are accounted for as equity transactions that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration received and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.\n-\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\u00a7\nInterests in equity-accounted investees\nThe Group's interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates and a joint venture\n.\n- Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n-\nInterests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognized at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\nThe equity method is as follows:\n-\nThe Group's share of the profit or loss of an investee is recognized in the consolidated profit or loss from the date when significant influence begins up to the date when that significant influence ceases or when the investment is classified as held for sale. Investments in associates with negative shareholders' equity are recorded till the Group's interest is reduced to zero and a provision for its losses is accrued only if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses.\n-\nThe Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and it's carrying value.\n-\nIf the ownership interest in an associate is reduced, but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in the consolidated other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated profit or loss.\n-\nUnrealized gains and losses generated from transactions between the Company, or its subsidiaries and its investees accounted for using the equity method are eliminated on consolidation for the portion pertaining to the Group; unrealized losses are eliminated unless they represent impairment.\n-\nManagement fees received from associates are included within revenue.\nAppendix A includes a list of the entities included in the scope of consolidation.\n\u00a7\nNon-controlling interests\nNon-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group's equity\" therein\".\nNon-controlling interests that represent current equity interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the net assets of the entity in liquidation, they may be measured at initial recognition either at fair value or in the Proportionate share of the non-controlling interests in the recognized values of the net assets acquired - The Measurement basis for each acquisition transaction is selected separately.\nThe non-controlling interest in an acquire is initially measured at the non-controlling interest proportionate share in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent consideration recognized on acquisition date.\n\u00a7\nForeign currency translation\nFunctional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The functional currency of the Company is Egyptian pound. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in 'US Dollars' (US$), which is the Group's presentation currency. The numbers disclosed according to the presentation currency \"US$\" represent the translation of the group financial results recognized in its functional currency \"EGP \"converted to US$ using the appropriate exchange rates\nTransactions and balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the relevant entity at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated, at the reporting date, into the prevailing exchange rates at that date. Foreign currency exchange differences arising on the settlement of transactions and the translation of the statement of financial position are recognized in the income statement. Gains and losses on long-term financing provided to Group subsidiaries by the parent company, for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur, are initially recognized in. other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income statement on disposal of the relevant entity, transaction in foreign currency for non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at historical cost are initially recorded using closing rate at the date of the transaction while items carried at fair value should be reported at the rate that existed when fair values were determined.\nIf a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in other comprehensive income, any foreign exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognized in other comprehensive income.\nGroup companies\nThe financial statements of the Group entities are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\u00b7\nAssets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\u00b7\nIncome and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.\n\u00b7\nAll resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component of equity in the \"translation reserve\" until the group loses control of the relevant subsidiary. When the group disposes of a foreign operation the translation reserve, previously recognized in equity, is transferred to the income statement.\n\u00b7\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate; and\n\u00b7\nIn the preparation of the consolidated cash flow statement, the cash flows of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate for the year, except for the opening and closing cash balances.\nThe exchange rates applied in relation to the US$ are as follows:\nAverage for the\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nClosing rate as of\nDecember 31, 2024\nAverage for the\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nClosing rate as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nEgyptian Pound (EGP)\n0.0220\n0.0196\n0.0326\n0.0324\nEuro (EUR)\n1.0817\n1.0353\n1.0815\n1.1038\nBrazilian Real (BRL)\n0.1854\n0.1620\n0.2003\n0.2061\nLBP Lebanese Pounds (LBP)\n0.00001\n0.00001\n0.00007\n0.00007\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at purchase cost or production cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for use and any dismantling and removal costs which may be incurred because of contractual obligations, which require the asset to be returned to its original state and condition.\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Each asset is treated separately if it has an autonomously determinable useful life and value. Depreciation is charged at rates calculated to write off the costs over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis from the date the asset is available and ready for use.\nThe useful lives of property and equipment and their residual values are reviewed and updated, where necessary, at least at each year-end. Land is not depreciated. When a depreciable asset is composed of identifiable separate components whose useful lives vary significantly from those of other components of the asset, depreciation is calculated for each component separately, applying the \"component approach\".\nThe useful lives estimated by the Group for the various categories of property and equipment are as follows.\nNumber of years\nBuildings\n50\nLeasehold improvements and renovations\n3-8\nMachinery\n5-10\nComputer equipment\n3-5\nFurniture and fixtures\n5-10\nVehicles\n3-6\nGains or (losses) arising from the sale or retirement of assets are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the asset sold or retired and are recognized in the income statement in the period incurred.\nLeases\nWith the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use. Each lease payment is allocated between the principal liability and finance costs. Finance costs are charged to the income statement over the lease period using the effective interest rate method.\nAs A leasee , right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; (iii) any initial direct costs and, if applicable, (iv) restoration costs. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis.\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of the following: (i) fixed lease payments, (ii) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate and, if applicable, (iii) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, and (iv) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option. Lease liabilities do not include any non-lease components that may be included in the related contracts.\nLease payments are subsequently measured at amortized cost and discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the entire term of the contract, unless the contract provides for the transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or the cost of the lease reflects the fact that the lessee will exercise the purchase option. In this case, the depreciation must be the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the duration of the contract. The estimated useful lives for right-of-use assets are calculated according to the same criterion applied to owned tangible assets. In addition, the right-of-use asset is decreased by any impairment losses and adjusted to reflect any remeasurement of the associated lease liability.\nIn the statement of financial position, the Group presents right-of-use assets within property and equipment and lease liabilities within current and non-current borrowings.\nIn the income statement, interest expense on lease liabilities constitutes a component of financial expenses and is shown separately from the depreciation of right-of-use assets.\nSale and leaseback\nAn entity (the seller-lessee) transfers an asset to another entity (the buyer-lessor) and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor, both the seller-lessee and the buyer-lessor shall account for the transfer contract and the lease.\nAssessing whether the transfer of the asset is a sale\nAn entity shall apply the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset.\nTransfer of the asset is a sale.\nIf the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset:\nThe seller-lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, the seller-lessee shall recognise only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.\nIf the fair value of the consideration for the sale of an asset does not equal the fair value of the asset, or if the payments for the lease are not at market rates, an entity shall make the following adjustments to measure the sale proceeds at fair value:\n\u00b7\nAny below-market terms shall be accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments; and\n\u00b7\nAny above-market terms shall be accounted for as additional financing provided by the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee.\nTransfer of the asset is not a sale :\nIf the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee does not satisfy the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the seller-lessee shall continue to recognise the transferred asset and shall recognise a financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds. It shall account for the financial liability applying IFRS 9.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life - for example, goodwill- are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. In determining an asset's value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects the market's current assessment of the cost of money for the investment period and the specific risk profile of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units, \"CGU\"). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognized immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.\nInvestment property\nInvestment properties are property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held by the Group to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are initially measured at cost. The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure.\nDirectly attributable expenditure includes, for example, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group has elected to measure investment properties at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\nInvestment property is derecognized upon disposal, when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits expected from its disposal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of investment property are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated profit or loss in the period of the retirement or disposal. Reclassifications to / from investment property are made when, and only when, there is a change of use.\nRevenue from operating lease rentals is recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant term of the lease. The rental income generated by investment properties is recognized within revenues in the consolidated income statement.\nDepreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of the investment properties. The estimated useful lives of leased units are estimated at 50 years.\nFinancial assets\n\u00a7\nRecognition and measurement\nTrade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\u00a7\nClassification and Subsequent Measurement\nThe Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories:\n\u00b7\nAmortized cost\n\u00b7\nFVOCI - debt investment\n\u00b7\nFVOCI - equity investment or\n\u00b7\nFVTPL.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\u00b7\nIt is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\u00b7\nIts contractual terms give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:\n\u00b7\nIt is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n\u00b7\nIts contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\u00a7\nFinancial assets - Business model assessment\nThe Group assesses the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:\n\u00b7\nThe stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities, or expected cash outflows or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets.\n\u00b7\nHow the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management.\n\u00b7\nthe risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed.\n\u00b7\nHow managers of the business are compensated - e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n\u00b7\nThe frequency, volume, and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.\nFinancial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.\n\u00a7\nAssessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\u00b7\nContingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows.\n\u00b7\nterms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable-rate features.\n\u00b7\nprepayment and extension features; and\n\u00b7\nterms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non-recourse features).\n\u00a7\nFinancial assets - Subsequent measurement and gains and losses\nFinancial assets at FVTPL\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\nFinancial assets at amortized cost\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairments losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\n\u00a7\nFinancial liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.\n\u00a7\nDerecognition\nFinancial assets are derecognized when one of the following conditions is met:\n\u00b7\nThe contractual right to receive the cash flows from the asset has expired.\n\u00b7\nThe Group has substantially transferred all of the risks and rewards related to the asset, transferring its rights to receive the cash flows from the asset or assuming a contractual obligation to pass the cash flows received to one or more beneficiaries by virtue of an agreement that meets the requirements set out in IFRS 9 (pass through test)\n\u00b7\nThe Group has not transferred nor substantially maintained all the risks and rewards related to the financial asset but has transferred control.\n\u00a7\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (\"ECL\") on\n:\n-\nTrade receivables related to fees and commission under the scope of IFRS 15 (\"Revenues from Contracts with Customers\")\n- Financial assets measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI. The Group applies a simplified approach to measure some of these assets. For further information, please, refer to the section 3. Use of estimates and critical judgments- Impairment of financial assets.\nImpairment losses on financial assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under \"Impairment loss of other financial assets\".\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\nFor trade receivables related to fees and commission, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.\nFor financial assets measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. However, a lifetime ECLs is elected if the credit risk on the financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition.\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nand default\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\u00a7\nThere is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or the information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without considering any collateral held by the Group);\nor\n\u00a7\nThe financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate\nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).\nECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets are credit impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\u00b7\nSignificant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer.\n\u00b7\nA breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due.\n\u00b7\nThe restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise.\n\u00b7\nIt is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or another financial reorganization; or\n\u00b7\nThe disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nPresentation of allowance for ECL\nECL for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.\nFor financial instruments at FVOCI, the ECL is charged to consolidated profit or loss and is recognized in OCI.\nWrite-off\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. The Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due. Subsequent recoveries of an asset that was previously written off are recognized as a reversal of impairment in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the recovery occurs.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities consisting of borrowings, trade payables and other obligations are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the related contractual clauses and are initially recognized at fair value, adjusted by any directly attributable transaction costs.\nFinancial liabilities and trade payables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method\n\u00a7\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nThe financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, namely when the contractual obligation has been met, cancelled, or prescribed. An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different contractual terms, must be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the contractual terms of an existing financial liability must be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.\nFinance income and finance costs\nThe Group's finance income and finance costs include:\n\u00b7\nInterest income.\n\u00b7\nInterest expense.\n\u00b7\nDividend income.\n\u00b7\nNet gain or loss on financial assets at FVTPL.\n\u00b7\nForeign currency gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities; impairment losses (and reversals).\nInterest income or expense is recognised under the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.\nThe 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, or the amortised cost of the financial liability.\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit\u2011impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit\u2011impaired after initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit\u2011impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\nInterest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash-flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized using the original effective interest rate.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.\nThe group recognize loss allowances for ECL on the cash closing balance.\nT\nhe group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.\nCurrent and deferred income tax\nThe tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in equity.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred income tax is recognized, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the near future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\nProvisions\nProvisions are only recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events that will probably result in a future outflow of resources, and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The amount provided represents the best estimate of the present value of the outlay required to meet the obligation. The interest rate used in determining the present value of the liability reflects current market rates and considers the specific risk of each liability.\nEarnings per share\nBasic Earnings Per Share:\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company, both from continuing and discontinued operations, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share:\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of the Company outstanding during the year where, compared to basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares outstanding is modified to include the conversion of all dilutive potential shares, while the profit for the year is modified to include the effects of such conversion net of taxation. Diluted earnings per share are not calculated when there are losses as any dilutive effect would improve earnings per share.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nShort\u2011term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\nShare-based payment arrangements\nThe grant\u2011date fair value of equity\u2011settled share\u2011based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally known as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards.\nThe amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non\u2011market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non\u2011market performance conditions at the vesting date.\nFor share\u2011based payment awards with non\u2011vesting conditions, the grant\u2011date fair value of the share\u2011based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true\u2011up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\nThe fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of SARs, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at\neach reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value of the SARs. Any changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss.\nTermination benefits\nTermination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date, then they are discounted.\nBusiness Combination\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combination, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises:\n\u00b7\nFair values of the assets transferred.\n\u00b7\nLiabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business.\n\u00b7\nEquity interests issued by the group.\n\u00b7\nFair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and.\n\u00b7\nFair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe excess of the\n:\n\u00b7\nConsideration transferred.\n\u00b7\nAmount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and\n\u00b7\nAcquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity\nOver the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly on profit or loss as a bargain purchase.\nWhere the settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\nContingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated profit or loss.\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquire is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in the consolidated profit or loss.\nIn case that initial treatment of business combination is not complete at the end of financial period consolidated, the group recognizes temporary amounts for accounts and during the measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The adjustment is performed retrospectively for completion of new information (Intangible assets, deferred taxes/provisions, and others).\nSegment reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with the internal reporting information provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors of the Company.\nDiscontinued operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earliest of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nThe company recognizes revenue based on the following five steps:\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the contract with the client.\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the contractual obligation to transport goods and/or services (known as performance obligations).\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the price of the transaction.\n\u00b7\nAllocation of the transaction price to performance obligations determined based on the independent selling price for each good or service.\n\u00b7\nRecognition of income upon fulfilment of the relevant performance obligation.\nThe Group does not recognize any assets associated with the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer that are expected to be not recovered. The majority of revenue is recognized over a period of time and the Group applies the practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that would otherwise be recognized is one year or less.\nSpecifically, the Group mainly recognizes revenue from entertainment and Other trading activities.\nThe following is a statement of the group revenues and how to define each revenue\n:\nA.\nRevenue from Entertainment Segment\nRevenue from entertainment segment is predominantly generated by Orascom pyramids entertainment (\"OPE\") and Orascom sound and light \"OSL\" which includes Sound and light shows and entertainment activities and the pyramids site.\nA.1 Orascom pyramids entertainment (\"OPE\")\n\u00b7\nRental income: Rental income is recognized according to the accrual basis and in the straight-line manner according to the essence of the lease agreement.\n\u00b7\nSponsorship Revenue: Care income is recognized by the distribution of sponsorship consideration on a straight-line basis over the duration of the sponsorship contract.\n\u00b7\nEvents revenue: Events revenue is recognized when performing event for customers and no revenue is recognized in case of uncertainty of refund for this revenue or associated costs.\nA-2 Orascom sound and light \"OSL\n\u00b7\nRevenues of sound and light shows: - It is represented in the revenues resulting from sound light shows presented within the archaeological pyramids area.\nB.\nRevenue from investment property Segment\nRevenue from investment property is recognized according to the accrual basis and in the straight-line manner according to the rental contract duration.\nC.\nRevenue from other trading activities\nRevenue from other trading activities is predominantly generated by O-Trade and Blue EV recognized according to the accrual basis based on agreement and revenue recognition criteria.\nEBITDA Definition (Alternative performance measure)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA).\n\u00b7\nA management has presented the performance measure adjusted EBITDA because it monitors this performance measure at a consolidated level, and it believes that this measure is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting profit from continuing operations to exclude the impact of taxation, net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation, impairment losses/reversals related to goodwill, intangible assets, and other financial assets.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a defined performance measure in IFRS Accounting Standards. The Group's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities.\nRepurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)\nWhen shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.\n3. Use of estimates and critical judgements\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires that the directors apply accounting policies and methodologies that, in some circumstances, are based upon complex and subjective judgments and estimates that are based on historical experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable and realistic at the time, considering the relevant circumstances for example the assessment of control over subsidiaries and associates as well as the impairment of goodwill amount. The application of such estimates and assumptions affects the amounts recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and cash flows, as well as in the notes. Actual results might differ from such estimates due to the uncertainty surrounding the assumptions and conditions upon which estimates are based. The accounting estimates that require the more subjective judgment of management in making assumptions or estimates regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which changes in conditions may significantly affect the results reported in these Consolidated Financial Statements are summarised below.\nA.\nValuation of financial instruments - Note (17)\n-\n'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non\u2011performance risk.\n-\nA number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non\u2011financial assets and liabilities\n-\nWhen one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as 'active' if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis\n-\nIf there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction.\n-\nIf an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Group measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.\n-\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price - i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out.\nB.\nFair value hierarchy\nFor fair value measurement recognized in the statement of financial position, IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements based on a fair value hierarchy, with the following levels, by reference to the significance of the inputs used in making measurement:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for items identical to the asset being measured.\n\u00b7\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable.\n\u00b7\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are usually determined based on management's assumptions. However, Level 3 inputs must reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when determining an appropriate price for the asset.\nFair value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant that are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure.\nTherefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the funds the Group invest into have their own assumptions that are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed.\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by various funds in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nWhen determining fair value, the funds use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation techniques used by the funds to determine fair value are consistent with the market or income approaches. The market approach includes valuation techniques that use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities. The funds generally use the market approach to value exchange-traded securities.\nThe funds value equity securities that are traded on a national securities exchange at their last reported sales price. The funds generally value equity securities traded in the over the counter (OTC) markets and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date at their last reported bid price if held long, and last reported ask price if sold short. To the extent that equity securities are actively traded, and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments such as short-term trade receivables, trade payables, other receivables, and other payables, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value.\nC.\nImpairment of non-current assets\nNon-current assets are reviewed to determine whether there are any indications that the net carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and that they have suffered an impairment loss that needs to be recognized. In order to determine whether any such elements exist, it is necessary to make subjective measurements, based on information obtained within the Group, in the market and on past experience. When indicators are identified that an asset may have become impaired, the Group estimates the impairment loss using suitable valuation techniques. The identification of elements indicating that a potential impairment exists and estimates of the amount of the impairment, depend on factors that may vary in time, affecting management's assessments and estimates.\nD.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group applies a simplified approach to measure expected credit losses of trade receivables related to fees and commission and financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. In a simplified approach expected credit losses are measured on the basis of a lifetime or 12-month expected loss allowance. The expected credit losses are based on historical information on actual credit losses on receivables. The model considers other information on the future economic conditions available at the time of the measurement.\nE.\nDiscontinued operation\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations, and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:\n- Represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations.\n- Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or\n- Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held\u2011for\u2011sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and OCI is re\u2011presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\nF.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets constitute a significant part of the Group's total assets and the scheduled amortisation charges from a significant part of the annual operation expenses. The useful economic lives arrived at, on the basis of management's estimates and assumptions, have a major impact on the valuation of intangible assets.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the intangible asset is estimated, in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, intangible assets are allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\nG.\nSignificant influence in North Korea\nThe Company's investment in North Korea relates primarily to the 60% voting rights in the local telecom operator Koryolink. The accounting treatment has been modified during 2015 through recognizing it as an investment in associates instead of subsidiaries, as the OIH (Egypt) Group management believes in the existence of significant influence instead of control.\nIn the light of international sanctions that the United States administration has decided to impose on the North Korean government and its various departments, the OIH (Egypt) Group's management closely monitors ongoing activities to make sure that the sanctions are not violated, and the two sides reached some understanding of the organizational and commercial frameworks focused on organizing the work of telecommunications market in North Korea.\nThe accounting treatment has been modified during period ended September 30, 2015, though recognizing it as an investment in associates instead of investment in subsidiaries, as the Group management believes that the existence of significant influence instead of control\nThe accounting treatment has been modified during period ended September 30, 2015, though recognizing it as an investment in associates instead of investment in subsidiaries, as the Group's management believes that the existence of significant influence instead of control due to the increase of the restrictions, financial and operating difficulties facing Koryolink due to the international sanction imposed by the international community including the United States of America, the European Union, and the United Nations.\"\nThese sanctions have the effect of restricting financial transactions and the import and export of goods and services, including goods and services required to operate, maintain, and develop mobile networks. In addition, the restrictions implemented affect the ability of its associate to transfer profits to the parent (return of funds to its native).\nOn September 11, 2017, the United Nations Security Council issued a resolution obliging member state of the United Nations to pass laws prohibiting joint ventures and existing partnerships with the North Korean Republic unless approval is obtained to continue such joint ventures.\nThe Group's management submitted an official request through Ministry of the foreign affairs of the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to be excluded from adhering to the said resolution.\nOn December 26, 2018, the request to the Security Council Committee established to follow up the implementation of sanctions on North Korea was approved, with the exception of Koryolink, to ban foreign investment in North Korea and to allow Orascom Investment Holding to continue its activities in North Korea. And consider the company as a telecommunications infrastructure company offering a public service.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, Koryolink announced an increase in the company's capital by about 20 million euros, and KPTC, the shareholder of Koryolink by 25% at that time, subscribed to the entire shares of the capital increase, with Orascom Investment Holding refraining from subscribing to it. This increase led to a Dilution of Orascom Investment Holding's shareholding in Koryolink from 75% to 60%.\nShare capital\nEuro*\n%\nOrascom Investment Holding SAE\n60,000,000\n60%\nPost office Co.at North Korea\n40,000,000\n40%\nTotal\n100,000,000\n100%\n\\* The functional currency for Koryolink is Euro.\nH.\nDepreciation of non-current assets\nThe cost of property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis throughout the useful economic life of the relevant asset. The useful economic life is determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and is based upon historical experience for similar assets, market conditions, and forecasts regarding future events that could have an impact on useful life, including changes in technology. Therefore, the actual useful economic life may differ from the estimated useful life. The Group periodically evaluates sector and technology changes in order to update the remaining useful life. Such periodic updates could result in a change during the depreciation period, and therefore also in the depreciation in future periods.\nI.\nTaxes\nIncome taxes (both current income tax and deferred taxes) are determined in each country whereby the\nGroup operates in accordance with a prudent interpretation of the applicable tax regulations.\nThis process results in complex estimates in determining taxable and deductible income and taxable temporary differences between accounting and tax values. In particular, deferred tax assets are recognized when it is probable that there will be future taxable income against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, in relation to tax losses that can be used in future periods and deductible temporary differences, considers the estimated future taxable income on the basis of a prudent tax planning.\nJ.\nProvisions and contingent liabilities\nManagement assesses events and circumstances indicating that the Group may have an obligation resulting in the ordinary course of business, Management applies its judgment in determining whether the recognition criteria have been met through assessing the probability of the obligation, making assumptions about timing and amounts of future cash outflows expected to settle the obligation.\n4. Financial Risk Management\nFinancial risk factors\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. In particular, the Group is exposed to risks from movements in exchange rates, interest rates and market prices. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's performance through ongoing operational and finance activities. The management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework\n.\ni)\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure with acceptable parameters, while optimizing the returns.\nThe Group's strategy is aimed wherever possible at eliminating currency risk and managing derivatives in compliance with the policies and strategies defined within the Group, taking into consideration the different effects that these instruments could have on the profit or loss and the statement of financial position as a function of their classification and accounting treatment.\nii)\nForeign exchange risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising when its business transactions are in currencies other than its functional currency. The main currencies to which the Group is exposed are the US dollar (\"US$\"), the Euro (\"EUR\"), DPRK Won (\"KPW\") , Brazilian Real (\"BRL\") , Lebanese Pound( LBP) and the Egyptian Pound (\"EGP\").\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk arising in two separate ways:\na)\nForeign exchange operations risk\nThe Group entities predominantly execute their operating activities in their respective functional currencies. Some Group subsidiaries are, however, exposed to foreign currency risks in connection with scheduled payments in currencies that are not their functional currencies.\nIn general, this relates to foreign currency denominated supplier payables due to capital expenditures and receivables. The Group monitors the exposure to foreign currency risk on a group basis.\nManagement has set up a policy to require Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. In addition, the Group manages foreign currency risk by matching its principal cash outflows to the currency in which the principal cash inflows are denominated. This is generally achieved by obtaining loan financing in the relevant currency\nAt year end, major net assets / (net liabilities) foreign currencies positions presented in 'US Dollars' (US$), were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nin currency\n(Liabilities)\nin currency\nNet assets/(liabilities) in currency\nNet assets/(liabilities)\nin US$\nUS$\n101,083\n(2,780)\n98,303\n98,303\nLBP\n76,064,187\n(42,202,771)\n33,861,416\n2,257\nEuro\n84,052\n(65,713)\n18,339\n20,242\nGBP\n1\n--\n1\n2\nBRL\n11,310\n(1,781)\n9,529\n1,964\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets\nin currency\n(Liabilities)\nin currency\nNet assets/(liabilities) in currency\nNet assets/(liabilities)\nin US$\nUS$\n81,537\n1,397\n80,141\n80,141\nLBP\n645,116,211\n- 110,603,558\n755,719,769\n5,971\nEuro\n110,043\n87,413\n22,630\n23,429\nGBP\n108\n-\n108\n2\nBRL\n8,149\n2,012\n6,137\n994\nb)\nAs of December 31, 2024, if the functional currencies had increased/(decreased) by 10% against the US$, Euro, BRL, and GBP with all other variables held constant, the translation of foreign currency would have resulted in an increase / (decrease) of US$ $ 7,539 thousand and LBP 493 and Euro of 16,895 as well as BRL 136 of net profit\n(2023: US$ $ (8,981) thousand and Euro of (349) and LBP 226 as well as BRL 7,565 of net profit.\nc)\nForeign exchange translation risk\nDue to its international presence, the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, as these affect the translation of subsidiaries' assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the US$ (the Group's presentational currency). The currencies concerned are mainly the Egyptian pound, and the Euro. This represents a translational risk rather than a financial risk given that these movements are posted directly to equity in the cumulative translation reserve\niii)\nPrice risk\nThe Group has no exposure to equity instruments of other entities that are publicly traded.\niv)\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nThe Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings received at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.\nAll borrowings from banks outstanding as of December 31, 2024, US$ 17,391thousand (December 31, 2023 US$ 32,490 thousand) note 23 are at a fixed interest rate, at a variable interest rate and interest rate free.\nThe Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. The Group calculates the impact on the consolidated profit or loss of a defined interest rate shift. The same interest rate shift is used for all currencies.\nThe impact of a 1% interest rate shift would be a maximum increase/decrease in 2024 finance costs of US$ 0.251 million.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the maximum credit exposure.\nImpairment losses on financial assets and contract assets recognized in profit or loss were as follow: -\n(In thousands of US$)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nImpairment loss on trade receivables (note 19)\n(43)\n(3,963)\nImpairment loss on other assets (note\n20\n)\n--\n(52)\nImpairment loss of other financial assets (note 17)\n(13,065)\n(45,019)\nImpairment loss in cash and cash equivalent (\nnote 21)\n(892)\n(414)\nTotal\n(14,000)\n(49,448)\n\u00b7\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Group Companies have placed funds with the following financial institutions based on their credit rating: -\nRating\nName of Bank\n2024\n2023\nArab Bank Zurich\nBB\nBB\nCA Indosuez LU\nA+\nA+\nCredit Agricole Egypt\nA+\nA+\nQNB Bank\nBB-\nB-\nFAB Bank\nAA-\nAA-\nBank Masr\nB\nB-\nBanco General S. A\nBBB-\nBBB-\nAudi Bank\nCCC\nCCC\nThe Group held cash and cash equivalents of\nUS$\n45,714 million (2023:\nUS$\n73,583 million) with banks which are rated BB and A+ based on Standard & Poor and are considered to have low credit risk. The cash balances are measured on 12-month expected credit losses.\nThe Group held cash of US$ 1.2 million in a Lebanese bank as at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: US$ 0.552 million). Considering Lebanon's economic and financial crisis represented in hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and significant restrictions on foreign currency transfers, the Group assessed the recoverability of these cash balances and accordingly, The Group decided to fully impair the total cash balance.\nDuring August 2022, Koryolink decided, at the request of a shareholder in the company, to grant shareholders, without discrimination, a non-interest loan in accordance with the rules and procedures of local law, according to the percentage of its contribution to the company's capital. Accordingly, a cash amounting to US$ 86 million was transferred to the account of Orascom Investment Holding Company bank account in the Republic of Korea, knowing that all local regulations and laws regarding bank transfers and transactions will be applied to the mentioned amounts, and Orascom Investment Company will continue to comply with international sanctions resolutions in this regard.\nDuring December 2024, Koryolink Company granted all shareholders additional interest free loan amounted to EUR 30 million (equivalent to US$31 million as of 31 December 2024) transferred to Orascom investment holding bank account.\nOIH S.A.E. management performed ECL assessment on the cash received from Koryolink Loan and considered that there is 50% likelihood of recoverability due to the unpredictability of future developments, including potential changes in international sanctions, regulatory restrictions. Therefore, 50% ECL was recorded as at 31 December 2023 and December 2024.\n\u00b7\nTrade receivables\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. Details of concentration of revenue are included in notes 6.\nThe risk management committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group's review includes external ratings, if they are available, financial statements, credit agency information, industry information and in some cases bank references. Sale limits are established for each customer and reviewed quarterly. Any sales exceeding those limits require approval from the risk management committee.\nIn monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or a legal entity, whether they are a wholesale, retail or end-user customer, their geographic location, industry, trading history with the Group and existence of previous financial difficulties.\nThe Group is monitoring the economic environment in Brazil and is taking actions to limit its exposure to customers in countries experiencing particular economic volatility and discussion with government of Lebanon regarding releasing of the dues.\nThe Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.\nThe Group does not have trade receivable and contract assets for which no loss allowance is recognized because of collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the exposure to credit risk for trade receivables risk and contract assets by Geographic region was as follows:\n-\n(In thousands of US$)\nCarrying amount December 31, 2024\nCarrying amount December 31, 2023\nEgypt\n1,064\n2,009\nBrazil\n98\n685\nLebanon\n3,140\n2,514\nTotal\n4,302\n5,208\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by type of counterparty was as follows: -\n(In thousands of US$)\nCarrying amount December 31, 2024\nCarrying amount December 31, 2023\nEntertainment\n1,064\n2,009\nRentals\n98\n685\nGSM\n3,140\n2,514\nTotal\n4,302\n5,208\nvii)\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Group monitors and mitigates liquidity risk arising from the uncertainty of cash inflows and outflows by maintaining sufficient liquidity of cash balances. In general, liquidity risk is monitored at entity level whereby each subsidiary is responsible for managing and monitoring its cash flows and rolling liquidity reserve forecast in order to ensure that it has sufficient committed facilities to meet its liquidity needs.\nLaws and regulations in certain countries, such as North Korea, in which the Group operates limit the conversion of current cash balances into foreign currency. Given the nature of the business, Group companies may have to make payments in foreign currencies (for example capital expenditures), the lack of individual entity foreign currency reserves means that these companies are largely dependent on the Company to make these payments on its behalf.\nIn thousands of US$\nCarrying amount\nExpected cash flows (*)\nLess than 1 year\nBetween 1 and 5 years\nMore than 5 years\nLiabilities\nLiabilities to banks\n13,857\n28,569\n2,601\n17,576\n8,392\nLoan from Koryolink\n70,905\n86,770\n--\n86,770\n--\nTrade payables and other liabilities\n15,593\n15,593\n15,593\n--\n--\nFinance lease liability\n18,633\n29,542\n3,283\n10,220\n16,039\nAs of December 31, 2023\n118,988\n160,474\n21,477\n114,566\n24,431\nThe table below analyses the Group's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.

Should these authorisations not be obtained or delayed, there could be an adverse impact on the future operations of the Group, such as a decrease in revenues or penalty payments due to contractual counterparties.\nThe telecommunications activity in Lebanon is in accordance with the agreement with the Ministry of Telecommunications for the management of Mobile Interim Company One (MIC1) which expired in\nJanuary 31, 2013, and has been renewed annually till December 2019, where the management received a letter from the ministry of telecommunications in Lebanon to terminate the contract and to proceed in handing over the management.\nPolitical and economic risk in emerging countries\nA significant amount of the Group's operations is conducted in Egypt, North Korea. The operations of the Group depend on the market economy of the countries in which the subsidiaries or associate operate. In particular, these markets are characterised by economies that are in various stages of development or are undergoing restructuring. Therefore, the operating results of the Group are affected by the current and future economic and political developments in these countries. In particular, the results of operations could be unfavourably affected by changes in the political or governmental structures or weaknesses in the local economies in the countries where it operates. These changes could also have an unfavourable impact on financial condition, performance, and business prospects.\nRegulatory risk in emerging countries\nDue to the nature of the legal and tax jurisdictions in the emerging countries where the Group operates, it is possible that laws and regulations could be amended. This could include factors such as the current tendency to withhold tax on the dividends of these subsidiaries, receiving excessive tax assessments, granting of relief to certain operations and practices relating to foreign currency exchange. These factors could have an unfavourable effect on the financial activities of the Group and on the ability to receive funds from the subsidiaries.\nRevenue generated by the majority of the Group subsidiaries is expressed in local currency. The Group expects to receive most of this revenue from its subsidiaries and therefore it relies on their ability to be able to transfer funds. The regulations in the various countries, such as North Korea, where Koryolink operates could reduce the ability to pay interest and dividends and to repay loans, credit instruments and securities expressed in foreign currency through the transfer of currency. In addition, in some countries it could be difficult to convert large amounts of foreign currency due to central bank regulations. The central banks may amend regulations in the future and therefore the ability of the Company to receive funds from its subsidiaries may change.\nClasses of financial instrument\nThe tables below present the Groups financial assets and liabilities by category.\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands of US$)\nAt amortised Cost\nAt FVTPL\nTotal\nAt amortised Cost\nAt FVTPL\nTotal\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n45,714\n--\n45,714\n73,583\n--\n73,583\nTrade receivables\n4,302\n--\n4,302\n5,208\n--\n5,208\nFinancial assets at FVTPL\n--\n28,522\n28,522\n--\n24,332\n24,332\nOther assets\n12,869\n--\n12,869\n2,057\n--\n2,057\nTotal\n62,885\n28,522\n91,407\n80,848\n24,332\n105,180\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands of US$)\nAt amortised Cost\nTotal\nAt amortised Cost\nTotal\nLiabilities\nBorrowings\n107,890\n107,890\n103,395\n103,395\nTrade payable & other liabilities\n4,903\n4,903\n15,593\n15,593\nTotal\n112,793\n112,793\n118,988\n118,988\n5.

The description of the methods through which the Group manages financial risks is contained in the following note 4 relating to \"Financial risk management\".\nFor presentational purposes, the current/non-current distinction has been used for the statement of financial position.

The indirect method has been selected to present the cash flows statement.\n2.2 Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRSs\")\n2.2.1 New currently effective requirements\nEffective date\nNew standards or amendments\nJanuary 1, 2024\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nNon-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nSupplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nLease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\nJanuary 1, 2024\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nIn the current year, the group has applied a number of amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards that are effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2023.

These policies have been applied consistently by the Group entities.\n\u00a7\nBasis of consolidation\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control.\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and the financial statements of those entities over which the Company has control, both directly and indirectly, from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date such control ceases.\nThe financial statements used in the consolidation process are those prepared by the individual Group entities in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)\n\u00a7\nConsolidation procedures used are as follows:\n-\nThe assets and liabilities and income and expenses of subsidiaries are included on a line-by-line basis, allocating to non-controlling interests, where applicable, the share of equity and profit or loss for the year that is attributable to them.\n-\nThe resulting balances are presented separately in equity and the consolidated income statement; the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations.\n-\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Group.\n-\nThe consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n-\nAny contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured, and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in consolidated profit or loss.\n-\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the interest acquired in the net fair value at the acquisition date of the assets and liabilities of the entity or business acquired. Goodwill relating to investments accounted for using the equity method is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair values of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in the consolidated profit or loss.\n-\nAcquisition costs on business combinations are expensed as incurred, except if they relate to issue debt or equity securities.\n-\nThe purchase of equity holdings from non-controlling holders are accounted for as equity transactions that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration received and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.\n-\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\u00a7\nInterests in equity-accounted investees\nThe Group's interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates and a joint venture\n.\n- Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n-\nInterests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognized at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\nThe equity method is as follows:\n-\nThe Group's share of the profit or loss of an investee is recognized in the consolidated profit or loss from the date when significant influence begins up to the date when that significant influence ceases or when the investment is classified as held for sale. Investments in associates with negative shareholders' equity are recorded till the Group's interest is reduced to zero and a provision for its losses is accrued only if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses.\n-\nThe Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and it's carrying value.\n-\nIf the ownership interest in an associate is reduced, but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in the consolidated other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated profit or loss.\n-\nUnrealized gains and losses generated from transactions between the Company, or its subsidiaries and its investees accounted for using the equity method are eliminated on consolidation for the portion pertaining to the Group; unrealized losses are eliminated unless they represent impairment.\n-\nManagement fees received from associates are included within revenue.\nAppendix A includes a list of the entities included in the scope of consolidation.\n\u00a7\nNon-controlling interests\nNon-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group's equity\" therein\".\nNon-controlling interests that represent current equity interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the net assets of the entity in liquidation, they may be measured at initial recognition either at fair value or in the Proportionate share of the non-controlling interests in the recognized values of the net assets acquired - The Measurement basis for each acquisition transaction is selected separately.\nThe non-controlling interest in an acquire is initially measured at the non-controlling interest proportionate share in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent consideration recognized on acquisition date.\n\u00a7\nForeign currency translation\nFunctional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The functional currency of the Company is Egyptian pound. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in 'US Dollars' (US$), which is the Group's presentation currency. The numbers disclosed according to the presentation currency \"US$\" represent the translation of the group financial results recognized in its functional currency \"EGP \"converted to US$ using the appropriate exchange rates\nTransactions and balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the relevant entity at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated, at the reporting date, into the prevailing exchange rates at that date. Foreign currency exchange differences arising on the settlement of transactions and the translation of the statement of financial position are recognized in the income statement. Gains and losses on long-term financing provided to Group subsidiaries by the parent company, for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur, are initially recognized in. other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income statement on disposal of the relevant entity, transaction in foreign currency for non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at historical cost are initially recorded using closing rate at the date of the transaction while items carried at fair value should be reported at the rate that existed when fair values were determined.\nIf a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in other comprehensive income, any foreign exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognized in other comprehensive income.\nGroup companies\nThe financial statements of the Group entities are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\u00b7\nAssets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\u00b7\nIncome and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.\n\u00b7\nAll resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component of equity in the \"translation reserve\" until the group loses control of the relevant subsidiary. When the group disposes of a foreign operation the translation reserve, previously recognized in equity, is transferred to the income statement.\n\u00b7\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate; and\n\u00b7\nIn the preparation of the consolidated cash flow statement, the cash flows of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate for the year, except for the opening and closing cash balances.\nThe exchange rates applied in relation to the US$ are as follows:\nAverage for the\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nClosing rate as of\nDecember 31, 2024\nAverage for the\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nClosing rate as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nEgyptian Pound (EGP)\n0.0220\n0.0196\n0.0326\n0.0324\nEuro (EUR)\n1.0817\n1.0353\n1.0815\n1.1038\nBrazilian Real (BRL)\n0.1854\n0.1620\n0.2003\n0.2061\nLBP Lebanese Pounds (LBP)\n0.00001\n0.00001\n0.00007\n0.00007\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at purchase cost or production cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for use and any dismantling and removal costs which may be incurred because of contractual obligations, which require the asset to be returned to its original state and condition.\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Each asset is treated separately if it has an autonomously determinable useful life and value. Depreciation is charged at rates calculated to write off the costs over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis from the date the asset is available and ready for use.\nThe useful lives of property and equipment and their residual values are reviewed and updated, where necessary, at least at each year-end. Land is not depreciated. When a depreciable asset is composed of identifiable separate components whose useful lives vary significantly from those of other components of the asset, depreciation is calculated for each component separately, applying the \"component approach\".\nThe useful lives estimated by the Group for the various categories of property and equipment are as follows.\nNumber of years\nBuildings\n50\nLeasehold improvements and renovations\n3-8\nMachinery\n5-10\nComputer equipment\n3-5\nFurniture and fixtures\n5-10\nVehicles\n3-6\nGains or (losses) arising from the sale or retirement of assets are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the asset sold or retired and are recognized in the income statement in the period incurred.\nLeases\nWith the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use. Each lease payment is allocated between the principal liability and finance costs. Finance costs are charged to the income statement over the lease period using the effective interest rate method.\nAs A leasee , right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; (iii) any initial direct costs and, if applicable, (iv) restoration costs. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis.\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of the following: (i) fixed lease payments, (ii) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate and, if applicable, (iii) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, and (iv) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option. Lease liabilities do not include any non-lease components that may be included in the related contracts.\nLease payments are subsequently measured at amortized cost and discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the entire term of the contract, unless the contract provides for the transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or the cost of the lease reflects the fact that the lessee will exercise the purchase option. In this case, the depreciation must be the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the duration of the contract. The estimated useful lives for right-of-use assets are calculated according to the same criterion applied to owned tangible assets. In addition, the right-of-use asset is decreased by any impairment losses and adjusted to reflect any remeasurement of the associated lease liability.\nIn the statement of financial position, the Group presents right-of-use assets within property and equipment and lease liabilities within current and non-current borrowings.\nIn the income statement, interest expense on lease liabilities constitutes a component of financial expenses and is shown separately from the depreciation of right-of-use assets.\nSale and leaseback\nAn entity (the seller-lessee) transfers an asset to another entity (the buyer-lessor) and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor, both the seller-lessee and the buyer-lessor shall account for the transfer contract and the lease.\nAssessing whether the transfer of the asset is a sale\nAn entity shall apply the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset.\nTransfer of the asset is a sale.\nIf the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset:\nThe seller-lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, the seller-lessee shall recognise only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.\nIf the fair value of the consideration for the sale of an asset does not equal the fair value of the asset, or if the payments for the lease are not at market rates, an entity shall make the following adjustments to measure the sale proceeds at fair value:\n\u00b7\nAny below-market terms shall be accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments; and\n\u00b7\nAny above-market terms shall be accounted for as additional financing provided by the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee.\nTransfer of the asset is not a sale :\nIf the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee does not satisfy the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the seller-lessee shall continue to recognise the transferred asset and shall recognise a financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds. It shall account for the financial liability applying IFRS 9.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life - for example, goodwill- are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. In determining an asset's value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects the market's current assessment of the cost of money for the investment period and the specific risk profile of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units, \"CGU\"). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognized immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.\nInvestment property\nInvestment properties are property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held by the Group to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are initially measured at cost. The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure.\nDirectly attributable expenditure includes, for example, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group has elected to measure investment properties at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\nInvestment property is derecognized upon disposal, when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits expected from its disposal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of investment property are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated profit or loss in the period of the retirement or disposal. Reclassifications to / from investment property are made when, and only when, there is a change of use.\nRevenue from operating lease rentals is recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant term of the lease. The rental income generated by investment properties is recognized within revenues in the consolidated income statement.\nDepreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of the investment properties. The estimated useful lives of leased units are estimated at 50 years.\nFinancial assets\n\u00a7\nRecognition and measurement\nTrade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\u00a7\nClassification and Subsequent Measurement\nThe Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories:\n\u00b7\nAmortized cost\n\u00b7\nFVOCI - debt investment\n\u00b7\nFVOCI - equity investment or\n\u00b7\nFVTPL.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\u00b7\nIt is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\u00b7\nIts contractual terms give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:\n\u00b7\nIt is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n\u00b7\nIts contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\u00a7\nFinancial assets - Business model assessment\nThe Group assesses the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:\n\u00b7\nThe stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities, or expected cash outflows or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets.\n\u00b7\nHow the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management.\n\u00b7\nthe risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed.\n\u00b7\nHow managers of the business are compensated - e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n\u00b7\nThe frequency, volume, and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.\nFinancial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.\n\u00a7\nAssessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\u00b7\nContingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows.\n\u00b7\nterms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable-rate features.\n\u00b7\nprepayment and extension features; and\n\u00b7\nterms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non-recourse features).\n\u00a7\nFinancial assets - Subsequent measurement and gains and losses\nFinancial assets at FVTPL\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\nFinancial assets at amortized cost\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairments losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\n\u00a7\nFinancial liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.\n\u00a7\nDerecognition\nFinancial assets are derecognized when one of the following conditions is met:\n\u00b7\nThe contractual right to receive the cash flows from the asset has expired.\n\u00b7\nThe Group has substantially transferred all of the risks and rewards related to the asset, transferring its rights to receive the cash flows from the asset or assuming a contractual obligation to pass the cash flows received to one or more beneficiaries by virtue of an agreement that meets the requirements set out in IFRS 9 (pass through test)\n\u00b7\nThe Group has not transferred nor substantially maintained all the risks and rewards related to the financial asset but has transferred control.\n\u00a7\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (\"ECL\") on\n:\n-\nTrade receivables related to fees and commission under the scope of IFRS 15 (\"Revenues from Contracts with Customers\")\n- Financial assets measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI. The Group applies a simplified approach to measure some of these assets. For further information, please, refer to the section 3. Use of estimates and critical judgments- Impairment of financial assets.\nImpairment losses on financial assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under \"Impairment loss of other financial assets\".\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\nFor trade receivables related to fees and commission, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.\nFor financial assets measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. However, a lifetime ECLs is elected if the credit risk on the financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition.\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nand default\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\u00a7\nThere is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or the information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without considering any collateral held by the Group);\nor\n\u00a7\nThe financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate\nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).\nECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets are credit impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\u00b7\nSignificant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer.\n\u00b7\nA breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due.\n\u00b7\nThe restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise.\n\u00b7\nIt is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or another financial reorganization; or\n\u00b7\nThe disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nPresentation of allowance for ECL\nECL for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.\nFor financial instruments at FVOCI, the ECL is charged to consolidated profit or loss and is recognized in OCI.\nWrite-off\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. The Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due. Subsequent recoveries of an asset that was previously written off are recognized as a reversal of impairment in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the recovery occurs.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities consisting of borrowings, trade payables and other obligations are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the related contractual clauses and are initially recognized at fair value, adjusted by any directly attributable transaction costs.\nFinancial liabilities and trade payables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method\n\u00a7\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nThe financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, namely when the contractual obligation has been met, cancelled, or prescribed. An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different contractual terms, must be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the contractual terms of an existing financial liability must be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.\nFinance income and finance costs\nThe Group's finance income and finance costs include:\n\u00b7\nInterest income.\n\u00b7\nInterest expense.\n\u00b7\nDividend income.\n\u00b7\nNet gain or loss on financial assets at FVTPL.\n\u00b7\nForeign currency gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities; impairment losses (and reversals).\nInterest income or expense is recognised under the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.\nThe 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, or the amortised cost of the financial liability.\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit\u2011impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit\u2011impaired after initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit\u2011impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\nInterest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash-flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized using the original effective interest rate.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.\nThe group recognize loss allowances for ECL on the cash closing balance.\nT\nhe group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.\nCurrent and deferred income tax\nThe tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in equity.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred income tax is recognized, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the near future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\nProvisions\nProvisions are only recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events that will probably result in a future outflow of resources, and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The amount provided represents the best estimate of the present value of the outlay required to meet the obligation. The interest rate used in determining the present value of the liability reflects current market rates and considers the specific risk of each liability.\nEarnings per share\nBasic Earnings Per Share:\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company, both from continuing and discontinued operations, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share:\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of the Company outstanding during the year where, compared to basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares outstanding is modified to include the conversion of all dilutive potential shares, while the profit for the year is modified to include the effects of such conversion net of taxation. Diluted earnings per share are not calculated when there are losses as any dilutive effect would improve earnings per share.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nShort\u2011term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\nShare-based payment arrangements\nThe grant\u2011date fair value of equity\u2011settled share\u2011based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally known as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards.\nThe amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non\u2011market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non\u2011market performance conditions at the vesting date.\nFor share\u2011based payment awards with non\u2011vesting conditions, the grant\u2011date fair value of the share\u2011based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true\u2011up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\nThe fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of SARs, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at\neach reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value of the SARs. Any changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss.\nTermination benefits\nTermination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date, then they are discounted.\nBusiness Combination\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combination, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises:\n\u00b7\nFair values of the assets transferred.\n\u00b7\nLiabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business.\n\u00b7\nEquity interests issued by the group.\n\u00b7\nFair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and.\n\u00b7\nFair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe excess of the\n:\n\u00b7\nConsideration transferred.\n\u00b7\nAmount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and\n\u00b7\nAcquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity\nOver the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly on profit or loss as a bargain purchase.\nWhere the settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\nContingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated profit or loss.\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquire is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in the consolidated profit or loss.\nIn case that initial treatment of business combination is not complete at the end of financial period consolidated, the group recognizes temporary amounts for accounts and during the measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The adjustment is performed retrospectively for completion of new information (Intangible assets, deferred taxes/provisions, and others).\nSegment reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with the internal reporting information provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors of the Company.\nDiscontinued operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earliest of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nThe company recognizes revenue based on the following five steps:\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the contract with the client.\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the contractual obligation to transport goods and/or services (known as performance obligations).\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the price of the transaction.\n\u00b7\nAllocation of the transaction price to performance obligations determined based on the independent selling price for each good or service.\n\u00b7\nRecognition of income upon fulfilment of the relevant performance obligation.\nThe Group does not recognize any assets associated with the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer that are expected to be not recovered. The majority of revenue is recognized over a period of time and the Group applies the practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that would otherwise be recognized is one year or less.\nSpecifically, the Group mainly recognizes revenue from entertainment and Other trading activities.\nThe following is a statement of the group revenues and how to define each revenue\n:\nA.\nRevenue from Entertainment Segment\nRevenue from entertainment segment is predominantly generated by Orascom pyramids entertainment (\"OPE\") and Orascom sound and light \"OSL\" which includes Sound and light shows and entertainment activities and the pyramids site.\nA.1 Orascom pyramids entertainment (\"OPE\")\n\u00b7\nRental income: Rental income is recognized according to the accrual basis and in the straight-line manner according to the essence of the lease agreement.\n\u00b7\nSponsorship Revenue: Care income is recognized by the distribution of sponsorship consideration on a straight-line basis over the duration of the sponsorship contract.\n\u00b7\nEvents revenue: Events revenue is recognized when performing event for customers and no revenue is recognized in case of uncertainty of refund for this revenue or associated costs.\nA-2 Orascom sound and light \"OSL\n\u00b7\nRevenues of sound and light shows: - It is represented in the revenues resulting from sound light shows presented within the archaeological pyramids area.\nB.\nRevenue from investment property Segment\nRevenue from investment property is recognized according to the accrual basis and in the straight-line manner according to the rental contract duration.\nC.\nRevenue from other trading activities\nRevenue from other trading activities is predominantly generated by O-Trade and Blue EV recognized according to the accrual basis based on agreement and revenue recognition criteria.\nEBITDA Definition (Alternative performance measure)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA).\n\u00b7\nA management has presented the performance measure adjusted EBITDA because it monitors this performance measure at a consolidated level, and it believes that this measure is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting profit from continuing operations to exclude the impact of taxation, net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation, impairment losses/reversals related to goodwill, intangible assets, and other financial assets.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a defined performance measure in IFRS Accounting Standards. The Group's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities.\nRepurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)\nWhen shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.\n3. Use of estimates and critical judgements\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires that the directors apply accounting policies and methodologies that, in some circumstances, are based upon complex and subjective judgments and estimates that are based on historical experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable and realistic at the time, considering the relevant circumstances for example the assessment of control over subsidiaries and associates as well as the impairment of goodwill amount. The application of such estimates and assumptions affects the amounts recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and cash flows, as well as in the notes. Actual results might differ from such estimates due to the uncertainty surrounding the assumptions and conditions upon which estimates are based. The accounting estimates that require the more subjective judgment of management in making assumptions or estimates regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which changes in conditions may significantly affect the results reported in these Consolidated Financial Statements are summarised below.\nA.\nValuation of financial instruments - Note (17)\n-\n'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non\u2011performance risk.\n-\nA number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non\u2011financial assets and liabilities\n-\nWhen one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as 'active' if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis\n-\nIf there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction.\n-\nIf an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Group measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.\n-\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price - i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out.\nB.\nFair value hierarchy\nFor fair value measurement recognized in the statement of financial position, IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements based on a fair value hierarchy, with the following levels, by reference to the significance of the inputs used in making measurement:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for items identical to the asset being measured.\n\u00b7\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable.\n\u00b7\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are usually determined based on management's assumptions. However, Level 3 inputs must reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when determining an appropriate price for the asset.\nFair value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant that are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure.\nTherefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the funds the Group invest into have their own assumptions that are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed.\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by various funds in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nWhen determining fair value, the funds use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation techniques used by the funds to determine fair value are consistent with the market or income approaches. The market approach includes valuation techniques that use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities. The funds generally use the market approach to value exchange-traded securities.\nThe funds value equity securities that are traded on a national securities exchange at their last reported sales price. The funds generally value equity securities traded in the over the counter (OTC) markets and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date at their last reported bid price if held long, and last reported ask price if sold short. To the extent that equity securities are actively traded, and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments such as short-term trade receivables, trade payables, other receivables, and other payables, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value.\nC.\nImpairment of non-current assets\nNon-current assets are reviewed to determine whether there are any indications that the net carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and that they have suffered an impairment loss that needs to be recognized. In order to determine whether any such elements exist, it is necessary to make subjective measurements, based on information obtained within the Group, in the market and on past experience. When indicators are identified that an asset may have become impaired, the Group estimates the impairment loss using suitable valuation techniques. The identification of elements indicating that a potential impairment exists and estimates of the amount of the impairment, depend on factors that may vary in time, affecting management's assessments and estimates.\nD.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group applies a simplified approach to measure expected credit losses of trade receivables related to fees and commission and financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. In a simplified approach expected credit losses are measured on the basis of a lifetime or 12-month expected loss allowance. The expected credit losses are based on historical information on actual credit losses on receivables. The model considers other information on the future economic conditions available at the time of the measurement.\nE.\nDiscontinued operation\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations, and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:\n- Represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations.\n- Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or\n- Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held\u2011for\u2011sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and OCI is re\u2011presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\nF.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets constitute a significant part of the Group's total assets and the scheduled amortisation charges from a significant part of the annual operation expenses. The useful economic lives arrived at, on the basis of management's estimates and assumptions, have a major impact on the valuation of intangible assets.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the intangible asset is estimated, in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, intangible assets are allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\nG.\nSignificant influence in North Korea\nThe Company's investment in North Korea relates primarily to the 60% voting rights in the local telecom operator Koryolink. The accounting treatment has been modified during 2015 through recognizing it as an investment in associates instead of subsidiaries, as the OIH (Egypt) Group management believes in the existence of significant influence instead of control.\nIn the light of international sanctions that the United States administration has decided to impose on the North Korean government and its various departments, the OIH (Egypt) Group's management closely monitors ongoing activities to make sure that the sanctions are not violated, and the two sides reached some understanding of the organizational and commercial frameworks focused on organizing the work of telecommunications market in North Korea.\nThe accounting treatment has been modified during period ended September 30, 2015, though recognizing it as an investment in associates instead of investment in subsidiaries, as the Group management believes that the existence of significant influence instead of control\nThe accounting treatment has been modified during period ended September 30, 2015, though recognizing it as an investment in associates instead of investment in subsidiaries, as the Group's management believes that the existence of significant influence instead of control due to the increase of the restrictions, financial and operating difficulties facing Koryolink due to the international sanction imposed by the international community including the United States of America, the European Union, and the United Nations.\"\nThese sanctions have the effect of restricting financial transactions and the import and export of goods and services, including goods and services required to operate, maintain, and develop mobile networks. In addition, the restrictions implemented affect the ability of its associate to transfer profits to the parent (return of funds to its native).\nOn September 11, 2017, the United Nations Security Council issued a resolution obliging member state of the United Nations to pass laws prohibiting joint ventures and existing partnerships with the North Korean Republic unless approval is obtained to continue such joint ventures.\nThe Group's management submitted an official request through Ministry of the foreign affairs of the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to be excluded from adhering to the said resolution.\nOn December 26, 2018, the request to the Security Council Committee established to follow up the implementation of sanctions on North Korea was approved, with the exception of Koryolink, to ban foreign investment in North Korea and to allow Orascom Investment Holding to continue its activities in North Korea. And consider the company as a telecommunications infrastructure company offering a public service.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, Koryolink announced an increase in the company's capital by about 20 million euros, and KPTC, the shareholder of Koryolink by 25% at that time, subscribed to the entire shares of the capital increase, with Orascom Investment Holding refraining from subscribing to it. This increase led to a Dilution of Orascom Investment Holding's shareholding in Koryolink from 75% to 60%.\nShare capital\nEuro*\n%\nOrascom Investment Holding SAE\n60,000,000\n60%\nPost office Co.at North Korea\n40,000,000\n40%\nTotal\n100,000,000\n100%\n\\* The functional currency for Koryolink is Euro.\nH.\nDepreciation of non-current assets\nThe cost of property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis throughout the useful economic life of the relevant asset. The useful economic life is determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and is based upon historical experience for similar assets, market conditions, and forecasts regarding future events that could have an impact on useful life, including changes in technology. Therefore, the actual useful economic life may differ from the estimated useful life. The Group periodically evaluates sector and technology changes in order to update the remaining useful life. Such periodic updates could result in a change during the depreciation period, and therefore also in the depreciation in future periods.\nI.\nTaxes\nIncome taxes (both current income tax and deferred taxes) are determined in each country whereby the\nGroup operates in accordance with a prudent interpretation of the applicable tax regulations.\nThis process results in complex estimates in determining taxable and deductible income and taxable temporary differences between accounting and tax values. In particular, deferred tax assets are recognized when it is probable that there will be future taxable income against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, in relation to tax losses that can be used in future periods and deductible temporary differences, considers the estimated future taxable income on the basis of a prudent tax planning.\nJ.\nProvisions and contingent liabilities\nManagement assesses events and circumstances indicating that the Group may have an obligation resulting in the ordinary course of business, Management applies its judgment in determining whether the recognition criteria have been met through assessing the probability of the obligation, making assumptions about timing and amounts of future cash outflows expected to settle the obligation.\n4. Financial Risk Management\nFinancial risk factors\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. In particular, the Group is exposed to risks from movements in exchange rates, interest rates and market prices. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's performance through ongoing operational and finance activities. The management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework\n.\ni)\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure with acceptable parameters, while optimizing the returns.\nThe Group's strategy is aimed wherever possible at eliminating currency risk and managing derivatives in compliance with the policies and strategies defined within the Group, taking into consideration the different effects that these instruments could have on the profit or loss and the statement of financial position as a function of their classification and accounting treatment.\nii)\nForeign exchange risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising when its business transactions are in currencies other than its functional currency. The main currencies to which the Group is exposed are the US dollar (\"US$\"), the Euro (\"EUR\"), DPRK Won (\"KPW\") , Brazilian Real (\"BRL\") , Lebanese Pound( LBP) and the Egyptian Pound (\"EGP\").\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk arising in two separate ways:\na)\nForeign exchange operations risk\nThe Group entities predominantly execute their operating activities in their respective functional currencies. Some Group subsidiaries are, however, exposed to foreign currency risks in connection with scheduled payments in currencies that are not their functional currencies.\nIn general, this relates to foreign currency denominated supplier payables due to capital expenditures and receivables. The Group monitors the exposure to foreign currency risk on a group basis.\nManagement has set up a policy to require Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. In addition, the Group manages foreign currency risk by matching its principal cash outflows to the currency in which the principal cash inflows are denominated. This is generally achieved by obtaining loan financing in the relevant currency\nAt year end, major net assets / (net liabilities) foreign currencies positions presented in 'US Dollars' (US$), were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nin currency\n(Liabilities)\nin currency\nNet assets/(liabilities) in currency\nNet assets/(liabilities)\nin US$\nUS$\n101,083\n(2,780)\n98,303\n98,303\nLBP\n76,064,187\n(42,202,771)\n33,861,416\n2,257\nEuro\n84,052\n(65,713)\n18,339\n20,242\nGBP\n1\n--\n1\n2\nBRL\n11,310\n(1,781)\n9,529\n1,964\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets\nin currency\n(Liabilities)\nin currency\nNet assets/(liabilities) in currency\nNet assets/(liabilities)\nin US$\nUS$\n81,537\n1,397\n80,141\n80,141\nLBP\n645,116,211\n- 110,603,558\n755,719,769\n5,971\nEuro\n110,043\n87,413\n22,630\n23,429\nGBP\n108\n-\n108\n2\nBRL\n8,149\n2,012\n6,137\n994\nb)\nAs of December 31, 2024, if the functional currencies had increased/(decreased) by 10% against the US$, Euro, BRL, and GBP with all other variables held constant, the translation of foreign currency would have resulted in an increase / (decrease) of US$ $ 7,539 thousand and LBP 493 and Euro of 16,895 as well as BRL 136 of net profit\n(2023: US$ $ (8,981) thousand and Euro of (349) and LBP 226 as well as BRL 7,565 of net profit.\nc)\nForeign exchange translation risk\nDue to its international presence, the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, as these affect the translation of subsidiaries' assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the US$ (the Group's presentational currency). The currencies concerned are mainly the Egyptian pound, and the Euro. This represents a translational risk rather than a financial risk given that these movements are posted directly to equity in the cumulative translation reserve\niii)\nPrice risk\nThe Group has no exposure to equity instruments of other entities that are publicly traded.\niv)\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nThe Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings received at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.\nAll borrowings from banks outstanding as of December 31, 2024, US$ 17,391thousand (December 31, 2023 US$ 32,490 thousand) note 23 are at a fixed interest rate, at a variable interest rate and interest rate free.\nThe Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. The Group calculates the impact on the consolidated profit or loss of a defined interest rate shift. The same interest rate shift is used for all currencies.\nThe impact of a 1% interest rate shift would be a maximum increase/decrease in 2024 finance costs of US$ 0.251 million.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the maximum credit exposure.\nImpairment losses on financial assets and contract assets recognized in profit or loss were as follow: -\n(In thousands of US$)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nImpairment loss on trade receivables (note 19)\n(43)\n(3,963)\nImpairment loss on other assets (note\n20\n)\n--\n(52)\nImpairment loss of other financial assets (note 17)\n(13,065)\n(45,019)\nImpairment loss in cash and cash equivalent (\nnote 21)\n(892)\n(414)\nTotal\n(14,000)\n(49,448)\n\u00b7\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Group Companies have placed funds with the following financial institutions based on their credit rating: -\nRating\nName of Bank\n2024\n2023\nArab Bank Zurich\nBB\nBB\nCA Indosuez LU\nA+\nA+\nCredit Agricole Egypt\nA+\nA+\nQNB Bank\nBB-\nB-\nFAB Bank\nAA-\nAA-\nBank Masr\nB\nB-\nBanco General S. A\nBBB-\nBBB-\nAudi Bank\nCCC\nCCC\nThe Group held cash and cash equivalents of\nUS$\n45,714 million (2023:\nUS$\n73,583 million) with banks which are rated BB and A+ based on Standard & Poor and are considered to have low credit risk. The cash balances are measured on 12-month expected credit losses.\nThe Group held cash of US$ 1.2 million in a Lebanese bank as at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: US$ 0.552 million). Considering Lebanon's economic and financial crisis represented in hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and significant restrictions on foreign currency transfers, the Group assessed the recoverability of these cash balances and accordingly, The Group decided to fully impair the total cash balance.\nDuring August 2022, Koryolink decided, at the request of a shareholder in the company, to grant shareholders, without discrimination, a non-interest loan in accordance with the rules and procedures of local law, according to the percentage of its contribution to the company's capital. Accordingly, a cash amounting to US$ 86 million was transferred to the account of Orascom Investment Holding Company bank account in the Republic of Korea, knowing that all local regulations and laws regarding bank transfers and transactions will be applied to the mentioned amounts, and Orascom Investment Company will continue to comply with international sanctions resolutions in this regard.\nDuring December 2024, Koryolink Company granted all shareholders additional interest free loan amounted to EUR 30 million (equivalent to US$31 million as of 31 December 2024) transferred to Orascom investment holding bank account.\nOIH S.A.E. management performed ECL assessment on the cash received from Koryolink Loan and considered that there is 50% likelihood of recoverability due to the unpredictability of future developments, including potential changes in international sanctions, regulatory restrictions. Therefore, 50% ECL was recorded as at 31 December 2023 and December 2024.\n\u00b7\nTrade receivables\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. Details of concentration of revenue are included in notes 6.\nThe risk management committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group's review includes external ratings, if they are available, financial statements, credit agency information, industry information and in some cases bank references. Sale limits are established for each customer and reviewed quarterly. Any sales exceeding those limits require approval from the risk management committee.\nIn monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or a legal entity, whether they are a wholesale, retail or end-user customer, their geographic location, industry, trading history with the Group and existence of previous financial difficulties.\nThe Group is monitoring the economic environment in Brazil and is taking actions to limit its exposure to customers in countries experiencing particular economic volatility and discussion with government of Lebanon regarding releasing of the dues.\nThe Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.\nThe Group does not have trade receivable and contract assets for which no loss allowance is recognized because of collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the exposure to credit risk for trade receivables risk and contract assets by Geographic region was as follows:\n-\n(In thousands of US$)\nCarrying amount December 31, 2024\nCarrying amount December 31, 2023\nEgypt\n1,064\n2,009\nBrazil\n98\n685\nLebanon\n3,140\n2,514\nTotal\n4,302\n5,208\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by type of counterparty was as follows: -\n(In thousands of US$)\nCarrying amount December 31, 2024\nCarrying amount December 31, 2023\nEntertainment\n1,064\n2,009\nRentals\n98\n685\nGSM\n3,140\n2,514\nTotal\n4,302\n5,208\nvii)\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Group monitors and mitigates liquidity risk arising from the uncertainty of cash inflows and outflows by maintaining sufficient liquidity of cash balances. In general, liquidity risk is monitored at entity level whereby each subsidiary is responsible for managing and monitoring its cash flows and rolling liquidity reserve forecast in order to ensure that it has sufficient committed facilities to meet its liquidity needs.\nLaws and regulations in certain countries, such as North Korea, in which the Group operates limit the conversion of current cash balances into foreign currency. Given the nature of the business, Group companies may have to make payments in foreign currencies (for example capital expenditures), the lack of individual entity foreign currency reserves means that these companies are largely dependent on the Company to make these payments on its behalf.\nIn thousands of US$\nCarrying amount\nExpected cash flows (*)\nLess than 1 year\nBetween 1 and 5 years\nMore than 5 years\nLiabilities\nLiabilities to banks\n13,857\n28,569\n2,601\n17,576\n8,392\nLoan from Koryolink\n70,905\n86,770\n--\n86,770\n--\nTrade payables and other liabilities\n15,593\n15,593\n15,593\n--\n--\nFinance lease liability\n18,633\n29,542\n3,283\n10,220\n16,039\nAs of December 31, 2023\n118,988\n160,474\n21,477\n114,566\n24,431\nThe table below analyses the Group's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.

Should these authorisations not be obtained or delayed, there could be an adverse impact on the future operations of the Group, such as a decrease in revenues or penalty payments due to contractual counterparties.\nThe telecommunications activity in Lebanon is in accordance with the agreement with the Ministry of Telecommunications for the management of Mobile Interim Company One (MIC1) which expired in\nJanuary 31, 2013, and has been renewed annually till December 2019, where the management received a letter from the ministry of telecommunications in Lebanon to terminate the contract and to proceed in handing over the management.\nPolitical and economic risk in emerging countries\nA significant amount of the Group's operations is conducted in Egypt, North Korea. The operations of the Group depend on the market economy of the countries in which the subsidiaries or associate operate. In particular, these markets are characterised by economies that are in various stages of development or are undergoing restructuring. Therefore, the operating results of the Group are affected by the current and future economic and political developments in these countries. In particular, the results of operations could be unfavourably affected by changes in the political or governmental structures or weaknesses in the local economies in the countries where it operates. These changes could also have an unfavourable impact on financial condition, performance, and business prospects.\nRegulatory risk in emerging countries\nDue to the nature of the legal and tax jurisdictions in the emerging countries where the Group operates, it is possible that laws and regulations could be amended. This could include factors such as the current tendency to withhold tax on the dividends of these subsidiaries, receiving excessive tax assessments, granting of relief to certain operations and practices relating to foreign currency exchange. These factors could have an unfavourable effect on the financial activities of the Group and on the ability to receive funds from the subsidiaries.\nRevenue generated by the majority of the Group subsidiaries is expressed in local currency. The Group expects to receive most of this revenue from its subsidiaries and therefore it relies on their ability to be able to transfer funds. The regulations in the various countries, such as North Korea, where Koryolink operates could reduce the ability to pay interest and dividends and to repay loans, credit instruments and securities expressed in foreign currency through the transfer of currency. In addition, in some countries it could be difficult to convert large amounts of foreign currency due to central bank regulations. The central banks may amend regulations in the future and therefore the ability of the Company to receive funds from its subsidiaries may change.\nClasses of financial instrument\nThe tables below present the Groups financial assets and liabilities by category.\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands of US$)\nAt amortised Cost\nAt FVTPL\nTotal\nAt amortised Cost\nAt FVTPL\nTotal\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n45,714\n--\n45,714\n73,583\n--\n73,583\nTrade receivables\n4,302\n--\n4,302\n5,208\n--\n5,208\nFinancial assets at FVTPL\n--\n28,522\n28,522\n--\n24,332\n24,332\nOther assets\n12,869\n--\n12,869\n2,057\n--\n2,057\nTotal\n62,885\n28,522\n91,407\n80,848\n24,332\n105,180\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands of US$)\nAt amortised Cost\nTotal\nAt amortised Cost\nTotal\nLiabilities\nBorrowings\n107,890\n107,890\n103,395\n103,395\nTrade payable & other liabilities\n4,903\n4,903\n15,593\n15,593\nTotal\n112,793\n112,793\n118,988\n118,988\n5.
