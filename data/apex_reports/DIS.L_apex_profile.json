(grocery till data, Worldpanel)\nPerformance at store level within the grocery channel was buoyant, predominantly driven by competitive price promotion and supplemented with the new RedLeg pack (see announcement 6 January 2026), which began to hit shelves mid-December, boosting rate of sale.\nIn the on-trade, value sales increased 1.9%, however on-trade prices have been pushed up from the previous year due to continued pressures facing the trade, including the duty increase in 2025, along with ongoing inflationary rises across the supply chain and increased staffing costs. A Barclays consumer spending report (released January 2026) highlighted that 39% of consumers surveyed saying rising costs prevented them from going out as often as they would have liked in December.\nHowever, the increased sales at consumer level is not reflected in Distil's reported sales outturn in Q3 due to existing stock holdings within the trade. Inventory acquired by distributors to cover the Christmas trading period were predominantly built in Q2, and there is overall pressure across the supply chain to work with more efficient stock levels, with retailers running stock cover at a lower level.\nExport markets\nGlobal market conditions continue to be tough across the beverage alcohol industry, including spirits, as consumer confidence remains fragile. However, the quarter saw some encouraging wins for our business within this market.\nExport markets revenues increased 7.5x year-on-year, albeit from a small base, due to altered order phasing in our largest market.\nFollowing unexpected delays due to government closures, approvals were received for Blavod from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in the US, signifying that the brand can now be prepared to ship for sales in the US market. Distil is working with Aiko Spirits, with whom we agreed a US distribution deal, to ensure that the process of getting product landed is as smooth as possible, and that marketing plans are in place to ensure that the brand is supported.\nOther news\nAs announced via RNS Reach on 12 January 2026, the quarter also saw us secure a significant on-trade listing for Blackwoods with an award-winning Scottish group of 22 bars and restaurants, Buzzworks, with Blackwoods gin and vodka featuring in multiple cocktails across the estate.\nStrategy\nThe initial stage of our formal strategic review, together with review of the cost structure of the business, led to the fundraise announced on 15 September 2025). The fundraise enabled us to build stocks for Christmas trading, finalise the RedLeg packaging refresh, set-up the EU distribution solution, and progress the Blackwoods Brand Home. Given current marketing conditions, we are keeping our strategic options under continual review to maximise shareholder value.\nOutlook\nThe medium-term outlook continues to be challenging for the industry. A further alcohol duty increase announced in the latest UK budget, effective February 2026, will further squeeze consumer spending and prolong market recovery. This is particularly true in the hospitality sector, which has been hit from all sides with increases in duty, business rates, national insurance, and utility bills. The on-trade is not only key to the alcohol sector, but to society more widely. We will continue to support our customers as best we can, as well as continue to voice our concerns together with colleagues in the industry to members of parliament.\nWe will continue strategic support across on- and off-trade customers to build on momentum at consumer level, including the opening of the Blackwoods Brand Home, due by the end of January, with tour bookings to be announced in the near future.\nEnquiries:\nFor further information, please contact:\nDistil PLC\nDon Goulding, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 203 283 4006\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\n(NOMAD)\nNeil Baldwin\nMark Brady\nTel: +44 203 368 3550\nAllenby Capital Ltd\n(Broker)\nJames Reeve/Piers Shimwell\nMatt Butlin/Jos Pinnington\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

      "why_they_matter": "The company targets a niche segment of the UK retail market, which can offer high margins if it gains traction, making it a potential high\u2011risk, high\u2011reward play for traders looking for upside.",
      "current_state": "DIS.L is struggling; it has fallen 93.6% from its peak, shows no clear revenue trajectory and is currently trading at zero pence, indicating severe liquidity and valuation issues."

        "bear_narrative": "Bear voices point out that the company has no revenue, its price is zero, and there is no search or social media traction, so they argue the story is a dead end.",
        "sentiment_shift": "Sentiment has stayed flat over the past month; there was no surge in enthusiasm after the latest filings, and the lack of buzz indicates that traders are not excited about the narrative."
      },
      "attention_check": "Google Trends shows a completely flat interest score of 0/100, and no ShareChat posts have been recorded, meaning that the story has not captured public attention and is effectively oxygen\u2011deprived."

      ],
      "watch_for": "Monitor for any director selling activity, rumors of a placement, or sudden changes in the board composition. The bull case hinges on a surprise revenue figure or a strategic partnership that can turn the narrative around.",
      "timing_regime": "The APEX timing regime indicates an exhausted cycle; the story has been on the market for months with no new momentum, meaning any entry is late and carries a high probability of downside."

      "lean": "Neutral",

      "bear_case": "The absence of revenue, flat search interest, and no social buzz suggest that the company is unlikely to deliver the turnaround it claims. Without a clear catalyst, the price is expected to stay at or near zero.",

      "if_bullish": "If you decide to take a small position, start with 2\u20133% of your allocated capital, set a tight stop at 0.02p to limit loss, and add on only after a positive earnings report or a clear sign of product traction.",
      "if_watching": "Hold off until the Q2 results or the AGM provide concrete data. A revenue print or a strategic partnership would justify a re\u2011entry; otherwise, stay out until the story shows traction.",
      "if_passing": "The story lacks momentum, there are no tangible performance metrics, and the risk of a price collapse is high. It is safer to pass and focus on more promising micro\u2011cap opportunities."
