          "content": "19 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 3043P\nDistil PLC\n19 January 2026\nDistil PLC\nTrading Update\nDistil plc (AIM: DIS), owner of premium drinks brands including RedLeg Spiced Rum, Blackwoods Gin and Vodka, and Blavod Black Vodka, provides a trading update for the third quarter (October - December 2025) of its current financial year ending 31 March 2026.\nUnaudited year-on-year third quarter (October to December 2025) results:\n\u00b7\nRevenues decreased 26% to \u00a3173k (October to December 2024: \u00a3233k)\n\u00b7\nVolumes into distributors decreased 39%\no\nVolumes at consumer level increased 36%\n\u00b7\nGross margins were flat at 42% (October to December 2024: 42%)\nDon Goulding, Executive Chairman of Distil, commented:\n\"Sales of RedLeg by retailers to end consumers across major grocery, a key contributor to our business, increased 36% overall year-on-year in Q3, and +28% year-on-year in the four weeks to 28 December, despite a 4.1% decline in consumer spending on total take-home alcohol in the same period. (grocery till data, Worldpanel)\nPerformance at store level within the grocery channel was buoyant, predominantly driven by competitive price promotion and supplemented with the new RedLeg pack (see announcement 6 January 2026), which began to hit shelves mid-December, boosting rate of sale.\nIn the on-trade, value sales increased 1.9%, however on-trade prices have been pushed up from the previous year due to continued pressures facing the trade, including the duty increase in 2025, along with ongoing inflationary rises across the supply chain and increased staffing costs. A Barclays consumer spending report (released January 2026) highlighted that 39% of consumers surveyed saying rising costs prevented them from going out as often as they would have liked in December.\nHowever, the increased sales at consumer level is not reflected in Distil's reported sales outturn in Q3 due to existing stock holdings within the trade. Inventory acquired by distributors to cover the Christmas trading period were predominantly built in Q2, and there is overall pressure across the supply chain to work with more efficient stock levels, with retailers running stock cover at a lower level.\nExport markets\nGlobal market conditions continue to be tough across the beverage alcohol industry, including spirits, as consumer confidence remains fragile. However, the quarter saw some encouraging wins for our business within this market.\nExport markets revenues increased 7.5x year-on-year, albeit from a small base, due to altered order phasing in our largest market.\nFollowing unexpected delays due to government closures, approvals were received for Blavod from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in the US, signifying that the brand can now be prepared to ship for sales in the US market. Distil is working with Aiko Spirits, with whom we agreed a US distribution deal, to ensure that the process of getting product landed is as smooth as possible, and that marketing plans are in place to ensure that the brand is supported.\nOther news\nAs announced via RNS Reach on 12 January 2026, the quarter also saw us secure a significant on-trade listing for Blackwoods with an award-winning Scottish group of 22 bars and restaurants, Buzzworks, with Blackwoods gin and vodka featuring in multiple cocktails across the estate.\nStrategy\nThe initial stage of our formal strategic review, together with review of the cost structure of the business, led to the fundraise announced on 15 September 2025). The fundraise enabled us to build stocks for Christmas trading, finalise the RedLeg packaging refresh, set-up the EU distribution solution, and progress the Blackwoods Brand Home. Given current marketing conditions, we are keeping our strategic options under continual review to maximise shareholder value.\nOutlook\nThe medium-term outlook continues to be challenging for the industry. A further alcohol duty increase announced in the latest UK budget, effective February 2026, will further squeeze consumer spending and prolong market recovery. This is particularly true in the hospitality sector, which has been hit from all sides with increases in duty, business rates, national insurance, and utility bills. The on-trade is not only key to the alcohol sector, but to society more widely. We will continue to support our customers as best we can, as well as continue to voice our concerns together with colleagues in the industry to members of parliament.\nWe will continue strategic support across on- and off-trade customers to build on momentum at consumer level, including the opening of the Blackwoods Brand Home, due by the end of January, with tour bookings to be announced in the near future.\nEnquiries:\nFor further information, please contact:\nDistil PLC\nDon Goulding, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 203 283 4006\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\n(NOMAD)\nNeil Baldwin\nMark Brady\nTel: +44 203 368 3550\nAllenby Capital Ltd\n(Broker)\nJames Reeve/Piers Shimwell\nMatt Butlin/Jos Pinnington\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The new flavour packaging will roll out later in the year.\nCommenting on the refresh, Marketing Director, Sarah Kingsbury, said: \"This refresh has been in the background for some time, and we're excited to now be able to share this with our customers. We've stayed true to RedLeg's roots, while increasing stand-out, legibility and premium cues to create a pack which is preferred by 77% of consumers surveyed vs the previous iteration. Early performance is encouraging, and we look forward to building on this with on and off-trade marketing support over the coming year.\"\nEnquiries:\nFor further information, please contact:\nDistil PLC\nDon Goulding, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 203 283 4006\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\n(NOMAD)\nNeil Baldwin\nMark Brady\nTel: +44 203 368 3550\nAllenby Capital Ltd\n(Broker)\nJames Reeve/Piers Shimwell\nMatt Butlin/Jos Pinnington\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nAbout Reach announcements\nReach is an investor communication service aimed at assisting listed and unlisted (including AIM quoted) companies to distribute media only / non-regulatory news releases such as marketing messages, corporate and product information into the public domain.
