Following a lengthy process straddling the US government shutdown, the approval signifies that the brand can now be prepared to ship for sales in the US market.\nDistil is working with Aiko, to ensure that the process of getting product landed is as smooth as possible, and that marketing plans are in place to ensure that the brand is supported.\nDistil agrees partnership with new EU Warehousing facility\nDistil has appointed CJ Hendriks as its new warehousing and logistics partner to service customers in the EU.\nFollowing Brexit, Covid, and the war in Ukraine, import/export paperwork and logistics costs have significantly impacted small UK companies' abilities to make product available in the EU. By ensuring that a small volume of key lines in the Distil portfolio are stored in the EU, Distil will be able to provide a better, more cost-effective service to its European distribution partners, making it easier to access brands in market.\nBased near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, CJ Hendriks group is a family-owned business with over 180 years of experience in warehousing and complex logistics. The company owns 60,000m\u00b2 of warehousing in the Amsterdam port, and is located next to a container terminal. The company recently expanded its hazardous materials warehouse to 8,000m\u00b2, which is also fitted with solar panels, supplying power to 700 households.\nTo promote the benefits of the new warehousing location, Distil will be offering preferential terms to its existing export customers for a short period, as well as investing into opening new EU markets.\nArdgowan releases four new Clydebuilt blends, invests \u00a35m in Clydebuilt stocks\nArdgowan has announced four new releases in its Clydebuilt range, including three Single Cask bottlings.\nBased at the new multi-million-pound distillery in Inverclyde, Ardgowan began distilling its own malt whisky in June, but has been laying down stocks of whisky purchased on the open market since the company was formed in 2016.\nWhile its own whisky matures over the coming years, the Clydebuilt range offers the opportunity for Ardgowan to showcase its expertise in wood management and the art of blending.\nAs reported in the industry press (see\nhere\n), the company has demonstrated its continued commitment to the distillery through the investment of \u00a35 million in 2025 into maturing whisky stocks, with a further \u00a34m planned in 2026.\nIn 2021 Distil invested \u00a33m by way of a convertible loan note (\"CLN\") in Ardgowan to help fund the construction of the new whisky distillery located within the Ardgowan estate, 30 miles west of Glasgow on the banks of the River Clyde.\nThe loan currently earns Distil an annual coupon of 6.5% and, on conversion, would give Distil a 10.5% equity ownership of the overall facility.\nFurther details of the Clydebuilt releases can be found on Ardgowan's website: ardgowandistillery.com.\nEnquiries:\nFor further information, please contact:\nDistil PLC\nDon Goulding, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 203 283 4006\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\n(NOMAD)\nNeil Baldwin\nMark Brady\nTel: +44 203 368 3550\nAllenby Capital Ltd\n(Broker)\nJames Reeve/Piers Shimwell\nJos Pinnington/Guy McDougall\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nAbout Reach announcements\nReach is an investor communication service aimed at assisting listed and unlisted (including AIM quoted) companies to distribute media only / non-regulatory news releases such as marketing messages, corporate and product information into the public domain.
