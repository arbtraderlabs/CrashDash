During a challenging operating period, the Executive Directors delivered against pre-defined objectives, including stewardship of the Company through a period of operational and strategic transition and, with only limited historic awards remaining outstanding, the Board considers deferred equity to remain an important component of long-term incentive and retention arrangements. Accordingly, in recognition of this performance and to support continued alignment and retention, the Board has approved the grant of deferred share awards.\nThe following Directors were duly granted deferred share awards in the form of nil cost options over ordinary shares (\"Ordinary Shares\") on 24 December 2025. Subject to continuing office, these share awards will vest in three equal instalments on 30 June 2026, 2027 and 2028 and will remain exercisable until 24 December 2035.\nDirectors\nPosition\nNumber of Shares Awarded\nAdonis Pouroulis\nChief Executive Officer\n6,000,000\nJulian Maurice-Williams\nChief Financial Officer\n4,500,000\nDuncan Wallace\nTechnical Director\n4,500,000\nMatching awards\nIn accordance with the Company's Non-Executive Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan on 24 December 2025, Chairman Andrew Hockey was granted 434,065 matching awards over Ordinary Shares in the Company. The awards\nwere\ngranted to match the purchase of shares made by Andrew Hockey on 14 August 2024 and 19 June 2025. The matching awards are conditional upon continuing office and retention of such purchased shares until the awards vest. 76,923 matching share awards will vest in three equal instalments being immediately, 14 August 2026 and 14 August 2027 and 357,142 matching share awards will vest in three equal instalments on 19 June 2026, 2027 and 2028.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014, as retained in the UK pursuant to S3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\nEnquiries\nChariot Limited\nAdonis Pouroulis, CEO\nJulian Maurice-Williams, CFO\n+44 (0)20 7318 0450\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nomad and Joint Broker)\nDerrick Lee\n+44 (0)20 7397 8900\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nCallum Stewart, Ashton Clanfield\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7760\nCelicourt Communications\n(Financial PR)\nMark Antelme, Charles Denley-Myerson, Kathleen Beams\n+44 (0)\n20 7770 6424\nNotes\nAbout Chariot\nChariot is an Africa focused energy group with two core business streams: Upstream Oil and Gas and Renewable Power.\nChariot's Upstream Oil and Gas pillar is focused on building out a full-value chain upstream growth business within Africa.
