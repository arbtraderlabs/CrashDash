During a challenging operating period, the Executive Directors delivered against pre-defined objectives, including stewardship of the Company through a period of operational and strategic transition and, with only limited historic awards remaining outstanding, the Board considers deferred equity to remain an important component of long-term incentive and retention arrangements. Accordingly, in recognition of this performance and to support continued alignment and retention, the Board has approved the grant of deferred share awards.\nThe following Directors were duly granted deferred share awards in the form of nil cost options over ordinary shares (\"Ordinary Shares\") on 24 December 2025. Subject to continuing office, these share awards will vest in three equal instalments on 30 June 2026, 2027 and 2028 and will remain exercisable until 24 December 2035.\nDirectors\nPosition\nNumber of Shares Awarded\nAdonis Pouroulis\nChief Executive Officer\n6,000,000\nJulian Maurice-Williams\nChief Financial Officer\n4,500,000\nDuncan Wallace\nTechnical Director\n4,500,000\nMatching awards\nIn accordance with the Company's Non-Executive Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan on 24 December 2025, Chairman Andrew Hockey was granted 434,065 matching awards over Ordinary Shares in the Company. The awards\nwere\ngranted to match the purchase of shares made by Andrew Hockey on 14 August 2024 and 19 June 2025.
