          "content": "23 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 5659M\nVidendum PLC\n23 December 2025\nNOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO THE SAME WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n23 December 2025\nVidendum plc\nUpdate announcement\nVidendum plc (the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") is pleased to provide an update on its ongoing negotiations with its revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") lenders and its two largest shareholders.\nProposed Refinancing\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress with its RCF lenders and its two largest shareholders on a deleveraging plan. As outlined in the Company's 30 April 2025, 6 August 2025 and 16 October 2025 announcements, any plan to deleverage the business will require alternative new sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, any combination of proceeds from disposals, new debt facilities and the raising of new debt or equity.\nThe Group's net debt as at 30 November 2025 was \u00a3143.3 million, including \u00a326.5 million of finance leases.\nAll matters remain under consideration and subject to agreeing final, legally binding documentation, but the main components of a refinancing proposal (the \"Refinancing\") have now been agreed in-principle with the RCF lenders and the Company's two largest shareholders. The Refinancing comprises:\n\u00b7\na Firm Placing, Placing and Open Offer to raise c.\u00a370 million (gross). The two largest institutional shareholders of the Company have indicated their in-principle support to participate in this equity raise, at least pro rata on a post-Refinancing basis;\n\u00b7\nthe equitisation of c.\u00a323 million of RCF debt in exchange for new equity for Polus Capital, a private credit lender which has been one of the RCF lenders for some time;\n\u00b7\nthe repayment of c.\u00a350 million of the Group's existing RCF from the proceeds of the equity raise; and\n\u00b7\nthe restructuring of the remainder of the Group's existing RCF, including to provide the Group with sufficient maturity (three years \u00a331.5 million tranche A; two year \u00a313.5 million tranche B) and acceptable coupon and covenants, alongside the entry into a new three year Super Senior Facility underwritten by Polus Capital.\nAs a result of the Refinancing, the Group's pro forma net debt as at\n30 November 2025 would have been c.\u00a352 million, including \u00a326.5 million of finance leases, representing a reduction in net debt of more than \u00a390 million. Following the completion of the proposed Refinancing, the Company will have significantly deleveraged its capital structure, materially improved its key credit metrics and well positioned to deliver on its business potential with the support of the new Super Senior Facility and available cash on balance sheet.\nThe components noted above are inter-conditional, and the Refinancing remains subject to the finalisation of terms, credit and/or investment committee approvals and agreement of long-form documentation. Accordingly, there can be no certainty that the Refinancing will be carried out, nor as to its terms, if completed.\nThe issuance of new shares will require shareholder approvals at a general meeting. These are expected to include approval for the Company to issue new shares very significantly below their current nominal value of 20 pence per share. The Company currently expects the Refinancing to complete by the end of Q1 2026.\nWhile the Refinancing will allow for existing shareholders to participate in the equity raise, the\nCompany expects that the value attributable to existing shareholders in respect of their current shareholdings will be very significantly diluted.\nIf the Refinancing does not successfully complete, it is expected that the lending banks would pursue an alternative lender-led transaction to preserve the ability of the Group (other than the Company) to trade as a going concern. It is likely that such a transaction would result in no recovery for existing shareholders.\nStephen Harris, Executive Chairman, said,\n\"Reaching in-principle agreement on the terms of the refinancing is an important milestone for Videndum. The proposed Refinancing will help secure a stable and sustainable future for the business and position Videndum for long-term success. It will be a good outcome for Videndum, and we are grateful for the support we have received from our Shareholders and Lenders to date\"\n.\nCovenants\nThe Company has extended or had waived all relevant covenant tests since its previous update announcement on 16 October 2025.\nA further announcement will be released as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators (\"ICCs\"), professional musicians and enterprises.

Q3 revenue improved to 8% lower year-on-year (excluding the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics), after a first half decline of 25%.\nCombined with the benefits of previously announced \u00a319 million cost saving programmes coming through as expected, the Group's financial performance in 2025 is strengthening with Q3 EBITDA 50% higher than that achieved in H1. Given the limited inventory in the markets, any uptick in end market demand will feed through into revenue with little delay. Allied to previously announced management actions, any improvement in revenue will drop through to operating profit at a significant rate. Accordingly, the Board's expectations for FY26 remain unchanged.\nAs previously announced on 3 September 2025, the Company sold its consumer orientated JOBY brand to VIJIM. Gross cash proceeds will be c.\u00a35 million, of which 80% has been received, with the balance in escrow to follow within the next six months.\nNet debt as at 30 September 2025 was \u00a3139 million, including \u00a327 million of finance leases.\nOngoing negotiations with the Group's RCF lenders\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress with its lending banks on a deleveraging plan and has met its September EBITDA covenant.\nAs outlined previously in its 30 April 2025 and 6 August 2025 RNS announcements, any plan to deleverage the business will require alternative new sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, any combination of proceeds from disposals and the raising of new debt or equity.\nWhile constructive discussions regarding the deleveraging plan remain ongoing and further work is required, lenders have requested a trailing last twelve-month October EBITDA covenant of \u00a310 million in addition to the requirement to agree the deleveraging plan in October. The Company has agreed to this stretching EBITDA target with an expectation that sufficient progress will be made on the deleveraging plan such that, should trading fall short or the deleveraging plan not be agreed, lenders will waive or defer both covenants.\nA further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators (\"ICCs\"), professional musicians and enterprises.

As outlined in the Company's 30 April 2025, 6 August 2025 and 16 October 2025 announcements, any plan to deleverage the business will require alternative new sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, any combination of proceeds from disposals, new debt facilities and the raising of new debt or equity.\nThe Group's net debt as at 30 November 2025 was \u00a3143.3 million, including \u00a326.5 million of finance leases.\nAll matters remain under consideration and subject to agreeing final, legally binding documentation, but the main components of a refinancing proposal (the \"Refinancing\") have now been agreed in-principle with the RCF lenders and the Company's two largest shareholders. The Refinancing comprises:\n\u00b7\na Firm Placing, Placing and Open Offer to raise c.\u00a370 million (gross). The two largest institutional shareholders of the Company have indicated their in-principle support to participate in this equity raise, at least pro rata on a post-Refinancing basis;\n\u00b7\nthe equitisation of c.\u00a323 million of RCF debt in exchange for new equity for Polus Capital, a private credit lender which has been one of the RCF lenders for some time;\n\u00b7\nthe repayment of c.\u00a350 million of the Group's existing RCF from the proceeds of the equity raise; and\n\u00b7\nthe restructuring of the remainder of the Group's existing RCF, including to provide the Group with sufficient maturity (three years \u00a331.5 million tranche A; two year \u00a313.5 million tranche B) and acceptable coupon and covenants, alongside the entry into a new three year Super Senior Facility underwritten by Polus Capital.\nAs a result of the Refinancing, the Group's pro forma net debt as at\n30 November 2025 would have been c.\u00a352 million, including \u00a326.5 million of finance leases, representing a reduction in net debt of more than \u00a390 million. Following the completion of the proposed Refinancing, the Company will have significantly deleveraged its capital structure, materially improved its key credit metrics and well positioned to deliver on its business potential with the support of the new Super Senior Facility and available cash on balance sheet.\nThe components noted above are inter-conditional, and the Refinancing remains subject to the finalisation of terms, credit and/or investment committee approvals and agreement of long-form documentation. Accordingly, there can be no certainty that the Refinancing will be carried out, nor as to its terms, if completed.\nThe issuance of new shares will require shareholder approvals at a general meeting. These are expected to include approval for the Company to issue new shares very significantly below their current nominal value of 20 pence per share. The Company currently expects the Refinancing to complete by the end of Q1 2026.\nWhile the Refinancing will allow for existing shareholders to participate in the equity raise, the\nCompany expects that the value attributable to existing shareholders in respect of their current shareholdings will be very significantly diluted.\nIf the Refinancing does not successfully complete, it is expected that the lending banks would pursue an alternative lender-led transaction to preserve the ability of the Group (other than the Company) to trade as a going concern. It is likely that such a transaction would result in no recovery for existing shareholders.\nStephen Harris, Executive Chairman, said,\n\"Reaching in-principle agreement on the terms of the refinancing is an important milestone for Videndum. The proposed Refinancing will help secure a stable and sustainable future for the business and position Videndum for long-term success. It will be a good outcome for Videndum, and we are grateful for the support we have received from our Shareholders and Lenders to date\"\n.\nCovenants\nThe Company has extended or had waived all relevant covenant tests since its previous update announcement on 16 October 2025.\nA further announcement will be released as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broad",

Q3 revenue improved to 8% lower year-on-year (excluding the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics), after a first half decline of 25%.\nCombined with the benefits of previously announced \u00a319 million cost saving programmes coming through as expected, the Group's financial performance in 2025 is strengthening with Q3 EBITDA 50% higher than that achieved in H1. Given the limited inventory in the markets, any uptick in end market demand will feed through into revenue with little delay. Allied to previously announced management actions, any improvement in revenue will drop through to operating profit at a significant rate. Accordingly, the Board's expectations for FY26 remain unchanged.\nAs previously announced on 3 September 2025, the Company sold its consumer orientated JOBY brand to VIJIM. Gross cash proceeds will be c.\u00a35 million, of which 80% has been received, with the balance in escrow to follow within the next six months.\nNet debt as at 30 September 2025 was \u00a3139 million, including \u00a327 million of finance leases.\nOngoing negotiations with the Group's RCF lenders\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress with its lending banks on a deleveraging plan and has met its September EBITDA covenant.\nAs outlined previously in its 30 April 2025 and 6 August 2025 RNS announcements, any plan to deleverage the business will require alternative new sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, any combination of proceeds from disposals and the raising of new debt or equity.\nWhile constructive discussions regarding the deleveraging plan remain ongoing and further work is required, lenders have requested a trailing last twelve-month October EBITDA covenant of \u00a310 million in addition to the requirement to agree the deleveraging plan in October. The Company has agreed to this stretching EBITDA target with an expectation that sufficient progress will be made on the deleveraging plan such that, should trading fall short or the deleveraging plan not be agreed, lenders will waive or defer both covenants.\nA further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators (\"ICCs\"), professional musicians and enterprises.

However, much of the adjusted operating profit impact caused by the revenue shortfall was offset by the restructuring and cost management programmes previously announced.\n\"\nWhilst conditions improved month by month through Q1 2025, the ramifications of the United States (\n\"\nUS\n\"\n) trade policies have become clearer during Q2 2025. End user demand in the US is running ahead of sales to Videndum\n'\ns distribution channels, as importers have been holding off ordering until the tariff situation becomes clearer. This has led to weaker revenues in the United States. Ongoing global macro-economic uncertainty, as well as tariff uncertainty, have also had some impact on revenues outside the US.\n\"However,\nend customer sentiment is turning in the independent content creators (\n\"\nICC\n\"\n) market and there are increasing signs of pent-up demand in the Cine market. This, in conjunction with the trading environment outlined above, has led to there being a limited amount of inventory in the US. The Group has put in place stocks of long lead time components to ensure it can respond quickly to any increased demand. Consequently, any uptick in end market demand will feed through into revenue with little delay. Allied to the benefit from the restructuring and cost management programmes previously announced, any improvement in revenue in H2 2025 will drop through to operating profit at a significant rate.\n\"\nThe ongoing uncertain economic environment and the increased trading volatility due to US tariffs has led to a deterioration in the Group\n'\ns visibility of the potential outcome for FY25.\nNotes\n1\nAmimon was sold on 9 April 2025 and is reported as a discontinued operation. Results of discontinued operations can be found in notes 2 and 14 to the condensed financial statements. Amimon was not treated as a discontinued operation at FY 2024 results; H2 2024 revenue above has been restated to treat Amimon as a discontinued operation in FY 2024.\n2\nH2 2024 adjusted operating loss was \u00a310.9 million when excluding \u00a318.3 million of one-off charges. These non-cash items predominantly related to one-off inventory provision charges and the write-off of intangible assets.\n3\nH1 2025 average exchange rates: \u00a31 = USD 1.30, \u00a31 = EUR 1.19, EUR 1 = USD 1.09, \u00a31 = JPY 193\n4\nH1 2024 average exchange rates: \u00a31 = USD 1.26, \u00a31 = EUR 1.17, EUR 1 = USD 1.08, \u00a31 = JPY 192\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of Videndum plc is Jon Bolton, Group Company Secretary.\n* In additi",

The Placing and the Director Subscriptions successfully raised gross proceeds of approximately \u00a38 million (before expenses and fees). The Placing was oversubscribed with support from Videndum's existing shareholders.\nThe Placing Price represents a 24.3 per cent. premium to the closing price on 29 April 2025 (being the last practicable day prior to the date of this Announcement). The Placing Shares and the Director Subscription Shares being issued represent approximately 9.99 per cent of the existing issued ordinary share capital of Videndum on the date of this Announcement.\nApplications have been made (i) to the Financial Conduct Authority (the \"\nFCA\n\") for admission of the Placing Shares and the Director Subscription Shares to the equity shares (commercial companies) category of the Official List; and (ii) to London Stock Exchange plc for admission of the Placing Shares to trading on its main market for listed securities (together, \"\nAdmission\n\").

There are no shares held in treasury therefore, following Admission, the total number of shares with voting rights in the Company is 103,613,404 ordinary shares of 20 pence each.

FURTHER, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT AN OFFER OF SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.\nFor immediate release\n30 April 2025\nVidendum plc\n(\"Videndum\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nProposed Equity Raise to issue 9,412,663 New Shares for gross proceeds of c.\u00a3\n8\nmillion\nVidendum, the international\nprovider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market\n, announces the launch of a fully underwritten non-pre-emptive placing of new ordinary shares (the \"\nPlacing Shares\n\") of 20 pence each in the capital of the Company (the \"\nPlacing\n\"). The Placing Price is 85 pence per share, representing a 24.3 per cent. premium to the closing price on\u00a029 April 2025 (being the last practicable day prior to the date of this announcement). The gross proceeds (before expenses and fees) from the Equity Raise will amount to approximately \u00a38 million and the New Shares represent c.9.99% of the issued share capital of the Company on the date of this announcement.\nThe Placing satisfies the requests of its debt lenders for increased liquidity and is a condition to the Covenant Reset, provides increased balance sheet flexibility and enables the Company to continue to deliver on the restructuring initiatives highlighted in previous announcements as part of its ongoing operational efficiency programme.\nWhilst macroeconomic conditions remain challenging, we continue to simplify our organisational structure and implement structural cost initiatives\nexpected to deliver annualised cost savings of \u00a318 million with a \u00a315 million benefit in 2025\n. We have already executed many of these initiatives and the Placing allows the Company to progress other restructuring opportunities earlier, such\nas the closure of our manufacturing operations in Bury St Edmunds, UK, moving these to our existing sites in Feltre, Italy and Cartago, Costa Rica.\nVidendum also continues to work with its lenders, who remain supportive of the Company and have provided further contingent debt amendments as detailed in our separate FY24 Results announcement. We have commenced discussions with new and existing lenders to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility, which is set to expire in August 2026. The Company is considering traditional lending banks and private credit providers. If successful, this will help to provide the Company with a debt platform from which it can build a stronger business, focus on delivering growth and create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nThe Company continues to monitor its capital structure to ensure it is appropriately financed and is also considering a number of other possible financing options as part of its ongoing restructuring initiatives, including the possibility of raising further new equity if the Board considers it appropriate to do so, alongside the ongoing discussions around the potential refinancing of its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company is also considering certain disposals as described in the FY24 Results announcement and may explore further disposals if the Board considers it appropriate to do so.\nThe Board's unanimous view is that the Placing is in the best interests of shareholders and wider stakeholders and will promote the success of the Company. In conjunction with the Placing, certain directors of the Company also intend to subscribe for new ordinary shares of 20 pence each in the capital of the Company (the \"\nDirector Subscription Shares\n\") at the Placing Price (the \"\nDirector Subscriptions\n\"). The total contributed by directors of the Company in the Director Subscriptions is expected to be an aggregate amount of approximately \u00a370,000. The Director Subscriptions will be on the basis agreed pursuant to subscription letters with the Company, rather than pursuant to the terms and conditions in Appendix 1 to this announcement. The Board's unanimous view is that the Director Subscriptions are also in the best interests of shareholders and wider stakeholders and will promote the success of the Company.\nThe Placing will be conducted through an accelerated bookbuilding process (the \"\nBookbuild\n\") which will be launched immediately following this announcement and is subject to the terms and conditions set out in Appendix 1 to this announcement (such announcement and its Appendices together being this \"\nAnnouncement\n\").\n2024 Financial Year Results and Covenant Reset\nVidendum has separately today announced its audited results for the year en",

H2 2025 is expected to be stronger due to the normalisation of content creation markets and reductions in channel overstocking created in 2024, with FY 2025 revenues flat compared to 2024.\n\"\nThe issue of tariffs is fast moving and has potential ramifications across some 50% of the business. Our approach is to carefully monitor the developments in this area, and Videndum will rely on its strong position in the markets in which it operates to implement price increases as necessary to pass on the additional cost of tariffs. The Group should enjoy an advantage relative to the vast majority of its competition, which are Chinese. However, the main 2nd order risk we see is a global recession that would impact demand for our products.\n\"\nAdjusted operating profit margins* are expected to improve to low-single-digit levels, benefiting from the extensive restructuring activities announced so far, most of which are now complete, and which will have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2025.\n\"\nIn 2026 and beyond, revenues will benefit from both a return to market growth and a resumption of new product introductions. Longer-term expectations for the business are to achieve mid-double-digit adjusted operating profit margins* from a combination of operating leverage on revenue growth, structural simplification and continued focus on operational efficiencies.\n\"\nWith our premium products, market-leading brands and improving cost base, the Board is confident that the Group is well positioned for the future.\n\"\nNotes\n1\nAmimon was held for sale at 31 December 2023 and reported as discontinued operations, however reclassified to continuing operations for 2024. Discontinued operations also includes the operation at Syrp (the Media Solutions\n'\nmotion controls R&D centre in New Zealand), which was wound down in H2 202",

Discussions with our lending banks regarding the March 2025 covenant and continued access to the Group's Revolving Credit Facility are ongoing. As outlined previously, an amendment or waiver of the March 2025 covenant will be required as the performance in H2 FY24 was weaker than that anticipated in the H1 FY24 results announcement. As a result, the March 2025 covenant which factors in the last 12 months performance will not be met.\nThe work required to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility, set to expire in August 2026, continues and our lending banks remain supportive of the Company.\nSince our last update, we have commenced additional restructuring initiatives including the planned transfer of manufacturing operations from Bury St Edmunds to Feltre, in Italy. This is part of our ongoing operational efficiency programme, which is continuing at pace, with employee and union agreements necessary to deliver the planned savings now in place.\nAs a result of the additional initiatives, we have increased our 2025 cost-saving target of \u00a315 million, from \u00a310 million previously.\u00a0These costs are primarily structural in nature and not expected to return as volumes rise. The associated cash restructuring costs related to announced initiatives is now expected to be c.\u00a315 million, of which \u00a33 million was incurred in FY24.\u00a0The measures we are taking are positioning Videndum for a strong recovery and expanding margins.\nStephen Harris, Executive Chairman commented:\n\"The gradual improvement in our markets has continued. We are seeing improving signs, particularly in Cine and Broadcast, in terms of quantity and quality of projects and enquiries. These should start turning into stronger order momentum once we get past the traditional doldrums of January and early February. While we are not planning on a strong uptick in orders and revenues as we drive the business forward, we are gaining increasing confidence that the direction of travel is for improved strength in revenues as we move through the year.\n\"There is still work to do, but I am confident that we are on the right path - building a stronger business, well positioned to capitalise on the market recovery\".\nEnquiries\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the growing content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators, gamers, professional musicians and enterprises.

This programme is centred on four key areas:\n1. reinstating pricing discipline;\n2. improving operational efficiency;\n3. driving gross margin expansion; and\n4. reducing discretionary spend\nAs part of this initiative, we are simplifying our organisational structure, moving from three Divisions to two: Videndum Production and Imaging (\"VPI\") focusing on our broadcast and imaging segments, and Videndum Creative Solutions (\"VCS\") serving the cine and audio markets.\nEarlier this year we announced a \u00a310 million strategic cost-saving programme. So far, we are 80% through implementation and expect to realise the full amount of savings in FY25. There will be minimal savings realised in FY24. The Group continues to evaluate further cost saving opportunities.\nExpected Outturn for FY24\nRevenue is expected to be c.\u00a3280 million;\nAn exceptional charge of c.\u00a325 million is anticipated against Adjusted Continuing Operating Profit. Before this non-cash write-off of predominately stock and intangibles, together with reclassification of previously discontinued operations, the Group is expected to break-even;\nAdjusting items will include a charge of c.\u00a310 million for cash restructuring costs related to announced initiatives, of which c.\u00a33 million will be paid in FY24 and the balance in FY25; and\nNet debt is expected to be c.\u00a3135 million including c.\u00a330 million of lease liabilities.\nUpdate on December covenant\nOur lending banks remain supportive of the business and have amended our December 2024 covenants to an interest cover of no less than 1.25 times EBITA and leverage to no more than 5.5 times EBITDA. The end of March 2025 covenant thresholds will also now apply to the end of February 2025.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility is set to expire in August 2026. We are actively working with our lending banks to secure an extension or a refinancing during H1 2025, in addition to addressing necessary amendments to the February and March 2025 covenants. An update will be provided in Q1 2025.\nStephen Harris, Executive Chairman commented:\n\"Since assuming my expanded role, I have seen significant opportunities within the business. However, it has to be recognised that there are areas where management processes, cost discipline, and contractual and commercial acumen require strengthening. These challenges were exacerbated in some areas by challenging market conditions. The new management team has identified the issues and is addressing them at pace.\n\"We fully anticipate market conditions to improve, and we are seeing some signs of gradual improvement which we believe will benefit trading in H1 FY25. In the meantime, we are focusing on what we can control - expanding our operational efficiency programme and adopting a relentless focus on cost.\n\"Videndum has strong market positions and remains well positioned in attractive markets with good medium-term prospects. This management team is committed to creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\"\nEnquiries\nFTI Consulting\nSusanne Yule/ Richard Mountain\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the growing content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators, gamers, professional musicians and enterprises.

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away... A real shame to see this company in this state.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away... A real shame to see this company in this state.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away... A real shame to see this company in this state.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose.

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose.

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away... A real shame to see this company in this state.",

Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away... A real shame to see this company in this state.",

Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access. Doesnt look good",

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...

          "content": "In order to assess future covenants and future liquidity needs of the Group the Board has conducted a thorough evaluation of the going concern assumption and has modelled a number of scenarios. Given the trailing nature of a LTM covenant, most of the September 2025 LTM EBITDA is known and it is probable that the covenant will not be achieved or achieved with minimal headroom, which could lead to an event of default when reported in mid-October 2025 unless waived or amended. In all scenarios other than in those where a strong market recovery occurs, the leverage and interest cover covenants will be breached from December 2025 onwards. Future liquidity needs will be dependent on trading and on the success, timing and use of proceeds from deleveraging actions that will require negotiation with lenders. Notwithstanding, the liquidity impact from deleveraging actions, the Group is at risk of requiring greater liquidity than that afforded by the RCF cap. In all but the downside scenarios, the additional liquidity requirement would be within the \u00a311 million headroom between the liquidity cap and maximum borrowings under the RCF but would require lender consent to access.

Although I kind of contradicted myself saying a gamble is a gamble having previously used the term 'outright gamble'  that 's because Wood is in suspension and the risk is there of getting nothing back whereas here yes you can still walk away with something if it continues to fall but I still say it's all gambling. On Wood, I really don't know Laura, It sits as at a complete 50/50 for me although some news recently seems a little more positive but like I've said it could turn in a moment for the worst and I'm fortunate not to worry unlike some invested over there, If I lose I lose. I do have a reasonable five figure some gambled on it.",

I think their nomad is Investec who are not mugs - although tbf their name is not on the RNS so maybe they are not running the raise? The good news (for the company and mgmt, but not for current shareholders) is they have most of this secured. \u00a323m of it is conversion of debt to equity from one of their big lenders (in effect the same as raising new money and using it to pay down debt). Then of the \u00a370m remaining, their top two shareholders have committed to at least follow their money ie 45%  of \u00a370m is covered, ie c.\u00a332m, so 'only' \u00a338m left to find... I suspect some other institutions will also at least follow their money. I think they will get the raise away, just, but the key thing will be at what valuation? I think the current equity is virtually worthless sadly, as per my previous post. A sad situation for a company that was once a successful thriving business.",

My back if envelope is if they do placing at 10p, post raise it will have about 1bn shares (100m currently plus 900m more to raise 90m gbp at 10p), ie at 10p will have 100m mcap, and c.30m net debt so 130m EV. IF they get ebit to 13-14m (big if for me) it's will be trading at 9-10x ev/ebit. Which is not cheap and still has risk. Suggests maybe placing at less than 10p which pretty much wipes out existing shareholders. Aldi suggests it's not a dead cert that they get the placing away...
