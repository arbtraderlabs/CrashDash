          "content": "23 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 5659M\nVidendum PLC\n23 December 2025\nNOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO THE SAME WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n23 December 2025\nVidendum plc\nUpdate announcement\nVidendum plc (the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") is pleased to provide an update on its ongoing negotiations with its revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") lenders and its two largest shareholders.\nProposed Refinancing\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress with its RCF lenders and its two largest shareholders on a deleveraging plan. As outlined in the Company's 30 April 2025, 6 August 2025 and 16 October 2025 announcements, any plan to deleverage the business will require alternative new sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, any combination of proceeds from disposals, new debt facilities and the raising of new debt or equity.\nThe Group's net debt as at 30 November 2025 was \u00a3143.3 million, including \u00a326.5 million of finance leases.\nAll matters remain under consideration and subject to agreeing final, legally binding documentation, but the main components of a refinancing proposal (the \"Refinancing\") have now been agreed in-principle with the RCF lenders and the Company's two largest shareholders. The Refinancing comprises:\n\u00b7\na Firm Placing, Placing and Open Offer to raise c.\u00a370 million (gross). The two largest institutional shareholders of the Company have indicated their in-principle support to participate in this equity raise, at least pro rata on a post-Refinancing basis;\n\u00b7\nthe equitisation of c.\u00a323 million of RCF debt in exchange for new equity for Polus Capital, a private credit lender which has been one of the RCF lenders for some time;\n\u00b7\nthe repayment of c.\u00a350 million of the Group's existing RCF from the proceeds of the equity raise; and\n\u00b7\nthe restructuring of the remainder of the Group's existing RCF, including to provide the Group with sufficient maturity (three years \u00a331.5 million tranche A; two year \u00a313.5 million tranche B) and acceptable coupon and covenants, alongside the entry into a new three year Super Senior Facility underwritten by Polus Capital.\nAs a result of the Refinancing, the Group's pro forma net debt as at\n30 November 2025 would have been c.\u00a352 million, including \u00a326.5 million of finance leases, representing a reduction in net debt of more than \u00a390 million. Following the completion of the proposed Refinancing, the Company will have significantly deleveraged its capital structure, materially improved its key credit metrics and well positioned to deliver on its business potential with the support of the new Super Senior Facility and available cash on balance sheet.\nThe components noted above are inter-conditional, and the Refinancing remains subject to the finalisation of terms, credit and/or investment committee approvals and agreement of long-form documentation. Accordingly, there can be no certainty that the Refinancing will be carried out, nor as to its terms, if completed.\nThe issuance of new shares will require shareholder approvals at a general meeting. These are expected to include approval for the Company to issue new shares very significantly below their current nominal value of 20 pence per share. The Company currently expects the Refinancing to complete by the end of Q1 2026.\nWhile the Refinancing will allow for existing shareholders to participate in the equity raise, the\nCompany expects that the value attributable to existing shareholders in respect of their current shareholdings will be very significantly diluted.\nIf the Refinancing does not successfully complete, it is expected that the lending banks would pursue an alternative lender-led transaction to preserve the ability of the Group (other than the Company) to trade as a going concern. It is likely that such a transaction would result in no recovery for existing shareholders.\nStephen Harris, Executive Chairman, said,\n\"Reaching in-principle agreement on the terms of the refinancing is an important milestone for Videndum. The proposed Refinancing will help secure a stable and sustainable future for the business and position Videndum for long-term success. It will be a good outcome for Videndum, and we are grateful for the support we have received from our Shareholders and Lenders to date\"\n.\nCovenants\nThe Company has extended or had waived all relevant covenant tests since its previous update announcement on 16 October 2025.\nA further announcement will be released as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators (\"ICCs\"), professional musicians and enterprises.

Q3 revenue improved to 8% lower year-on-year (excluding the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics), after a first half decline of 25%.\nCombined with the benefits of previously announced \u00a319 million cost saving programmes coming through as expected, the Group's financial performance in 2025 is strengthening with Q3 EBITDA 50% higher than that achieved in H1. Given the limited inventory in the markets, any uptick in end market demand will feed through into revenue with little delay. Allied to previously announced management actions, any improvement in revenue will drop through to operating profit at a significant rate. Accordingly, the Board's expectations for FY26 remain unchanged.\nAs previously announced on 3 September 2025, the Company sold its consumer orientated JOBY brand to VIJIM. Gross cash proceeds will be c.\u00a35 million, of which 80% has been received, with the balance in escrow to follow within the next six months.\nNet debt as at 30 September 2025 was \u00a3139 million, including \u00a327 million of finance leases.\nOngoing negotiations with the Group's RCF lenders\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress with its lending banks on a deleveraging plan and has met its September EBITDA covenant.\nAs outlined previously in its 30 April 2025 and 6 August 2025 RNS announcements, any plan to deleverage the business will require alternative new sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, any combination of proceeds from disposals and the raising of new debt or equity.\nWhile constructive discussions regarding the deleveraging plan remain ongoing and further work is required, lenders have requested a trailing last twelve-month October EBITDA covenant of \u00a310 million in addition to the requirement to agree the deleveraging plan in October. The Company has agreed to this stretching EBITDA target with an expectation that sufficient progress will be made on the deleveraging plan such that, should trading fall short or the deleveraging plan not be agreed, lenders will waive or defer both covenants.\nA further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries\nFTI Consulting\nRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher\nTelephone: 020 3272 1340\nVidendum\nStephen Harris\nGroup Executive Chairman\nTelephone: 020 8332 4602\nA snapshot of Videndum plc\nVidendum is a leading global provider of premium branded hardware products and software solutions to the content creation market.\nVidendum's customers include broadcasters, film studios, production and rental companies, photographers, independent content creators (\"ICCs\"), professional musicians and enterprises.
