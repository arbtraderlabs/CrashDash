The NSTA is the UK regulator focused, among other areas, on oil and gas exploration and production activities in the UK's North Sea.\nOn 18 December 2025, Deltic announced that it had been informed that Viaro Bidco had requested, and the NSTA had agreed to, an extension to the date by which the NSTA requires further representations from Viaro Bidco in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic and that the NSTA had agreed that this information should be provided to it by 30 January 2026. Deltic has since been informed that Viaro Bidco has requested, and the NSTA has agreed to, a further extension to the date for providing these representations until 13 February 2026.\nA further announcement will be made in due course.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement (the \"\nAnnouncement\n\") shall, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the Scheme Document published on 25 July 2025.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the Offer Period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Takeover Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1 per cent. or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.\nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).\nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the Offer Period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.\nElectronic Communications\nPlease be aware that addresses, electronic addresses and certain other information provided by Deltic Shareholders, persons with information rights and other relevant persons for the receipt of communications from Deltic may be provided to Viaro Bidco during the Offer Period as required under Section 4 of Appendix 4 to the Takeover Code to comply with Rule 2.11(c) of the Takeover Code.\nOverseas jurisdictions\nThe release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom, and the availability of the Acquisition to Deltic Shareholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom, may be restricted by the laws of those jurisdictions and therefore persons into whose possession this Announcement comes should inform themselves about and observe such restrictions. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Deltic Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to execute and deliver forms of proxy appointing another to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Further details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained in the Scheme Document (or, if the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, the offer document). Any failure to comply with any such restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person.\nUnless otherwise determined by Viaro Bidco or required by the Takeover Code, and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Acquisition will not be made available, directly or indirectly, in, into or from a Restricted Jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this Announcement and all documents relating to the Acquisition are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from a Restricted Jurisdiction, and persons receiving this Announcement and all documents relating to the Acquisition (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise distribute or send them in, into or from such Restricted Jurisdiction. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation), the Takeover Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by use of mails or any other means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Takeover Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or from within any Restricted Jurisdiction.\nThis Announcement has been prepared in connection with proposals in relation to a scheme of arrangement pursuant to and for the purpose of complying with English law and the Takeover Code and information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this Announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom. Nothing in this Announcement should be relied on for any other purpose.\nThe Acquisition shall be subject to the applicable requirements of the Takeover Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange, the FCA and the AIM Rules.\nAdditional information for U.S. investors\nThe Acquisition relates to the shares of an English company and is being made by means of a scheme of arrangement provided for under English company law. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer or proxy solicitation rules under the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Acquisition is subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes of arrangement which differ from the disclosure requirements of the US tender offer and proxy solicitation rules.\nIf, in the future, Viaro Bidco exercises its right to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer, which is to be made into the US, such Takeover Offer will be made in compliance with the applicable US laws and regulations, including Section 14(e) and Regulation 14E under the US Exchange Act. Such a Takeover Offer would be made in the US by Viaro Bidco and no one else.\nIn accordance with normal United Kingdom practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, Viaro Bidco, its affiliates, their advisers and the nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Deltic outside the Acquisition, such as in open market purchases or privately negotiated purchases, during the period in which the Acquisition remains open for acceptance. If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made, they would comply with applicable law, including UK laws and the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase shall be disclosed as required under UK laws and will be available to all investors (including US investors) via the Regulatory Information Service and shall be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is required to be publicly disclosed in the UK in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, this information will, as applicable, also be publicly disclosed in the United States.\nIt may be difficult for US holders of Deltic Shares to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws in connection with the Acquisition, since Viaro Bidco and Deltic are located in non-US jurisdictions, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of non-US jurisdictions. US holders of Deltic Shares may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgement.\nNeither the Acquisition nor this Announcement have been approved or disapproved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission in the United States or any other US regulatory authority, nor have such authorities approved or disapproved or passed judgement upon the fairness or the merits of the Acquisition, or determined if the information contained in this Announcement is adequate, accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by a US holder as consideration for the transfer of its Deltic Shares pursuant to the Acquisition will likely be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes and under applicable US state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each US holder of Deltic Shares is urged to consult their independent legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to them, including under applicable US state and local, as well as overseas and other, tax laws.\nForward-looking statements\nThis Announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by Viaro Bidco or Deltic may contain statements about Viaro Bidco and Deltic that are or may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Announcement may be forward-looking statements. Without limitation, any statements preceded or followed by or that include the words \"targets\", \"plans\", \"believes\", \"expects\", \"aims\", \"intends\", \"will\", \"may\", \"shall\", \"should\", \"anticipates\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"is subject to\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"forecast\" or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Viaro Bidco's or Deltic's operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; and (iii) the effects of government regulation on Viaro Bidco's or Deltic's business.\nSuch forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of Viaro Bidco and Deltic about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results and are based on certain key assumptions. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking statements, including: changes in the global, political, social, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates, future business combinations or disposals, changes in the behaviour of market participants, the speculative nature of oil and gas exploration, fluctuations in demand and pricing in the oil and gas exploration industry and risks and hazards associated with the business of oil and gas exploration. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in light of such factors. Neither Viaro Bidco nor Deltic, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this Announcement will actually occur. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to any member of the Viaro Group or the Deltic Group, or any of their respective associates, directors, officers, employees or advisers, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above.\nViaro Bidco and Deltic expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking or other statements contained herein, except as required by applicable law or by the rules of any competent regulatory authority, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nPublication on a website\nA copy of this Announcement will be available, free of charge, subject to certain restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Viaro Bidco's website at https://viaro.co.uk/disclaimer/ and Deltic's website at https://delticenergy.com/disclaimer/ by no later than 12.00 noon (London Time) on the Business Day following the publication of this Announcement.\nGeneral\nIf you are in any doubt about the contents of this Announcement or the action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own independent financial advice immediately from your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor or independent financial adviser duly authorised under FSMA if you are resident in the United Kingdom or, if not, from another appropriately authorised independent financial adviser.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Deferred Repayment Agreement is unsecured and contains customary representations, warranties, undertakings and events of default. The Deferred Repayment Agreement also contains provisions whereby Shell will be entitled to require early repayment of the Deferred Amounts 30 days following a change of control of Deltic; and also where Shell will be entitled to declare the Deferred Amounts repayable upon Deltic performing an assignment of its interest in Selene.\nDeltic has drawn down the full \u00a32.7 million available to it under the bridging facility provided by RockRose Energy Limited as part of the proposed all cash acquisition of Deltic Energy Plc. As of 30 November 2025 Deltic had unaudited cash of \u00a31.90 million and, as a result of securing the Deferred Payment Agreement, is funded for working capital purposes until at least mid-2026.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please contact the following:\nDeltic Energy Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7887 2630\nAndrew Nunn / Sarah McLeod\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart / Alex Brearley (Corporate Finance)\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7523 8000\nAdam James\nVigo Consulting (IR Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7390 0230\nPatrick d'Ancona\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The NSTA is the UK regulator focused, among other areas, on oil and gas exploration and production activities in the UK's North Sea.\nDeltic has been informed by the NSTA that it requires further representations from Viaro Bidco and Deltic in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic. The NSTA has requested this information be provided to it by 22 December 2025.\nIn light of this delay, Deltic and Viaro Bidco have agreed to extend the long stop date by which the Scheme must complete from 31 December 2025 to 31 March 2026.\nThe Board of Deltic remains of the opinion that the Acquisition remains in the best interests of Deltic Shareholders and wider stakeholders and is disappointed with the continuing delays in the regulatory process.\nA further announcement will be made in due course.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement (the \"\nAnnouncement\n\") shall, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the Scheme Document published on 25 July 2025.

The NSTA is the UK regulator focused, among other areas, on oil and gas exploration and production activities in the UK's North Sea.\nDeltic provided notice of the proposed change in control to the NSTA on 1 July 2025 and the NSTA confirmed it had received the information required to proceed with the consultation from Viaro Bidco on 9 July 2025. Guidance published by the NSTA states that, as a general rule, a decision in relation to a change in control will be provided within three months of an application. However, Viaro Bidco and Deltic have recently received correspondence from the NSTA which indicates that, whilst the NSTA is looking to complete the assessment as soon as practicable, this assessment process is taking longer than the guidance published by the NSTA and is now unlikely to be completed before the end of November.\nViaro Bidco and Deltic remain optimistic that completion of the Acquisition will occur in Q4 2025, and a further announcement will be made as appropriate.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement (the \"\nAnnouncement\n\") shall, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the Scheme Document published on 25 July 2025.

We aimed to be part of the transition maximising domestic production and minimising imports.\nUnfortunately, while assessing subsurface risk in our prospect work, we underestimated the impact of the risk that undermined our business plan. Hostile policy across several governments reduced investor confidence and cut off the supply of licences and capital.\nOn 30 June 2025, the boards of Rockrose Energy Limited (\"Viaro Bidco\") a wholly owned subsidiary of Viaro Energy Limited (\"Viaro Energy\") and Deltic announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer for the entire issued share capital of Deltic (the \"Acquisition\"). Recommending the sale of the Company to an organisation with a different business model and greater financial capacity was the obvious solution and that's where we stand today.\nWe are very proud of our achievements to date and will watch closely as the Selene and Pensacola discoveries are matured and hopefully taken into production, producing much needed natural gas for the benefit of the UK.\nMark Lappin\nChairman\n24 September 2025\nCEO Statement\nThe uncertainty surrounding the UK Government's policy position continues to damage the UK's domestic E&P industry and undermine investor confidence in the sector as we continue to wait on the outcome of ongoing consultations in relation to the future of licensing on the UK Continental Shelf and the fiscal regime.\nDuring the first half of 2025, it became clear that Deltic's exploration focussed strategy, which relied on access to further equity capital to drive the progression of assets up the value chain through farm-out, discovery and ultimately development, was no longer sustainable in the current business environment.\nIt was against this backdrop that the Deltic Board welcomed the proposed Acquisition of Deltic by Viaro Bidco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Viaro Energy. The Acquisition provides a way forward for the Selene asset, giving our licence partners and regulators some certainty around the future of that asset and the rest of the Deltic portfolio.\nAt the Court Meeting held on 28 August 2025, Deltic shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the acquisition of Deltic by Viaro Bidco. Transaction completion, which is still subject to certain regulatory consents, is currently expected in early Q4 of 2025, after which the shares of Deltic Energy Plc will be cancelled from trading on AIM.\nDeltic has consistently punched above its weight and has achieved more than any other small explorer over the same period as evidenced by the farm-outs to Shell, and others, and a 100% drilling success rate which delivered two major gas discoveries in the Southern North Sea. I'm immensely proud of what we've managed to achieve at Deltic, and Cluff Natural Resources before that, and would like to thank all those that have supported the business over the years as well of course as the Deltic team which has worked so hard to progress our strategy.\nAndrew Nunn\nChief Executive Officer\n24 September 2025\nO\npe\nr\na\nt\ni\nn\ng Re\nvi\ne\nw\nDuring the period the team has continued to support Shell UK Ltd, in its role as Operator of Licence P2437, containin",

Selene also has a straightforward route to market, via the Norwich Bacton plant which has capacity to receive and process gas just like this and has been doing so since it was opened by the late Prince Philip in 1969. The operator of the Selene field is the operator of the gas processing plant, and this symmetry has been part of the Deltic plan since it was awarded the licence and performed the initial farm down of its interest to the current operator.\nIn contrast to continued exploration success, political hostility towards our sector continues. Both the previous UK Government and the new government applied political expediency and populism as well as ideology to create or amplify a negative attitude towards UK oil and gas from NGO and investor communities.\nBut this is strange when you consider that, fundamentally, all parties including the committee on climate change and leaders in government accept the need for continued supply of gas, and, while we accept that demand will fall in the coming years, it is clear that domestic gas demand forecasts greatly exceed forecasts of production. Meeting that demand by increasing imported supplies does not make sense for the desired economic growth we hear so much about, nor from an environmental perspective given imports' much greater emissions. There are clear signs of the government understanding this and the direction of travel appears more positive or at least less negative. The current government has offered repeated assurances of support for existing assets and licences, but the industry must work hard to ensure the pace is consistent with its development goals.\nOther assets will be covered in the rest of this report but hopefully this provides a high-level glimpse of the highs and lows of the last 12 months. I would like to thank all Deltic staff for their ongoing efforts last year and also our shareholders for their continued patience and support.\nOur exploration success rate has been two out of two wells. This is an outstanding record and testimony to one of our fundamental business principles of thorough technical work by experts in this area. The eventual outcome for our first drilling success at Pensacola, in large part a function of timing in relation to the requirements for investment, alongside external, predominantly politically driven factors, continues to be a painful experience as it would be for any explorer that first identified an opportunity that had been overlooked.\nOver the last 12-18 months, the Company has faced a common dilemma that an exploration company can have, which is finding the funds to turn exploration success into value in what continues to be a very difficult market for attracting equity funding, particularly for UK-focused companies given recent political uncertainties, and a sluggish farm-out market.\nIt is in this context that, on 30 June 2025, the boards of Rockrose Energy Limited (\"Viaro Bidco\") a wholly-owned subsidiary of Viaro Energy Limited (\"Viaro Energy\") and Deltic announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer for the entire issued share capital of Deltic (the \"Acquisition\").

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n30 June 2025\nRECOMMENDED CASH ACQUISITION OF\nDELTIC ENERGY PLC (\"Deltic\" or the \"Company\")\nBY\nROCKROSE ENERGY LIMITED (\"Viaro Bidco\")\n(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF VIARO ENERGY LIMITED (\"Viaro Energy\" or \"Viaro\"))\nto be effected by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006\nSummary\n\u00b7\nThe boards of Viaro Bidco and Deltic are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Deltic (the\n\"Acquisition\"\n). It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act.\n\u00b7\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition, each Deltic Shareholder will be entitled to receive:\nFor each Deltic Share: 7.46 pence in cash(the\n\"Cash Consideration\"\n)\n\u00b7\nThe Cash Consideration represents a premium of approximately:\no\n36 per cent. to the Closing Price of 5.50 pence per Deltic Share on 27 June 2025 (being the last trading day before the commencement of the Offer Period);\no\n34 per cent. to the volume weighted average price of 5.55 pence per Deltic Share for the one-month period to 27 June 2025 (being the last trading day before the commencement of the Offer Period);\no\n38 per cent. to the volume weighted average price of 5.41 pence per Deltic Share for the three-month period to 27 June 2025 (being the last trading day before the commencement of the Offer Period); and\no\n56 per cent. to the volume weighted average price of 4.79 pence per Deltic Share for the six-month period to 27 June 2025 (being the last trading day before the commencement of the Offer Period).\nThe Acquisition values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Deltic at approximately \u00a36.9 million on a fully diluted basis.\nIf, on or after the date of this Announcement and on or prior to the Effective Date, any dividend and/or other distribution and/or return of capital is authorised, declared, made or paid or becomes payable in respect of the Deltic Shares, Viaro Bidco reserves the right to reduce the Cash Consideration payable under the terms of the Acquisition by an amount equal to all or part of any such dividend and/or other distribution and/or return of capital, in which case Deltic Shareholders would be entitled to receive and retain any such dividend and/or other distribution and/or return of capital. Any exercise by Viaro Bidco of its rights referred to in this paragraph shall be the subject of an announcement and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be regarded as constituting any revision or variation of the terms of the Scheme or the Acquisition.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Viaro Bidco has agreed to provide a bridging loan of up to \u00a32.7 million (the \"\nBridge Financing\n\") with a view to providing Deltic with sufficient working capital prior to the Acquisition becoming Effective (further details of which are set out in paragraph\n12\nbelow).\nIn addition, in consideration for Deltic engaging in discussions with Viaro Bidco in connection with the Acquisition, Viaro Bidco has undertaken to pay, or procure the payment of, certain costs reasonably and properly incurred by Deltic in the event that the Acquisition does not complete due to the occurrence of certain trigger events (further details of which are set out in paragraph\n13\nbelow).\nIt is intended that the Acquisition will be effected by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act. However, Viaro Bidco reserves the right to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer (subject to the consent of the Panel).\nBackground to and reasons for the Acquisition\nThe Viaro Group entered the upstream oil and gas business in 2020 through the acquisition of Viaro Bidco, and has continued to invest and expand through further acquisitions in the UK and Netherlands. Viaro has ambitious growth plans for its upstream business and believes that the Acquisition would support its strategic aim of building a portfolio to deliver group production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"\nboe/d\n\").\nViaro Bidco has evaluated opportunities to expand its upstream operations in the UK North Sea and views the licence interests held by Deltic to offer significant synergies to its existing portfolio. In particular the development of the Selene discovery is a key opportunity where Viaro Bidco can leverage its expertise to add to Viaro Bidco's near-term production growth in the UK. Additionally, the Blackadder exploration opportunity is close to existing Viaro Bidco infrastructure and, if successful, cou",

A comparison of the updated B-sand porosity assumptions based on the core analysis and the previously utilised assumptions are summarised in the table below:\nReservoir Characteristic\nUnits\nPoro-Perm Assumptions\nTime post-well completion\n% Improvement\n1 Month\n6 Months\nB-Sand Porosity\nLow\n%\n11\n13\n18\nMid\n12\n14.5\n21\nHigh\n13\n16\n23\nAverage\nPermeability\nMid\nCase\nmD1\n1.6\n2.5\n56\n1\nKlinkenberg corrected for Net Overburden Pressure\nThe improved view of porosity has been incorporated into Deltic's static subsurface model and our estimates of gas-initially-in-place (or \"GIIP\") for the Selene structure.\nReservoir Modelling Update\nIncorporating the new porosity and permeability data into Deltic's dynamic reservoir model has resulted in improved overall recovery factors, higher initial flow rates, extended plateau production periods and increased estimates of gas recovered over a 20-year production life. A comparison of our 6 month post-well view with the previous reservoir modelling is set out below:\nMid-Case\nReservoir Model & Outputs1\nUnits\nAssumptions\nTime post-well completion\n% Improvement\n1 Month\n6 Months\n2 Well Development\nGas exported via Barque PB\nInitial Production Rate\nMmscf/day\n50\n70\n40\nProduction Plateau\nMonths\n8\n18\n125\nTechnically Recoverable Gas\nBCF\n130\n176.7\n36\nImplied P50 Recovery Factor\n%\n50\n57\n12\n1\nField production metrics are reported on a Gross basis, reflects mid-case (ie P50) reservoir assumptions\nGas Quality Analysis\nAnalysis of the gas samples collected from the 48/8b-3Z well have proven the presence of a very dry, methane dominated natural gas with nominal concentrations of contaminants including CO2 and N2 and our expectation is that gas produced from Selene will require minimal processing to reach National Grid entry specifications.\nUpdated Volumetric Estimate\nThe core analysis data has allowed Deltic to refine and update its volumetric estimates for the Selene Gas Project utilising the recently delivered porosity data from the core samples and updated recovery factors from the reservoir modelling.\nContingent Resources1\n[Development Pending]\n%\nImprovement2\nUnits\nBCF\nGross\nBCF\nNet to Deltic\n1C\n128\n32\n35\n2C\n174\n44\n33\n3C\n233\n58\n32\n1 Deltic's in-house estimates of Contingent Resources\n2\n% Improvement compared to EUR volumes announced via RNS on 31 October 2024\nGiven the commerciality of the project, maturity of the technical analysis and ongoing pre-development workflows it was considered appropriate to move from using Estimated Ultimate Recovery (or 'EUR') to Contingent Resources - Development Pending to describe the status of the Selene project.\nUpdated Economic Model & Project Valuation\nGiven the material uplift in recoverable gas volumes, the economic model for Selene has been updated from that previously announced in the Company's announcement released on 11 March 2025.

This process is progressing well, and Deltic expects significant amounts of data to become available over the coming months which will enhance the Company's understanding of the reservoir and provide a higher degree of confidence around potential future flow rates in a production scenario.\nGiven the legacy 3D seismic dataset over the development area was last reprocessed more than 10 years ago, the JV is considering upgrading the dataset and utilising modern processing techniques to improve seismic image quality and refine the structural model up-dip from the discovery well location. Should the JV decide to proceed with this work, which would run in parallel to other workflows, it would result in reprocessed data being available towards the first quarter of 2026 .\nUpdated Economic Model\nDeltic has revised its internal economic model for an indicative two well development of the Selene discovery, with gas export via the existing Barque production infrastructure, which incorporates updated cost and time estimates for the development recently provided by the Operator and Deltic's internal modelling, as follows:\nAssumptions\nUnits\nValue*\nDeltic Working Interest\n%\n25\nP50 Estimated Ultimate Recovery ('EUR')\nBCF\n131\nInitial Field Production Rate\nMMscf/day\n50\nGas Price\npence/therm\n80\nFirst Gas\nYear\n2029\nCost per BOE\nUSD$\n$13 CAPEX & $16 OPEX\nFiscal Regime\nAs per Budget announced\n30 October 2024\nEconomic Evaluation\nUnits\nValue*\nGross Gas Sales (cumulative)\nUSD$\n$1.6 billion\nNPV10 (pre-tax, gross)\nUSD$\n$279 million\nNPV10 (post-tax, net to Deltic)\nUSD$\n$58 million\nPayback Period\nYears\nIn year 2 of production\nInternal Rate of Return\n%\n35%\n*Values are estimates based on Deltic's own internal economic model and have not been subject to any third-party review.\nThe Company's sensitivity modelling demonstrates that the Selene Gas Project is a commercially robust development. Gas prices utilised in the model represent a significant discount to both current spot price and long-term forward gas prices indicating the potential for material upside to the NPV10 valuation quoted above.\nOn Block Upside\nBased on data acquired during the drilling of the Selene exploration well in 2024, Deltic has also reviewed the prospectivity associated with the Endymion structure located on the north-eastern corner of the P2437 licence area. Endymion is a structural extension of the depleted Mimas gas field and, following recent model updates completed after the Selene well drilling, Deltic estimates that the Endymion prospect contains P50 Prospective Resources of 70 BCF (with a P90-P10 Range of 45 to 106 BCF) with a geological chance of success (\"GCoS\") of >75%.\nIt is envisaged that the Endymion structure would be developed via a single subsea tie-back to the proposed Selene development infrastructure. Any additional gas produced from Endymion could further materially enhance the overall Selene licence project economics and could maximise the use of the proposed Selene infrastructure for a number of additional years. It is expected that any drilling on Endymion would only occur after FID on the core Selene development had been secured.\nFunding Options\nDeltic is currently evaluating a number of options, both at the corporate and asset level, which should allow it to secure the funding required to meet its medium-term requirements in relation to the Selene development. The options under evaluation include, but are not limited to, a further farm-down of Deltic's current equity position in Selene, a partial sale of its interest in Selene, a pre-payment",

With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nDeltic Energy Plc / Index: AIM / Epic: DELT / Sector: Natural Resources\n14 November 2024\nDeltic Energy Plc (\"Deltic\" or \"the Company\")\nSelene Update and Economic Model\nDeltic Energy Plc\n, the AIM quoted natural resources investing company,\nis pleased to provide the following update in relation to the recent drilling operations at the Selene prospect in the UK Southern North Sea:\nRig Demobilisation and Well Cost Estimates\nThe Valaris 123 drilling rig was demobilised from the Selene site on 10 November 2024.\nFollowing confirmation of demobilisation, the well Operator has provided an updated cost estimate for the well of USD$48M which is within the USD$49M carry cap pursuant to Deltic's farm-out arrangements in relation to the 2024 Selene drilling and testing costs. Therefore, Deltic does not expect to have any residual cost exposure to the well drilling costs.\nThe estimate of well costs will be subject to variation as the Operator receives final invoices from service providers over the coming months. As at 31 October 2024, Deltic had an unaudited cash balance of \u00a31.9M.\nEntry to Second Term of the Licence\nFollowing the announcement of the Selene discovery on 31 October 2024, Shell, in its role as licence Operator, has recommended that the Joint Venture (\"JV\") enter into the Second Term of Licence P2437 and will now seek to agree a low-cost work programme and timeline with the NSTA to support the maturation of the discovery towards a potential Final Investment Decision (\"FID\") in relation to the development of the Selene discovery.\nDuring the Second Term of the licence, the JV will complete the post-well analytical work and the various studies required to finalise a development concept. No further drilling is required prior to FID. Work will also commence on the various environmental studies to support the regulatory permitting and approvals required to progress to development.\nSelene Preliminary Development Concept\nDeltic has completed its preliminary reservoir modelling, and updated its preferred development concept, based on analysis of the data available from the 48/8b-3Z well. The technical work completed indicates that a potential development consisting of two horizontal wells would be sufficient to drain the majority of the Selene structure, based on the improved reservoir characteristics seen in the 48/8b-3Z well. Deltic's base case assumption is that a minimum facilities, normally unmanned, installation positioned on Selene will be tied back to the Barque field infrastructure via a c. 20km subsea pipeline. The Barque-Clipper-Bacton gathering system and onshore gas processing plant has sufficient capacity to accept the gas production from the proposed Selene development.\nDeltic will be promoting this potential development scenario with its Joint Venture (\"JV\") partners, however ultimately the maturation of the field development plan will be led by the licence Operator and will be subject to further review once the detailed post-well analysis has been completed.\nSelene Updated Economic Model\nDeltic has updated its internal development success case economic model, based on cost data provided by S&P Global in 2023, for the two well development concept summarised above and in light of recent changes to the UK's fiscal regime announced in the budget on 30 October 2024. The results from this update are summarised below:\nAssumptions\nUnits\nValue*\nDeltic Working Interest\n%\n25\nP50 Estimated Ultimate Recovery ('EUR')\nBCF\n131\nInitial Field Production Rate\nMMscf/day\n50\nGas Price\npence/therm\n80\nFirst Gas\nYear\n2028\nCapital expenditure (Gross)\nUSD$\n$310 million\nOperational expenditure (Gross)\nUSD$/bbl\n$15\nFiscal Regime\nAs per Budget announced\n30 October 2024\nEconomic Evaluation\nUnits\nValue*\nGross Gas Sales (cumulative)\nUSD$\n$1.5 billion\nNPV10 (pre-tax, gross)\nUSD$\n$288 million\nNPV10 (post-tax, net to Deltic)\nUSD$\n$61 million\nPayback Period\nYears\nIn year 2 of production\nInternal Rate of Return\n%\n34%\n*Values are estimates based on Deltic's own internal economic model and have not been subject to any third party review.\nThis preliminary economic evaluation indicates that the P50 discovered volume is more than twice the minimum economic field size and in the proposed assumed development scenario, Selene would have a post-tax NPV10, net to Deltic, of $61M (50 pence/share equivalent) which supports Deltic's decision to support the entry into the second term of Licence P2437 and progress the work required to reach FID.\nAndrew Nunn, CEO, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report that the Selene discovery well was completed safely and within the carry resulting from the farm-outs",

The top of the Leman Sandstone was encountered approximately 70 metres deep to prognosis with elevated mud gas readings, confirming the presence of gas, observed throughout the reservoir interval and into the underlying Carboniferous basement.\nSubsequent wireline logging and fluid sampling have confirmed the presence of a live gas column above a gas-water contact at c. 3,370 metres which is in the middle of the B-Sand, the key producing interval within the overall Leman Sandstone section. Updated post-well structural maps of the Selene prospect point towards a maximum gas column of c. 100 metres.\nInitial indications point towards a high-quality dry gas, typical of production from adjacent fields, with no reported H2S.\nUpdated Volumetric Estimates\nBased on the preliminary information available from the wellsite, Deltic has updated its volumetric model of the Selene discovery and now estimates Selene to contain gross P50 estimated ultimate recoverable (or 'EUR') resources of 131 BCF (P90-P10 range of 95 to 176 BCF) which is at the lower end of pre-drill estimates.\nHowever, the bulk of the recoverable resources are concentrated in the higher quality B-Sand up-dip from the 48/8b-3Z well location which should support a simpler and cheaper development option with greater gas production per well than was envisaged pre-discovery.\nThe combination of a deeper structural crest and a shallower gas water contact has resulted in reduced gas column heights across the structure. The base of the B-Sand and most of the underlying C-Sand are now believed to be in the water leg across the south-eastern part of the structure, with the deeper gas readings from the well now interpreted as residual gas rather than a live gas column.\nReservoir Quality Better than Expected\nThe well has confirmed that the B-Sand reservoir properties at the well location were towards the high end of the ranges predicted pre-drill. The B-Sand encountered in the well was 53 metres thick (pre-drill P50 of 47 metres) with an average porosity of 12.1% (up from 11% P50 pre-drill) and a gas saturation in-line with pre-drill expectations.\nThese improved reservoir characteristics are supported by a downhole test, which recovered gas samples, and indicated permeabilities in the range of 1 to 5mD above the gas-water contact. These porosity and permeability attributes support the use of more favourable recovery factors for the B-Sand in the updated volumetric model.\nAs previously indicated, this well was not designed to accommodate a conventional surface flow test and all of the reservoir data required to support a potential future development plan and investment decision has been successfully acquired through this well.\nNext Steps\nFollowing demobilisation of the rig which is expected towards the end of next week, there will be a\nperiod of detailed analysis of wireline data, core samples, fluid samples and pressure testing data which will further refine the geological model, volumetric estimates and the proposed development plan.\nBased on the results of the well and the data collected, Deltic believes that the JV should be well placed to progress towards field development planning and a final investment decision on a future development without requiring a further appraisal well.\nIn addition to Selene, Deltic will re-evaluate the Endymion prospect, located on the north-eastern corner of the block, which is another low-risk Leman Sandstone opportunity that could be tied into any future Selene development.\nAs the JV updates the development plan Deltic will re-assess its economic models, however pre-drill modelling indicates that volumes over 100 BCF recoverable will remain economically viable, and ultimately produce material positive cash flows for the Deltic, under the fiscal regime announced in the budget on 30 October 2024.\nAndrew Nunn, CEO, commented:\n\"Subsurface expertise lies at the heart of the Deltic equity story and remains central to the strategic approach we recently laid out for the Company. In this context, the outcome of the Selene well is a good result overall ",

With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nDeltic Energy Plc / Index: AIM / Epic: DELT / Sector: Natural Resources\n21 October 2024\nDeltic Energy Plc (\"Deltic\" or \"the Company\")\nOperational and Strategic Update\nNon-Executive Board Change\nChange of Broker\nDeltic Energy Plc\n, the AIM quoted natural resources investing company,\nprovides the following strategic, operational and organisational update:\nStrategic Evolution\nFor the last decade, Deltic has invested in its UK portfolio and achieved material exploration success despite the well-publicised political and fiscal headwinds that have hampered the UK's oil and gas industry in recent years. It is clear that, while this situation persists, the UK is not the ideal place in which to invest in new oil and gas exploration or appraisal opportunities. Therefore, the Board has carefully considered the best way to leverage the Company's international experience and expertise to create value for shareholders going forward.\nOver the next 12 months, Deltic's strategic focus will be on:\n\u00b7\nExtraction of value from its existing core UK assets, principally the Selene prospect, while eliminating or deferring expenditure on non-core UK assets\n\u00b7\nLeveraging the Company's core subsurface skill sets, which have been deployed successfully across a range of international territories historically, to identify and access opportunities in overseas arenas with an initial focus on projects with early cash flows and faster cycle times from entry to value crystallisation\n\u00b7\nHigh-impact exploration will always be an integral part of Deltic's DNA, and the Company will continue to selectively pursue these types of opportunities which could provide significant upside for shareholders in the medium to longer term\nNon-Executive Board Change\nPeter Cowley has agreed to step down from the Board of Deltic with immediate effect and leaves with the Board's best wishes. There are no plans to recruit a replacement for Peter in the shorter term and the Company will continue with Mark Lappin and Peter Nicol as its independent non-executive directors while it works through this strategic transition.\nDrilling Operations - Selene Exploration Well\nWell operations continue on the high-impact Selene exploration well. The Shell operated well reached its total target depth of 3540 metres on 17 October 2024 and encountered a 160 metre thick section of Leman Sandstone with gas present throughout.\nWhile initial observations are clearly encouraging, Deltic will need to wait on further results from the logging and fluid sampling operations before providing a comprehensive update in due course.\nDeltic has a 25% working interest in the Selene licence which is located in the heart of the long-established Leman Sandstone gas play in the Southern North Sea. In a success case, the intention would be to proceed directly to field development planning as further appraisal drilling is not considered to be necessary to support a future development investment decision.\nBlackadder Licence P2672 - Farm-out Interest\nGiven the positive read across from Selene to the Blackadder prospect, Deltic has been in receipt of farm-in interest in the licence from a number of companies. The Company will look to capitalise on this third-party interest to materially reduce or eliminate its cost exposure to the forward work programme on this licence. To allow time for these discussions to mature, Deltic intends to defer the commencement of planned work programmes until at least mid-2025, minimising any near-term expenditure.\nSyros Licence P2542 - Central North Sea\nDespite the excellent technical work completed by the Deltic team, which significantly de-risked the Syros prospect, the ongoing political and fiscal uncertainty has prevented a number of parties that participated in the farm-out process from moving forward with a transaction. Deltic has requested a 12-month extension from the NSTA to Phase A to allow a period of stability post the October budget in which Deltic could re-engage with those interested parties. However, the NSTA has indicated it is not minded to support the request and therefore it is likely this licence will now expire on 30 November 2024.\nDewar Licence P2646 - Central North Sea\nGiven the continuing deterioration of the fiscal and operating environment in the UK since this licence was awarded in February 2024, Deltic has entered into negotiations with the NSTA in relation to the Phase A work programme requirements on Licence P2646. Deltic does not intend to incur any of the planned costs associated with the Phase A work programme in 2025.\nChange of Broker Arrangements\nIn recognition of the situation in which the ",

          "full_content": "15 Oct 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 1447I\nDeltic Energy PLC\n15 October 2024\nPrior to publication, the information contained within this announcement was deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the UK Market Abuse Regulation. With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nDeltic Energy Plc / Index: AIM / Epic: DELT / Sector: Natural Resources\n15 October 2024\nDeltic Energy Plc (\"Deltic\" or \"the Company\")\nChief Executive Officer Change/Succession\nDeltic Energy Plc\nannounces that Graham Swindells, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), has informed the board of his intention to step down as CEO, effectively immediately, and that he will be succeeded by Andrew Nunn, the Company's current Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\").\nAndrew joined Deltic in 2014 and has been COO since 2015. Andrew is a geologist with over 25 years of experience working on exploration projects across Europe, Africa and Australasia. In his role as COO of Deltic, Andrew has led the successful development of the Company's exploration portfolio and has been instrumental in securing licences and multiple farm outs to world-class partners. Andrew was also key to the origination and maturation of the Pensacola discovery and the Selene prospect, where drilling operations are ongoing.\nMark Lappin, Chairman of the Company, said:\n\"Graham will leave with the profound thanks of the board for his commitment and contribution to Deltic over the last 11 years, initially as CFO and more recently as CEO. Under Graham's leadership, Deltic was transformed into a company with an attractive portfolio of licences along with world-class partners, positioning it at the forefront of UK exploration. I am delighted to confirm Andrew's appointment as Chief Executive Officer. The combination of his experience, knowledge and commercial acumen makes him the ideal person to take the business forward.\"\nCommenting, Graham Swindells said\n:\n\"Despite the recent challenges presented by the UK's political and fiscal environment, I am proud of what we have achieved in establishing Deltic as one of the UK's leading explorers. As the team seeks to extract the maximum value from the existing UK asset base and rebuild a portfolio focussed outside of the UK, now is the appropriate time for me to hand over the role of CEO to Andrew who I have had the pleasure of working alongside for the last 10 years and believe is an outstanding successor.\"\nAndrew Nunn comments:\n\"Graham has led Deltic through some of the toughest and most volatile times I've ever experienced in this industry. Our small team has delivered what would have been, at any other time in the industry's history, a company-making success with the Pensacola discovery. Deltic has the potential for a second major discovery at Selene where drilling operations are ongoing. Our progress to date has been carefully watched and recognised by our industry peers. We anticipate shortly announcing a series of measures to reduce the Company's overheads. It will then be our job to capitalise on that hard-earned reputation and credibility as we look further afield to find value for shareholders. The initial focus will be on identifying and accessing those opportunities which deliver immediate, or very near term, cash flow while we incubate those high-impact exploration opportunities that will always be part of Deltic's DNA.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please contact the following:\nDeltic Energy Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7887 2630\nAndrew Nunn / Sarah McLeod\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart / Alex Brearley (Corporate Finance)\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nCallum Stewart / Simon Mensley / Ashton Clanfield\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7523 8000\nAdam James / Charlie Hammond\nVigo Consulting\n(IR Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7390 0230\nPatrick d'Ancona / Finlay Thomson / Kendall Hill\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Yet another  AIM-traded firm loser. - Deltic Energy agreed to a recommended cash offer from Rockrose Energy, a subsidiary of Viaro Energy, it announced on Monday, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a36.9m. Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Michael Spencer bought a hell of a traunche at a fund raise, paying 2.75p before the consolidation. His loss on those shares will be humungous. It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely. At least the loss here can be offset against profits elsewhere, which is probably the best way to look at it.",

Shareholders have been told Court Hearing to occur early Q4 (  early October)  No mention od the precise date in the RNS today. I wrote end August, following Shareholder approval, asking what date was booked for the Court to approve the Scheme of Arrangment.  Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

It's all in the announcement, and previous ones. The only way out for a higher price is a higher takeover offer. Viaro energy are activley looking to buy up assets and seem to have deep pockets. Will anyone with deeper pockets launch a rival bid? Otherwise its a done deal. Wait until Q4 for the deal to close, wait for a higher offer, or sell now and move on.

Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Michael Spencer bought a hell of a traunche at a fund raise, paying 2.75p before the consolidation. His loss on those shares will be humungous. It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely. At least the loss here can be offset against profits elsewhere, which is probably the best way to look at it.",

The dilemma and assuming the Arrangement is passed ( IMO it all depends on Michael Spencer), PI's will recieve 7.5p/share sometime during October to 31st December, which is quite sometime after the Court and GM will have approved ( 28th August}  The scheme of agreement documents are very imprecise continually stating the \" D \" date plus.

The issue o Viaro Bidco Loan, \u00a32.7m, as of 30th June. Does anyone know exactly what this supposed to fund?",

Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

Shareholders have been told Court Hearing to occur early Q4 (  early October)  No mention od the precise date in the RNS today. I wrote end August, following Shareholder approval, asking what date was booked for the Court to approve the Scheme of Arrangment.  Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

It's all in the announcement, and previous ones. The only way out for a higher price is a higher takeover offer. Viaro energy are activley looking to buy up assets and seem to have deep pockets. Will anyone with deeper pockets launch a rival bid? Otherwise its a done deal. Wait until Q4 for the deal to close, wait for a higher offer, or sell now and move on.

Yet another  AIM-traded firm loser. - Deltic Energy agreed to a recommended cash offer from Rockrose Energy, a subsidiary of Viaro Energy, it announced on Monday, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a36.9m. Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\".

Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone.

Michael Spencer bought a hell of a traunche at a fund raise, paying 2.75p before the consolidation. His loss on those shares will be humungous. It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely. At least the loss here can be offset against profits elsewhere, which is probably the best way to look at it.",

Yet another  AIM-traded firm loser. - Deltic Energy agreed to a recommended cash offer from Rockrose Energy, a subsidiary of Viaro Energy, it announced on Monday, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a36.9m. Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

Shareholders have been told Court Hearing to occur early Q4 (  early October)  No mention od the precise date in the RNS today. I wrote end August, following Shareholder approval, asking what date was booked for the Court to approve the Scheme of Arrangment.  Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

The scheme of arrangement whereby Rockrose ( Viaro Bidco) take us out has the Court process to go through, votes must be in by 26th August. PI's will need to search Deltic's website to find and dowonload various documents. The dilemma and assuming the Arrangement is passed ( IMO it all depends on Michael Spencer), PI's will recieve 7.5p/share sometime during October to 31st December, which is quite sometime after the Court and GM will have approved ( 28th August}  The scheme of agreement documents are very imprecise continually stating the \" D \" date plus. The D date having no proposed date that I can see.. Waiting for the settlement date reduces the ability to offset Capital Losses individuals may want to use during the current Tax year. Selling soonest may overcome that issue even though at a lower value. Dealing with the CGT  is an individual matter,  contary views and views at all are wellcome.

It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely.

Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

PI's will need to search Deltic's website to find and dowonload various documents. The dilemma and assuming the Arrangement is passed ( IMO it all depends on Michael Spencer), PI's will recieve 7.5p/share sometime during October to 31st December, which is quite sometime after the Court and GM will have approved ( 28th August}  The scheme of agreement documents are very imprecise continually stating the \" D \" date plus. The D date having no proposed date that I can see.. Waiting for the settlement date reduces the ability to offset Capital Losses individuals may want to use during the current Tax year. Selling soonest may overcome that issue even though at a lower value. Dealing with the CGT  is an individual matter,  contary views and views at all are wellcome.

It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely.

Yet another  AIM-traded firm loser. - Deltic Energy agreed to a recommended cash offer from Rockrose Energy, a subsidiary of Viaro Energy, it announced on Monday, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a36.9m. Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

Unfortuneately Delt has been dogged by mealy mouthed Execs whose only skills seem to be lining thier own pockets. Michael Spencer bought a hell of a traunche at a fund raise, paying 2.75p before the consolidation. His loss on those shares will be humungous. It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely. At least the loss here can be offset against profits elsewhere, which is probably the best way to look at it.",

Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\".

Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone.

The scheme of arrangement whereby Rockrose ( Viaro Bidco) take us out has the Court process to go through, votes must be in by 26th August. PI's will need to search Deltic's website to find and dowonload various documents. The dilemma and assuming the Arrangement is passed ( IMO it all depends on Michael Spencer), PI's will recieve 7.5p/share sometime during October to 31st December, which is quite sometime after the Court and GM will have approved ( 28th August}  The scheme of agreement documents are very imprecise continually stating the \" D \" date plus. The D date having no proposed date that I can see.. Waiting for the settlement date reduces the ability to offset Capital Losses individuals may want to use during the current Tax year. Selling soonest may overcome that issue even though at a lower value. Dealing with the CGT  is an individual matter,  contary views and views at all are wellcome.

It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely. At least the loss here can be offset against profits elsewhere, which is probably the best way to look at it.",

Yet another  AIM-traded firm loser. - Deltic Energy agreed to a recommended cash offer from Rockrose Energy, a subsidiary of Viaro Energy, it announced on Monday, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a36.9m. Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\". Deltic and Rockrose agreed to extend the long stop date to March 31 from December 31.",

Answer from Allenbys who are handling the process, on 3rd September. In essence nothing could be booked as Legal Beavers on Holiday (August) and Court Listings are  delayed. Re-emphasised likely to be early October. Checked Commercial Court availablity  last week to discover short hearings ( 1-2 hours) available 1 st week October. As a result emailed the Officer at Allenbys to recieve an out of Office reply. Officer handling on annual leave until 8th October. No urgency it would seem. Cash almost gone. Likely Viaro Bidco loan is being drawn down if only to pay Salaries. The \" Going Concern Statement\" needs careful reading. Will Shareholders get payed? Form your own opinions",

Unfortuneately Delt has been dogged by mealy mouthed Execs whose only skills seem to be lining thier own pockets. Michael Spencer bought a hell of a traunche at a fund raise, paying 2.75p before the consolidation. His loss on those shares will be humungous. It is also true MS has collaborated with Cluff, after his resignation here, in forming Cluff Energy (Africa) a private company. It can only be speculation as to how that company has performed. AIM Oilers are not for Long term investors, short term ( Traders) who dip in and out can profit nicely. At least the loss here can be offset against profits elsewhere, which is probably the best way to look at it.",

Under the terms of the acquisition, Deltic shareholders would receive 7.46p per share in cash, representing a 36% premium to the closing price on 27 June. The AIM-traded firm said the deal would be implemented via a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement. Viaro had also agreed to provide Deltic with a \u00a32.7m bridging loan to support working capital ahead of completion. The acquisition would deliver a premium of 34% over the one-month average share price, 38% over the three-month average, and 56% over the six-month average to 27 June. Deltic's board unanimously recommended the offer, citing the increasingly challenging fiscal and political backdrop for UK oil and gas exploration.",

Shares look set for a third successive daily slide. On Wednesday, it announced the long stop date by which its takeover by Viaro Energy Ltd must complete amid a delay from regulatory concerns. The investor with an exploration and appraisal portfolio in the southern and central North Sea said completion of the acquisition remains subject to outstanding conditions including the consent of the North Sea Transition Authority. Deltic said the UK North Sea regulator requires further representations from Rockrose and Deltic \"in order to reach a definitive conclusion in relation to concerns it has which will affect whether it will grant the proposed change of control of the licences held by Deltic\".
