(hereinafter - \"the Company\") comprising the condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position as of June 30, 2022 and the related condensed interim consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated cash flows for the six month period then ended. The board of directors and management are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim consolidated financial statements based on our review.\nScope of the Review\nWe conducted our review in accordance with the Israeli Review Standard (Israel) 2410, \"Review of Financial Information for Interim Periods Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" of the Association of Certified Public Accountants in Israel. A review of financial information for interim periods consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Auditing Standards accepted in Israel. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all the significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nBasis for the Qualified Conclusion\nWe were not satisfied in regard to the approximately NIS 58 million amount of impairment of the exploration assets that was included in expenses in the Company statements of comprehensive loss for the year 2021, and in accordance, in regard to the amount of dividend in kind presented in the financial statements.\nConclusion\nBased on our review, except for the abovementioned item, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to suspect that the financial information abovementioned was not prepared, from all significant aspects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34.\nWe draw attention to:\nNote 1d of the condensed interim financial statements - the Company has accumulated losses since its inception and does not have any operations that yield revenues. Financing of its operations has, until now, been performed by infusions of capital and/or loans. The Company has plans of installation of new operations, but there is uncertainty in this regard. These facts raise significant doubt as to the continued existence of the Company as a \"going concern.\"\nThese condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the value of the assets and liabilities and their classifications that would possibly be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a \"going concern.\"\nBarzily & Co.\nCertified Public Accountants\nA Member of MSI Worldwide\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\nCONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(In NIS in thousands)\nJune 30\n,\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2021\nNote\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n228\n11\n853\nOther accounts receivable\n181\n109\n8\nTotal current assets\n409\n120\n861\nAssets for distribution to shareholders\n-\n41,620\n-\nTotal Assets\n409\n41,740\n861\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nCapital\nShare Capital\n(7,412)\n23,421\n(6,573)\nNon-current Liabilities:\nOptions convertible to shares\n-\n8\n-\nTotal Non-current Liabilities\n-\n8\n-\nCurrent Liabilities:\nShort-term credit from bank and others\n-\n358\n-\nTrade payables\n13\n310\n9\nOther accounts payable\n81\n507\n94\nLoans convertible to shares\n-\n181\n-\nLiabilities at fair value\n7,727\n7,570\n7,331\nTotal current liabilities\n7,821\n8,926\n7,434\nLiabilities for distribution to shareholders\n-\n9,385\n-\nTotal Equity and Liabilities\n409\n41,740\n861\nThe accompanying notes to these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are an integral part thereof.\nOctober 31, 2022\nDate of Approval of the Financial Statements\nAlon Shani\nCEO\nDavid Ben David, Acct.\nController\nDirector\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\n[Formerly Shefa Yamim (A.T.M.)

In the framework of these changes, the prospecting and exploration operations in search for precious stones and gold, performed by the Company from its inception until March 2022, would be transferred to its subsidiary (Shefa in Israel (G.M) Ltd., hereinafter - \"the subsidiary\").\nc.\nOn August 9, 2021 the\nspecial meeting of the Company's shareholder\napproved the agreement signed between the Company and Shani group (hereinafter \"the agreement\". This agreement includes:\nDistribution of shares of Shefa Israel (formerly \"the subsidiary)\", directly to the Company's shareholders, as a dividend in kind-\nDuring January 2021, all exploration assets and their attributed operations were transferred to Shefa Israel. As consideration, Shefa Israel allocated shares to the Company. As part as the agreement, the shares were transferred to an agreed trustee (Mr. Nathan Druckman, Adv.) in order to enable him to allocate the Subsidiary's shares on a pro-rata basis, to all the company's shareholders at the determination date (August 10, 2021). Distribution will take place as part of a dividend in-kind subject to and subsequent to approval by the Court.\nThis distribution was recorded as a dividend for distribution in the Company's financial statements.\nd.\nThe Company has accumulated losses since its inception and does not have any operations that yield revenues. Financing of its operations has, until now, been performed by infusions of capital and/or loans. The Company has plans of installation of new operations, but there is uncertainty in this regard. These facts raise significant doubt as to the continued existence of the Company as a \"going concern.\"\nThese condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the value of the assets and liabilities and their classifications that would possibly be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a \"going concern.\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In NIS in thousands)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDeclaration in regard to Implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\na.\nThe condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting.\" The financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (hereinafter: \"the Annual Financial Statements\"). However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Company's financial position and performance since the Annual Financial Statements.\nThese financial statements were authorized by the Company's board of directors on October 31, 2022.\nForeign Currency and Linkage Basis\nb.\nDetail in regard to the change in the Consumer Price Index and the exchange rate of the foreign currency:\nFor the Period of Six Months Ended June 30,\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2021\nChange in CPI (applicable)\n3.22%\n1.59%\n2.8%\nChange in CPI (known)\n3.13%\n1.41%\n2.4%\nChange in rate of exchange - U.S. $\nChange in rate of exchange - GBP - \u00a3\n7.9%\n(6.3%)\n1.4%\n2.9%\n0.9%\n2.9%\nc.\nJudgments and Estimates\nIn preparing these Interim Financial Statements in accordance with the IFRS, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. We clarify that actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe significant judgments made by management in applying the Company's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation that served for estimates that are bound up with uncertainty were consistent with those that were applied in the Annual Financial Statements.\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In NIS in thousands)\nNOTE 3:- SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO BALANCE SHEET DATE\na.

Following a strategic review, it was determined that the Company could no longer justify the costs of being a listed company, and that any future funds raised on the basis of exploration activity should be entirely dedicated to the development of mining activity. On 1 June 2021, the Company announced an agreement with the \"Shany Group,\" a consortium of investors led by Mr. Alon Shany and Ms. Eva Abittan, wherein the Shany Group and other unrelated parties would pay an amount of approximately GBP 756,000 in return for a subscription to approximately 85% of the Company's issued share capital. Additionally, the Company would transfer all of its exploration and mining assets to its formerly wholly-owned subsidiary, Shefa in Israel (G.M.) Ltd (the \"Subsidiary\", a private company registered in Israel), and distribute ownership of the Subsidiary to all of the Company's existing Shareholders via a dividend\nin specie\n. The transaction was approved by the Company's shareholders on 9 August 2021.

(hereinafter - \"the Company\") comprising the condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position as of June 30, 2022 and the related condensed interim consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated cash flows for the six month period then ended. The board of directors and management are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim consolidated financial statements based on our review.\nScope of the Review\nWe conducted our review in accordance with the Israeli Review Standard (Israel) 2410, \"Review of Financial Information for Interim Periods Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" of the Association of Certified Public Accountants in Israel. A review of financial information for interim periods consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Auditing Standards accepted in Israel. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all the significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nBasis for the Qualified Conclusion\nWe were not satisfied in regard to the approximately NIS 58 million amount of impairment of the exploration assets that was included in expenses in the Company statements of comprehensive loss for the year 2021, and in accordance, in regard to the amount of dividend in kind presented in the financial statements.\nConclusion\nBased on our review, except for the abovementioned item, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to suspect that the financial information abovementioned was not prepared, from all significant aspects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34.\nWe draw attention to:\nNote 1d of the condensed interim financial statements - the Company has accumulated losses since its inception and does not have any operations that yield revenues. Financing of its operations has, until now, been performed by infusions of capital and/or loans. The Company has plans of installation of new operations, but there is uncertainty in this regard. These facts raise significant doubt as to the continued existence of the Company as a \"going concern.\"\nThese condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the value of the assets and liabilities and their classifications that would possibly be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a \"going concern.\"\nBarzily & Co.\nCertified Public Accountants\nA Member of MSI Worldwide\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\nCONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(In NIS in thousands)\nJune 30\n,\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2021\nNote\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n228\n11\n853\nOther accounts receivable\n181\n109\n8\nTotal current assets\n409\n120\n861\nAssets for distribution to shareholders\n-\n41,620\n-\nTotal Assets\n409\n41,740\n861\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nCapital\nShare Capital\n(7,412)\n23,421\n(6,573)\nNon-current Liabilities:\nOptions convertible to shares\n-\n8\n-\nTotal Non-current Liabilities\n-\n8\n-\nCurrent Liabilities:\nShort-term credit from bank and others\n-\n358\n-\nTrade payables\n13\n310\n9\nOther accounts payable\n81\n507\n94\nLoans convertible to shares\n-\n181\n-\nLiabilities at fair value\n7,727\n7,570\n7,331\nTotal current liabilities\n7,821\n8,926\n7,434\nLiabilities for distribution to shareholders\n-\n9,385\n-\nTotal Equity and Liabilities\n409\n41,740\n861\nThe accompanying notes to these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are an integral part thereof.\nOctober 31, 2022\nDate of Approval of the Financial Statements\nAlon Shani\nCEO\nDavid Ben David, Acct.\nController\nDirector\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\n[Formerly Shefa Yamim ",

Accordingly, on 9th August 2021, the Company convened a shareholders' meeting at which the following resolutions were approved:\n1. Acquisition strategy-\nIt was approved that the Company will become a cash shell seeking acquisition opportunities in the web technology and software space.\nAccordingly an equity subscription of Ordinary Shares was completed, at a price of USD ~0.0005 (approximately 0.00031 GBP) for each Ordinary Share, raising a total of USD 1,050,000 (GBP 756,000).\u00a0The Subscription Shares have been allotted to investors but will only be admitted trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange following publication of a prospectus, in accordance with Listing Rule 14.3.4, and a completed Application for Admission to Trading. The Company intends to progress preparation of a prospectus as soon as practicable.\nShould an acquisition of a new activity be completed it would constitute a reverse takeover under the Listing Rules and the Company would apply for the readmission of its shares to the Official List and the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company has currently not identified a suitable acquisition target but will particularly focus on the key areas of high growth delivering digital services to consumers in areas such as leisure, financials, e-commerce, gaming, as well as disruptive technologies such as blockchain and crypto currencies. In addition, the Company will also look at potential targets in the software space.\nShould the Company identify a suitable target, it will, in accordance with the Listing Rules, publish a prospectus containing all information required for the approval of a reverse takeover.\nAt present, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify a suitable acquisition target or that it will be able to complete any contemplated transaction and, as a consequence, the Company's admission to the Standard Listing segment of the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities may be cancelled.\n2. Change of name-\nThe Company intends to change its name to\u00a0\"Alef Bet Advanced Technologies (2021)\", or a similar name, as approved by the Israeli Registrar of Companies.\nThe purpose of the name change is to more closely reflect the Company's strategy to develop its business across the web technology and software space.\nFollowing the change of name the Company will make application to the London Stock Exchange to change its TDIM symbol from \"SEFA\" to \"ALEF\". Shareholders should note that their shareholdings will be unaffected by the change of name, although new share certificates will be issued to Shareholders following the name change and completion of the Proposed Combined Transaction. The Company will notify the market of when the change of name and TIDM will be effective.\n3. Changes to the Company's registered capital-\nThe registered share capital of the Company has increased to 1,000,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares and the par value of the Ordinary Shares has been cancelled. The amended Articles of Association of the Company have been placed on the Company's website.\n4. Board changes-\nMr Alon Shany (Executive Chairman), Mr. Jacques Abitbol (Non-Executive Director), Ms Eva Abittan (Non-Executive Director), Ms. Irit Ben - Ami (External Director) and Mr. Avi Levin (External Director) have been appointed to the Board. Michael Rosenberg, David Nachshon, Gershon Frenkel, Zvi Nemeth, James Campbell, Natan Drukman and Yossef Taub have stepped down from the Board. Ms Nathalie Schwarz remains on the board as an External Non-Executive Director.\nAnnual and extraordinary shareholders' meeting\nThe following resolutions were approved by the general meeting held on 12 May 2022:\n1. Receiving the Company's financial statements and annual reports for the year ended 31 December 2021 (and the reports of the directors and auditors in relation to).\n2. Re-appointing Barzily & Co. as the Company's auditors and authorizing the directors of the Company to determine their remuneration.\n3. Re-electing Mr. Alon Shany,\nMr. Jacques Abit",

The trustee will update on the schedule and progress of the process and any matter concerning the disposal of the mining business - through the RNS reporting system.\nAcquisition strategy\nAs outlined in the Circular, following the disposal of the mining business, the Company will become a cash shell seeking acquisition opportunities in the web technology and software space.\nShould an acquisition be completed it would constitute a reverse takeover under the Listing Rules and the Company would apply for the readmission of its shares to the Official List and the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company has currently not identified a suitable acquisition target but will particularly focus on the key areas of high growth delivering digital services to consumers in areas such as leisure, financials, e-commerce, gaming, as well as disruptive technologies such as blockchain and crypto currencies. In addition, the Company will also look at potential targets in the software space. The Directors and New Directors believe that the areas of B2B software, Customer Relationship Management software and corporate risk management software present a good opportunity for the Company to create shareholder value.\nShould the Company identify a suitable target, it will, in accordance with the Listing Rules, publish a prospectus containing all information required for the approval of a reverse takeover. At present, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify a suitable acquisition target or that it will be able to complete any contemplated transaction and, as a consequence, the Company's admission to the Standard Listing segment of the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities may be cancelled.\nChange of Name\nThe Company intends to change its name to\n\"Alef Bet Advanced Technologies (2021\n)\", or a similar name, as approved by the Israeli Registrar of Companies\n.\nThe purpose of the name change is to more closely reflect the Company's strategy to develop its business across the web technology and software space.\nFollowing the change of name the Company will make application to the London Stock Exchange to change its TDIM symbol from \"SEFA\" to \"ALEF\". Shareholders should note that their shareholdings will be unaffected by the change of name, although new share certificates will be issued to Shareholders following the name change and completion of the Proposed Combined Transaction. The Company will notify the market of when the change of name and TIDM will be effective.\nIn the next couple of day the company will complete the equity subscription of Ordinary Shares at a price of USD ~0.0005 (approximately 0.00031 GBP) for each Ordinary Share, raising a total of USD 1,050,000 (GBP 756,000).\nThe allotment of the Subscription Shares has triggered the requirement for a prospectus to be published in respect of those shares. The Subscription Shares have been allotted to investors but will only be admitted trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange following publication of a prospectus in accordance with Listing Rule 14.3.4. The Company intends to progress preparation of a prospectus as soon as practicable.\nThe registered share capital of the Company has increased to 1,000,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares and the par value of the Ordinary Shares has been cancelled. The amended Articles of Association of the Company have been placed on the Company's website.\nBoard changes\nThe Company confirms that Mr Alon Shany (Executive Chairman), Mr. Jacques Abitbol (Non-Executive Director), Ms Eva Abittan (Non-Executive Director) have today been appointed to the Board. Michael Rosenberg, David Nachshon, Gershon Frenkel, Zvi Nemeth, James Campbell and Natan Drukman have stepped down from the Board. Mr Yossef Taub remains on the board as a regular director, and Ms Nathalie Schwarz remains on the board as an independent Non-Executive Director.\nTotal Voting Rights\nOnce admitted to tradin",

Share Consolidation and Record Date\nFurther to the announcement made on 1 June 2021, Shefa Gems (LSE: SEFA) has today published a circular (the \"\nCircular\n\") in relation to the Proposed Combined Transaction. Further details on the Proposed Combined Transaction can be found in the Circular.\nThe Proposed Combined Transaction is conditional on the approval of Shefa Gems' shareholders. Accordingly, the Circular contains a notice convening a Special General Meeting of the Company which is to be held at 12:00 p.m. on 9 August 2021 at the Company's headquarters at 90 Herzel St. Natanya, Israel as well as via the Zoom software, at which a resolution will be proposed for Shefa Gems' shareholders to approve the Proposed Combined Transaction (the \"\nNotice of Special General Meeting\n\").\nThe Circular and the Notice of Special General Meeting will be available for viewing on Shefa Gems' website at\nwww.shefagems.com\n.\nIn the announcement made on 1 June 2021, the Company referred to a proposal to undertake a share consolidation on the basis of 100 Ordinary Shares for 1 Ordinary Consolidated Shares. However, the Board having consulted with the Shany Group, has decided that this is not appropriate at the current time and the Company is only proposing to increase the Company's registered share capital to 1 trillion Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company and to cancel the par value of the Ordinary Shares.\nIn the announcement made on 1 June 2021, the Record Date for the Proposed Combined Transaction was stated to be 1 June 2021. Because of the change in scope of the Proposed Combined Transaction, and given that the proposed share consolidation will not proceed, the Record Date for voting at the Special General Meeting of the Company is changed to 12 July 2021 and the record date for the entitlement to the distribution dividend (the \"\nDividend Record Date\n\") is changed to 8 August 2021, being the date before the Special General Meeting of the Company.\nNote that unless the counterparties specifically agree otherwise, a buyer of Ordinary Shares before the Ex -entitlement Date (being 10 August 2021, the day after the Special General Meeting, assuming the Resolution is duly passed), will assume the benefit of the right to the shares in the Subsidiary from the seller and such seller would need to pass the benefit of this right to the buyer, even if the seller is the recorded owner of the Ordinary Shares being sold by it at the Dividend Record Date.\nPlease find the full timetable below:\n2021\nPosting of this Circular and Form of Proxy to Shareholders and Forms of Instruction to Depositary Interest holders\n5 July\nRecord Date for voting at the Special General Meeting\n12 July\nLatest time and date for receipt of Forms of Instruction\n12:00 PM on 6 August\nLatest time and date for receipt of Forms of Proxy\n12:00 PM on 7 August\nDividend Record Date\n8 August\nSpecial General Meeting\n12:00 PM on 9 August\nEx-entitlement date for the distribution dividend\n10 August\n- Ends -\nEnquiries\nShefa Gems Ltd\nMichael Rosenberg, OBE\u00a0-\u00a0Chairman\nwww.shefagems.com\n+44 7785 727595\nVSA Capital Limited\u00a0- Financial Adviser\nAndrew Raca, Pascal Wiese\n+44 20 3005 5000\nNotes to Editors\nAbout\u00a0Shefa Gems Ltd\nPending completion of the Combined Proposed Transaction, Shefa Gems Ltd (LSE: SEFA) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Shefa in Israel (G.M.) Ltd (the \"\nSubsidiary\n\") is an explorer and developer of precious gems deposits operating in Northern Israel. Exploration activity is managed by professionally skilled and technically competent personnel and is accompanied by an international team of geological experts. All exploration activities are conducted under international standards and the internationally recognized SAMREC 2016 Code.\nShefa Gems has established a \"Source to Sink\" geological model and the presence of a Target Mineral Assemblage of gemstones (\"TMA Suite\") in both primary volcanic sources and in secondary alluvial deposits lying within the Kishon catchment, on Mount Carmel and in the Zevulun and Yizre'el valleys and their margins. The TMA suite comprises Precious Stones (Diamond, rare natural moissanite, sapphire, ruby, Carmel Sapphire\u2122, garnet, hibonite, spinel, ilmenite) and heavy minerals including zircon and rutile.\nOn March 2020, the Quarries and Mines Branch of the Ministry of National Infrastructures of the State of Israel has awarded a Certificate of Discovery to the Subsidiary covering the projected gemstone mine development in the Kishon Mid Reach, Zones 1 and 2.

I thought at first Shefa Gems was one of those but, from what you've explained, if I bought in here I'd be investing in a company from scratch so no idea, from a historical share price track record, what the potential the share price could reach.  So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",

So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",

So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",

So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",

So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",

So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",

I thought at first Shefa Gems was one of those but, from what you've explained, if I bought in here I'd be investing in a company from scratch so no idea, from a historical share price track record, what the potential the share price could reach.  So probably not for me but very best of luck to everyone here who is going to invest.",
