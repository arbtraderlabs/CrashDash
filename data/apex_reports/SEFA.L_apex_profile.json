(hereinafter - \"the Company\") comprising the condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position as of June 30, 2022 and the related condensed interim consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated cash flows for the six month period then ended. The board of directors and management are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim consolidated financial statements based on our review.\nScope of the Review\nWe conducted our review in accordance with the Israeli Review Standard (Israel) 2410, \"Review of Financial Information for Interim Periods Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" of the Association of Certified Public Accountants in Israel. A review of financial information for interim periods consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Auditing Standards accepted in Israel. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all the significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nBasis for the Qualified Conclusion\nWe were not satisfied in regard to the approximately NIS 58 million amount of impairment of the exploration assets that was included in expenses in the Company statements of comprehensive loss for the year 2021, and in accordance, in regard to the amount of dividend in kind presented in the financial statements.\nConclusion\nBased on our review, except for the abovementioned item, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to suspect that the financial information abovementioned was not prepared, from all significant aspects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34.\nWe draw attention to:\nNote 1d of the condensed interim financial statements - the Company has accumulated losses since its inception and does not have any operations that yield revenues. Financing of its operations has, until now, been performed by infusions of capital and/or loans. The Company has plans of installation of new operations, but there is uncertainty in this regard. These facts raise significant doubt as to the continued existence of the Company as a \"going concern.\"\nThese condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the value of the assets and liabilities and their classifications that would possibly be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a \"going concern.\"\nBarzily & Co.\nCertified Public Accountants\nA Member of MSI Worldwide\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\nCONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(In NIS in thousands)\nJune 30\n,\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2021\nNote\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n228\n11\n853\nOther accounts receivable\n181\n109\n8\nTotal current assets\n409\n120\n861\nAssets for distribution to shareholders\n-\n41,620\n-\nTotal Assets\n409\n41,740\n861\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nCapital\nShare Capital\n(7,412)\n23,421\n(6,573)\nNon-current Liabilities:\nOptions convertible to shares\n-\n8\n-\nTotal Non-current Liabilities\n-\n8\n-\nCurrent Liabilities:\nShort-term credit from bank and others\n-\n358\n-\nTrade payables\n13\n310\n9\nOther accounts payable\n81\n507\n94\nLoans convertible to shares\n-\n181\n-\nLiabilities at fair value\n7,727\n7,570\n7,331\nTotal current liabilities\n7,821\n8,926\n7,434\nLiabilities for distribution to shareholders\n-\n9,385\n-\nTotal Equity and Liabilities\n409\n41,740\n861\nThe accompanying notes to these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are an integral part thereof.\nOctober 31, 2022\nDate of Approval of the Financial Statements\nAlon Shani\nCEO\nDavid Ben David, Acct.\nController\nDirector\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\n[Formerly Shefa Yamim (A.T.M.)

In the framework of these changes, the prospecting and exploration operations in search for precious stones and gold, performed by the Company from its inception until March 2022, would be transferred to its subsidiary (Shefa in Israel (G.M) Ltd., hereinafter - \"the subsidiary\").\nc.\nOn August 9, 2021 the\nspecial meeting of the Company's shareholder\napproved the agreement signed between the Company and Shani group (hereinafter \"the agreement\". This agreement includes:\nDistribution of shares of Shefa Israel (formerly \"the subsidiary)\", directly to the Company's shareholders, as a dividend in kind-\nDuring January 2021, all exploration assets and their attributed operations were transferred to Shefa Israel. As consideration, Shefa Israel allocated shares to the Company. As part as the agreement, the shares were transferred to an agreed trustee (Mr. Nathan Druckman, Adv.) in order to enable him to allocate the Subsidiary's shares on a pro-rata basis, to all the company's shareholders at the determination date (August 10, 2021). Distribution will take place as part of a dividend in-kind subject to and subsequent to approval by the Court.\nThis distribution was recorded as a dividend for distribution in the Company's financial statements.\nd.\nThe Company has accumulated losses since its inception and does not have any operations that yield revenues. Financing of its operations has, until now, been performed by infusions of capital and/or loans. The Company has plans of installation of new operations, but there is uncertainty in this regard. These facts raise significant doubt as to the continued existence of the Company as a \"going concern.\"\nThese condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the value of the assets and liabilities and their classifications that would possibly be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a \"going concern.\nSHEFA GEMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In NIS in thousands)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDeclaration in regard to Implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\na.\nThe condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting.\" The financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (hereinafter: \"the Annual Financial Statements\"). However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Company's financial position and performance since the Annual Financial Statements.\nThese financial statements were authorized by the Company's board of directors on October 31, 2022.\nForeign Currency and Linkage Basis\nb.\nDetail in regard to the change in the Consumer Price Index and the exchange rate of the foreign currency:\nFor the Period of Six Months Ended June 30,\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2021\nChange in CPI (applicable)\n3.22%\n1.59%\n2.8%\nChange in CPI (known)\n3.13%\n1.41%\n2.4%\nChange in rate of exchange - U.S. $\nChange in rate of exchange - GBP - \u00a3\n7.9%\n(6.3%)\n1.4%\n2.9%\n0.9%\n2.9%\nc.\nJudgments and Estimates\nIn preparing these Interim Financial Statements in accordance with the IFRS, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses.

Following a strategic review, it was determined that the Company could no longer justify the costs of being a listed company, and that any future funds raised on the basis of exploration activity should be entirely dedicated to the development of mining activity. On 1 June 2021, the Company announced an agreement with the \"Shany Group,\" a consortium of investors led by Mr. Alon Shany and Ms. Eva Abittan, wherein the Shany Group and other unrelated parties would pay an amount of approximately GBP 756,000 in return for a subscription to approximately 85% of the Company's issued share capital. Additionally, the Company would transfer all of its exploration and mining assets to its formerly wholly-owned subsidiary, Shefa in Israel (G.M.) Ltd (the \"Subsidiary\", a private company registered in Israel), and distribute ownership of the Subsidiary to all of the Company's existing Shareholders via a dividend\nin specie\n. The transaction was approved by the Company's shareholders on 9 August 2021.
