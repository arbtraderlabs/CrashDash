Fourth quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.66 million therms per month (up from 1.39 million therms per month in the third quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 84bbl/day, up circa 20.9% against an average of 69.5 bbl/day in the third quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency was 94% for the Quarter, up from 87% in the third quarter 2025\n.\nHigher production at Saltfleetby during the Quarter reflects increased equipment uptime, improved well performance, enhanced well management, and optimisation of Booster Compressor operations at lower wellhead pressures.\nFocus during the quarter was given to preparation for the well workovers on two of the three producing wells with detailed reviews of site readiness and workover procedures to minimise the production impact of the well interventions whilst ensuring the workovers deliver improvements in well performance.\nSuccessful Phase 1 of Saltfleetby Well Workovers\nCoil tubing operations have been successfully completed on Saltfleetby-B2 where the Company cleaned and stimulated the well with an acid and mutual solvent treatment. We are now in a flowback phase of the operation with gas, condensate and water flowing back to the production facility. Initial results are positive; however, as referenced in the initial RNS, the well requires time for production to stabilise post-workover before the full quantum of production uplift can be assessed. The workover spread has been mobilised to Saltfleetby-B7, with Phase 2 of the workover operations having commenced on 15 January 2026. As previously advised, the Company expects to be in a position to assess the results of the workovers in March following the post workover clean up phase.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 4,577 barrels in aggregate for the months of October, November and December 2025, with an average of 50 bbl/day. This is an increase of circa 26.0% compared to 3,632 barrels for the third quarter of 2025 averaging 39 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency was 99% for the Quarter, down from 100% in the third quarter. Improvements in production rates have been made through operational optimisation and a reducing water cut.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a34.12m (Quarter 3: \u00a33.21m)\n, a circa 28% increase on the third quarter due principally to higher production volumes\n.\nAs previously advised, low priced legacy hedging volumes rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volume for the quarter was 3.22 million therms at an average price of \u00a30.91 per therm, resulting in a hedging profit of \u00a30.539m during the quarter.\nFurther to previous announcements (most recently 20 November 2025), Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of the continued progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.\nThe Company's shares are expected to remain suspended from trading on AIM pending the conclusion of its financial restructuring.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

The workovers will be a coil tubing deployed wellbore clean-up in two wells to remove any additives left during the original drilling process, lift accumulated liquids within the wellbore and remediate any near wellbore damage that may have occurred naturally over time. These workovers aim to improve production and reliability from the two wells.\nDuring the workover programme production will be periodically suspended, with expected uptime at circa 90% in December 2025 and circa 60% in January 2026. The workover programme is designed over two phases, with the physical intervention followed by a clean-up period of approximately four to six weeks, before the results of the workovers can be assessed in March 2026.\nCarlos Fernandes, Finance Director comments: \"\nThe team has worked diligently on the planning of these production enhancement projects, which are fully supported by the Company's lender, Trafigura.

As a result, it introduced and opened discussions with a specialist, experienced, US-based offshore operator to take forward the operations of the project. This step enables Angus to retain potential upside from the asset while benefiting from the proposed operator's technical and operational capabilities and financial contribution.\nFollowing the progression of due diligence (and subject to the vendor providing clarification on certain outstanding items identified during the process), the Board has determined that securing a minority non-operated interest represents the most value-enhancing and risk-appropriate structure for the Company and its shareholders. This structure would allow Angus to participate in the project's potential returns with materially lower financial and human capital requirements and reduced execution risk.\nTerms are still under negotiation between the relevant parties, however, the Board notes that, should an agreement for a minority interest be reached, and subject to a number of matters, including funding, the transaction is no longer expected to be considered a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, significantly simplifying the regulatory process and reducing associated costs and timelines. A further update on the target assets and the detailed terms will be provided should we reach final agreement.\nFinance Update\nAs previously notified, while the Company continues to meet its obligations to trade creditors, it has sought to defer and restructure its arrangements with three key creditor groups where payments are currently overdue, namely the senior debt provided by Trafigura (including amounts due in relation to crystallised and other hedging arrangements), the Overriding Royalty Interest in connection with the Company's principal Saltfleetby asset and the Deferred Consideration due to Forum Energy Services Ltd. In aggregate, the total amount of debt being restructured is circa \u00a329 million.\nThe Company confirms that positive discussions with the above-mentioned creditors remain ongoing, with the preparation of long-form term sheets underway which will underpin definitive agreements with the aim of creating a solid foundation for future growth. The Board is encouraged by the progress and momentum achieved. The Board reiterates that failure to reach a suitable agreement could create material uncertainty in respect of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company will update the market once terms have been agreed. In the meantime, the Board continues to prudently manage working capital in close coordination with its lenders.\nSuspension of Trading on AIM\nThe Company's shares are expected to remain suspended from trading on AIM pending the conclusion of its financial restructuring.\nThe Board remains committed to delivering a sustainable and value-driven strategy for the Company and will provide further updates as appropriate.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

Third quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.39 million therms per month (up circa 6.9% from 1.30 million therms per month in the second quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 69.5\nbbl/day, up circa 3.7% against an average of 67 bbl/day in the second quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency remains at 87% for the Quarter.\nHigher production at Saltfleetby this quarter reflects improved well performance, improvements in well management, and optimisation of Booster Compressor operation with lower well head pressures.\nWell performance under the new operating regime of lower well head pressures continues to be evaluated by the sub-surface team and the operations team with the aim of delivering further increases in production.\nThe annual maintenance shutdown was delivered two days ahead of schedule, with four days of lost production associated with the shutdown, during the month of July. The annual shutdown was delivered without incident and with no harm to the environment, and all regulatory commitments were met.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 3,632 barrels in aggregate for the months of July, August and September 2025, with an average of 39.5 bbl/day. This is a decrease of circa 6.6% compared to 3,890 barrels for the second quarter of 2025 averaging 43 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency remained at 100% for the Quarter.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a33.21m (Quarter 2: \u00a33.44m)\n, a 7% reduction on the second quarter due principally to lower gas prices which averaged \u00a30.79 per therm (Quarter 2: \u00a30.84 per therm)\n.\nAs previously announced, low priced legacy hedging volumes rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volume for the quarter was 3,220 million therms at an average price of \u00a30.84 per therm, resulting in a hedging profit of \u00a30.152m for the quarter.\nFurther to the announcement of 13 October 2025, Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of recent progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.\nPotential Acquisition by Reverse Takeover\nFurther to the announcement of 13 October 2025, the Company is continuing with its due diligence on the purchase of a group of producing assets located in the Gulf of America. The Board is meeting in the next week to agree whether or not to proceed with the transaction as currently structured. The Company will update the market accordingly in respect of any further developments.\nManagement Update\nFurther to the announcement of 11 July 2025, and as requested by Forum Energy Services Limited (\"Forum\"), Jonathan Tidswell-Pretorius was appointed as non-board Interim COO. After completing a review of the Company's operations, Jonathan Tidswell-Pretorius has resigned to pursue other interests. On behalf of the Company the Board wishes to thank him for his guidance and efforts during this time.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.
