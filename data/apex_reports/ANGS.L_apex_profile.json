In addition, the Brockham Field exported 1,995 barrels of oil during the Quarter.\n\u00b7\nGas sales of 5.85\nmillion therms were achieved in the Quarter from the Saltfleetby Field\n\u00b7\nEstimated revenues of \u00a35.14m for the Quarter\nGas sales from the Saltfleetby Field equalled 5.85\nmillion therms in aggregate for the months of July, August and September 2024, an average of 1.95 mm therms per month. Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 109\nbbl/day. Saltfleetby operational efficiency was 88% for the quarter and 2024 YTD operational efficiency has been maintained at a high level of 90%.\nQuarterly production and operational efficiency reflects the impact of a planned full field shutdown for five days in early July.\nOil volumes produced and sold from the Brockham Field equalled 1,995 barrels in aggregate for the months of July, August and September 2024, an average of 22 barrels/day. The field is capable of producing 25-30 barrels/day from the single well on production, with the lower quarterly volume reflecting stoppages for facilities maintenance and operational improvement work.\nHedging Update\nAt the start of the third quarter 2024, the monthly volumes of gas hedged under the legacy risk management programme put in place for the redevelopment of the Saltfleetby Field in 2021-22 dropped to 1.25 million therms per month from 1.5 million therms per month in the first and second quarters. These hedges will stay at this level until they expire in June 2025. Thereafter, hedges for an additional 6.44 mm therms have been struck as detailed in the table below:\nPeriod\nAmount (therms)\nAverage price (pence/therm)\nJul 2025\n1,085,000\n84.41\nAug 2025\n1,085,000\n84.41\nSep 2025\n1,050,000\n84.41\nOct 2025\n1,085,000\n91.63\nNov 2025\n1,050,000\n91.63\nDec 2025\n1,085,000\n91.63\nTOTAL\n6,440,000\nThe Company is working closely with Trafigura Trading (Europe) Sarl (\"Trafigura\") on its existing hedging commitments, including the impact of previously crystalised hedges, and has the required flexibility under its financing facility with Trafigura to manage these commitments ahead of the installation of the booster compressor and the expiry of the legacy hedges.\n\u200b\nRichard Herbert, CEO, commented:\n\"Angus is pleased with the production from Saltfleetby during the third quarter which extends our track record of safe, reliable production. Even with the planned maintenance shutdown in July, revenues were up on stronger gas prices. Engineering work is proceeding to plan for the installation of the third compressor (the booster compressor) in late 2024-early 2025 which is expected to raise production levels and increase ultimate recovery from the field. We are also very satisfied with the performance of the Brockham Field which has now delivered 13 tanker loads of crude oil to the market since production was restarted in late May this year.\"\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nRichard Herbert\nChief Executive Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Caroline Rowe / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

These tests are ongoing, and Angus will update on progress and plans in due course.\nAs announced on 22 February 2024, Angus Energy entered into a Financing Facility with a subsidiary of Trafigura Group PTE Ltd (\"Trafigura\"). The terms of the Facility are unchanged from those of the term sheet summarised by the Company via RNS on 20 December 2023, being a 5-year loan, with a twelve-month grace period on principal repayment and then approximately even amortisation from March 2025. Production variability during the first quarter of 2025, before the booster compressor was commissioned, has resulted in the first principal repayment of \u00a31.25 million, being deferred as part of ongoing discussions with Trafigura about resculpting the repayment schedule.\nAngus remains confident in the gas reserves and potential of the Saltfleetby Field and is investigating options to increase production through workovers, new drilling as well as potential acquisitions to strengthen the financial position of the Company.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\nAngus Energy\nPlc\nRichard\nHerbert\nChief Executive\nDirector\nVia\nFlagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and\nBroker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill /\nJen Clarke\n/ Richard Hail\nTel: +44 (0)20 3470\n0470\nFlagstaff\nPR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129\n1474\nAbout Angus Energy\nplc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.
