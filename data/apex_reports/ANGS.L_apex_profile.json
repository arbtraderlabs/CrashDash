Fourth quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.66 million therms per month (up from 1.39 million therms per month in the third quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 84bbl/day, up circa 20.9% against an average of 69.5 bbl/day in the third quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency was 94% for the Quarter, up from 87% in the third quarter 2025\n.\nHigher production at Saltfleetby during the Quarter reflects increased equipment uptime, improved well performance, enhanced well management, and optimisation of Booster Compressor operations at lower wellhead pressures.\nFocus during the quarter was given to preparation for the well workovers on two of the three producing wells with detailed reviews of site readiness and workover procedures to minimise the production impact of the well interventions whilst ensuring the workovers deliver improvements in well performance.\nSuccessful Phase 1 of Saltfleetby Well Workovers\nCoil tubing operations have been successfully completed on Saltfleetby-B2 where the Company cleaned and stimulated the well with an acid and mutual solvent treatment. We are now in a flowback phase of the operation with gas, condensate and water flowing back to the production facility. Initial results are positive; however, as referenced in the initial RNS, the well requires time for production to stabilise post-workover before the full quantum of production uplift can be assessed. The workover spread has been mobilised to Saltfleetby-B7, with Phase 2 of the workover operations having commenced on 15 January 2026. As previously advised, the Company expects to be in a position to assess the results of the workovers in March following the post workover clean up phase.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 4,577 barrels in aggregate for the months of October, November and December 2025, with an average of 50 bbl/day. This is an increase of circa 26.0% compared to 3,632 barrels for the third quarter of 2025 averaging 39 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency was 99% for the Quarter, down from 100% in the third quarter. Improvements in production rates have been made through operational optimisation and a reducing water cut.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a34.12m (Quarter 3: \u00a33.21m)\n, a circa 28% increase on the third quarter due principally to higher production volumes\n.\nAs previously advised, low priced legacy hedging volumes rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volume for the quarter was 3.22 million therms at an average price of \u00a30.91 per therm, resulting in a hedging profit of \u00a30.539m during the quarter.\nFurther to previous announcements (most recently 20 November 2025), Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of the continued progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.\nThe Company's shares are expected to remain suspended from trading on AIM pending the conclusion of its financial restructuring.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

The workovers will be a coil tubing deployed wellbore clean-up in two wells to remove any additives left during the original drilling process, lift accumulated liquids within the wellbore and remediate any near wellbore damage that may have occurred naturally over time. These workovers aim to improve production and reliability from the two wells.\nDuring the workover programme production will be periodically suspended, with expected uptime at circa 90% in December 2025 and circa 60% in January 2026. The workover programme is designed over two phases, with the physical intervention followed by a clean-up period of approximately four to six weeks, before the results of the workovers can be assessed in March 2026.\nCarlos Fernandes, Finance Director comments: \"\nThe team has worked diligently on the planning of these production enhancement projects, which are fully supported by the Company's lender, Trafigura.

As a result, it introduced and opened discussions with a specialist, experienced, US-based offshore operator to take forward the operations of the project. This step enables Angus to retain potential upside from the asset while benefiting from the proposed operator's technical and operational capabilities and financial contribution.\nFollowing the progression of due diligence (and subject to the vendor providing clarification on certain outstanding items identified during the process), the Board has determined that securing a minority non-operated interest represents the most value-enhancing and risk-appropriate structure for the Company and its shareholders. This structure would allow Angus to participate in the project's potential returns with materially lower financial and human capital requirements and reduced execution risk.\nTerms are still under negotiation between the relevant parties, however, the Board notes that, should an agreement for a minority interest be reached, and subject to a number of matters, including funding, the transaction is no longer expected to be considered a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, significantly simplifying the regulatory process and reducing associated costs and timelines. A further update on the target assets and the detailed terms will be provided should we reach final agreement.\nFinance Update\nAs previously notified, while the Company continues to meet its obligations to trade creditors, it has sought to defer and restructure its arrangements with three key creditor groups where payments are currently overdue, namely the senior debt provided by Trafigura (including amounts due in relation to crystallised and other hedging arrangements), the Overriding Royalty Interest in connection with the Company's principal Saltfleetby asset and the Deferred Consideration due to Forum Energy Services Ltd. In aggregate, the total amount of debt being restructured is circa \u00a329 million.\nThe Company confirms that positive discussions with the above-mentioned creditors remain ongoing, with the preparation of long-form term sheets underway which will underpin definitive agreements with the aim of creating a solid foundation for future growth. The Board is encouraged by the progress and momentum achieved. The Board reiterates that failure to reach a suitable agreement could create material uncertainty in respect of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company will update the market once terms have been agreed. In the meantime, the Board continues to prudently manage working capital in close coordination with its lenders.\nSuspension of Trading on AIM\nThe Company's shares are expected to remain suspended from trading on AIM pending the conclusion of its financial restructuring.\nThe Board remains committed to delivering a sustainable and value-driven strategy for the Company and will provide further updates as appropriate.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

Third quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.39 million therms per month (up circa 6.9% from 1.30 million therms per month in the second quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 69.5\nbbl/day, up circa 3.7% against an average of 67 bbl/day in the second quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency remains at 87% for the Quarter.\nHigher production at Saltfleetby this quarter reflects improved well performance, improvements in well management, and optimisation of Booster Compressor operation with lower well head pressures.\nWell performance under the new operating regime of lower well head pressures continues to be evaluated by the sub-surface team and the operations team with the aim of delivering further increases in production.\nThe annual maintenance shutdown was delivered two days ahead of schedule, with four days of lost production associated with the shutdown, during the month of July. The annual shutdown was delivered without incident and with no harm to the environment, and all regulatory commitments were met.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 3,632 barrels in aggregate for the months of July, August and September 2025, with an average of 39.5 bbl/day. This is a decrease of circa 6.6% compared to 3,890 barrels for the second quarter of 2025 averaging 43 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency remained at 100% for the Quarter.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a33.21m (Quarter 2: \u00a33.44m)\n, a 7% reduction on the second quarter due principally to lower gas prices which averaged \u00a30.79 per therm (Quarter 2: \u00a30.84 per therm)\n.\nAs previously announced, low priced legacy hedging volumes rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volume for the quarter was 3,220 million therms at an average price of \u00a30.84 per therm, resulting in a hedging profit of \u00a30.152m for the quarter.\nFurther to the announcement of 13 October 2025, Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of recent progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.\nPotential Acquisition by Reverse Takeover\nFurther to the announcement of 13 October 2025, the Company is continuing with its due diligence on the purchase of a group of producing assets located in the Gulf of America. The Board is meeting in the next week to agree whether or not to proceed with the transaction as currently structured. The Company will update the market accordingly in respect of any further developments.\nManagement Update\nFurther to the announcement of 11 July 2025, and as requested by Forum Energy Services Limited (\"Forum\"), Jonathan Tidswell-Pretorius was appointed as non-board Interim COO. After completing a review of the Company's operations, Jonathan Tidswell-Pretorius has resigned to pursue other interests. On behalf of the Company the Board wishes to thank him for his guidance and efforts during this time.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

As a result, it introduced and opened discussions with a specialist, experienced, US-based offshore operator to take forward the operations of the project. This step enables Angus to retain potential upside from the asset while benefiting from the proposed operator's technical and operational capabilities and financial contribution.\nFollowing the progression of due diligence (and subject to the vendor providing clarification on certain outstanding items identified during the process), the Board has determined that securing a minority non-operated interest represents the most value-enhancing and risk-appropriate structure for the Company and its shareholders. This structure would allow Angus to participate in the project's potential returns with materially lower financial and human capital requirements and reduced execution risk.\nTerms are still under negotiation between the relevant parties, however, the Board notes that, should an agreement for a minority interest be reached, and subject to a number of matters, including funding, the transaction is no longer expected to be considered a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, significantly simplifying the regulatory process and reducing associated costs and timelines. A further update on the target assets and the detailed terms will be provided should we reach final agreement.\nFinance Update\nAs previously notified, while the Company continues to meet its obligations to trade creditors, it has sought to defer and restructure its arrangements with three key creditor groups where payments are currently overdue, namely the senior debt provided by Trafigura (including amounts due in relation to crystallised and other hedging arrangements), the Overriding Royalty Interest in connection with the Company's principal Saltfleetby asset and the Deferred Consideration due to Forum Energy Services Ltd. In aggregate, the total amount of debt being restructured is circa \u00a329 million.\nThe Company confirms that positive discussions with the above-mentioned creditors remain ongoing, with the preparation of long-form term sheets underway which will underpin definitive agreements with the aim of creating a solid foundation for future growth. The Board is encouraged by the progress and momentum achieved. The Board reiterates that failure to reach a suitable agreement could create material uncertainty in respect of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company will update the market once terms have been agreed. In the meantime, the Board continues to prudently manage working capital in close coordination with its lenders.\nSuspension of Trading on AIM\nThe Company's shares are expected to remain suspended from trading on AIM pending the conclusion of its financial restructuring.\nThe Board remains committed to delivering a sustainable and value-driven strategy for the Company and will provide further updates as appropriate.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nCarlos Fernandes\nFinance Director ",

Third quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.39 million therms per month (up circa 6.9% from 1.30 million therms per month in the second quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 69.5\nbbl/day, up circa 3.7% against an average of 67 bbl/day in the second quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency remains at 87% for the Quarter.\nHigher production at Saltfleetby this quarter reflects improved well performance, improvements in well management, and optimisation of Booster Compressor operation with lower well head pressures.\nWell performance under the new operating regime of lower well head pressures continues to be evaluated by the sub-surface team and the operations team with the aim of delivering further increases in production.\nThe annual maintenance shutdown was delivered two days ahead of schedule, with four days of lost production associated with the shutdown, during the month of July. The annual shutdown was delivered without incident and with no harm to the environment, and all regulatory commitments were met.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 3,632 barrels in aggregate for the months of July, August and September 2025, with an average of 39.5 bbl/day. This is a decrease of circa 6.6% compared to 3,890 barrels for the second quarter of 2025 averaging 43 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency remained at 100% for the Quarter.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a33.21m (Quarter 2: \u00a33.44m)\n, a 7% reduction on the second quarter due principally to lower gas prices which averaged \u00a30.79 per therm (Quarter 2: \u00a30.84 per therm)\n.\nAs previously announced, low priced legacy hedging volumes rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volume for the quarter was 3,220 million therms at an average price of \u00a30.84 per therm, resulting in a hedging profit of \u00a30.152m for the quarter.\nFurther to the announcement of 13 October 2025, Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of recent progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.\nPotential Acquisition by Reverse Takeover\nFurther to the announcement of 13 October 2025, the Company is continuing with its due diligence on the purchase of a group of producing assets located in the Gulf of America. The Board is meeting in the next week to agree whether or not to proceed with the transaction as currently structured. The Company will update the market accordingly in respect of any further developments.\nManagement Update\nFurther to the announcement of 11 July 2025, and as requested by Forum Energy Services Limited (\"Forum\"), Jonathan Tidswell-Pretorius was appointed as non-board Interim COO. After completing a review of the Company's operations, Jonathan Tidswell-Pretorius has resigned to pursue other interests.

Second quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.3mm therms per month (down circa 14% from 1.52 mm therms per month in the first quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 67\nbbl/day, down circa 18% against an average of 82 bbl/day in the first quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency was 87% for the Quarter compared to 90% for the previous Quarter.\nLower production at Saltfleetby this second quarter reflects the impact of commissioning activities, comprising short duration site outages for connecting the Booster compressor to existing site systems and infrastructure. Well testing under new operating conditions also contributed to production losses in the quarter with a three-day planned outage on all infield wells during the last week of April.\nWell performance under the new operating regime of lower well head pressures is being evaluated by the sub-surface team to enable optimisation of the infield wells and the team are examining ways to increase production.\nThe annual maintenance shutdown commenced today with a scheduled duration of six days.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 3,890 barrels in aggregate for the months of April, May and June 2025, with an average of 43 bbl/day. This is an increase of circa 80% compared to 2,150 barrels for the first quarter of 2025 averaging 24 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency was 100% for the Quarter compared to 98% for the previous Quarter. The increase in production is due to production optimisation and the increase in operating efficiencies.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a33.44m\n, a reduction on the first quarter due principally to lower gas volumes, however the company is encouraged by comparatively strong summer gas prices\n.\nAs previously announced, legacy hedging volumes of 1.25m therms per month rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volumes for the rest of 2025 is 6.370m therms or 1.062m therms per month at an average price of \u00a30.84 per therm in quarter three rising to \u00a30.91 in quarter four 2025. This represents a price increase of circa 180% and 213% respectively when compared to quarter two pricing of \u00a30.29 per therm and will provide the Company with a significant increase in operating cashflows.\nFurther to the announcement of 6 June 2025, Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with Trafigura regarding the resculpting of the original payment schedule and the potential transaction are ongoing which includes the Company's second repayment which became due as of 30 June 2025 and has also not been paid as yet.

Angus Energy operates all fields in which it has an\ninterest.\nChairman's Statement\nDear Shareholders,\nI am pleased to share with you the interim results for the six months ended 31 March 2025. First, following his resignation, tendered after the period end, the Board would like to thank Richard Herbert for his dedication and hard work in taking the Company through what has been a transformative time in its development.\nDespite delays to the installation of the Booster, the Company reported strong EBITDA for the period. The Board remains committed to unlocking the significant potential embedded in our asset base and corporate platform. Our goal is to position the Company to better weather near-term volatility while laying the foundation for sustainable long-term growth.\nAll operations were conducted without any harm to people or the environment. We have also taken proactive steps to pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. On the organic front, our technical teams have identified a number of near-field development and optimization targets within our existing portfolio that is needed to enhance production and cash flow. Concurrently, our M&A team remains active in evaluating potential transactions that are value-accretive, strategically aligned, and capable of accelerating our transformation.\nIn line with these efforts, the Company is currently assessing a potential reverse takeover (RTO) transaction. As a result, trading in our shares has been temporarily suspended in accordance with regulatory requirements. We are also engaged in active discussions with Trafigura on the restructuring of our existing debt facility. While we understand this may cause uncertainty for shareholders in the short term, we believe the RTO under consideration, along with other M&A opportunities currently under consideration, could significantly strengthen and expand our operational footprint by increasing reserves production and cashflow, and create a path toward growth and renewed shareholder value. At present, discussions pertaining to the RTO are at an early stage. The Company has signed a non-binding agreement which is subject to completion of due diligence, financing and other material considerations and there is no certainty that it will be completed.\nWe are mindful of the responsibility we owe to our shareholders and stakeholders, and I want to assure you that every effort is being made to steer Angus through this period of transition. The Board remains confident that, with discipline and strategic focus, we can emerge stronger and better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities ahead.\nNet revenue from oil and gas production during the period was \u00a311.302m on gross production of 17,361 bbls of gas condensate, 3,695 bbls of crude oil and 10.443 mm therms of natural gas as against hedged volumes of 7.5 mm therms for the period. This was the result of production from the Saltfleetby Gas Field and the Brockham Oil Field. Average sales prices achieved during the period were \u00a335.18/bbls for gas condensate, \u00a357.58/bbls for crude oil and \u00a31.00/therm for natural gas.\nThe Group recorded ",

The transaction diversifies Angus away from the challenging UK energy sector into assets in a highly supportive oil and gas jurisdiction, with stable and reliable production and low decline.\nAs part of the acquisition and reverse takeover process, approval of the Company's shareholders in a General Meeting will be required under the AIM Rules. As such, a further announcement with full details of the transaction will be issued at the appropriate time once binding contracts are entered into and an admission document published and sent to shareholders with a notice of general meeting.\nThe Company is working towards finalising the asset purchase agreement and further details and timing will be communicated in due course.\nAt this stage, the Potential Transaction is non-binding and subject to completing due diligence, funding and other material considerations and there is no certainty that it will be completed, and the timing thereof cannot be determined.\nIn accordance with Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, the Company's shares have been suspended from trading on AIM with effect from today. The Company's ordinary shares will remain suspended until such time as either an admission document is published, or an announcement is released confirming that the transaction is not proceeding.\nShareholders should be aware that there is a risk that admission of the Company's securities could be cancelled if they have been suspended from trading for six months.\nFinance Update\nFurther to the announcement of 7 May 2025, Angus Energy confirms that while resculpting discussions are ongoing, Trafigura has granted the Company an extension of the first principal repayment until 26 May 2025.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\nAngus Energy\nPlc\nRichard\nHerbert\nChief Executive\nDirector\nVia\nFlagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and\nBroker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill /\nJen Clarke\n/ Richard Hail\nTel: +44 (0)20 3470\n0470\nFlagstaff\nPR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129\n1474\nAbout Angus Energy\nplc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

These tests are ongoing, and Angus will update on progress and plans in due course.\nAs announced on 22 February 2024, Angus Energy entered into a Financing Facility with a subsidiary of Trafigura Group PTE Ltd (\"Trafigura\"). The terms of the Facility are unchanged from those of the term sheet summarised by the Company via RNS on 20 December 2023, being a 5-year loan, with a twelve-month grace period on principal repayment and then approximately even amortisation from March 2025. Production variability during the first quarter of 2025, before the booster compressor was commissioned, has resulted in the first principal repayment of \u00a31.25 million, being deferred as part of ongoing discussions with Trafigura about resculpting the repayment schedule.\nAngus remains confident in the gas reserves and potential of the Saltfleetby Field and is investigating options to increase production through workovers, new drilling as well as potential acquisitions to strengthen the financial position of the Company.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\nAngus Energy\nPlc\nRichard\nHerbert\nChief Executive\nDirector\nVia\nFlagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and\nBroker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill /\nJen Clarke\n/ Richard Hail\nTel: +44 (0)20 3470\n0470\nFlagstaff\nPR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129\n1474\nAbout Angus Energy\nplc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

The compressor operates at a lower suction pressure than the two existing compressors at the field, allowing more pressure drawdown of the wells and helping to alleviate the impact of liquid loading in the wells, which has been increasingly impacting gas flow rates in the last three months. The introduction of the booster compressor has resulted in an 18% increase in production compared with the average production for the first 10 days of March and a 15% increase compared to average daily production in March. Work is continuing to optimise plant and well performance with the new compressor, with the aim of further improving and stabilising gas flow rates from the three wells in the field.\nProduction and Operations Update\nGas sales from the Saltfleetby Field equalled 4.55\nmillion therms in aggregate for the months of January, February and March 2025, compared to 5.73 million therms sold in the fourth quarter of 2024. First quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.52mm therms per month (1.91 mm therms per month in the fourth quarter of 2024). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 82\nbbl/day, against an average of 102 bbl/day in the fourth quarter 2024. Saltfleetby operational efficiency was 90% for the Quarter compared to 94% for the previous Quarter. Brockham operational efficiency was 98% for the Quarter compared to 90% for the previous Quarter.\nLower production at Saltfleetby this first quarter reflects the impact of cold weather on well and plant performance in January and the increasing effect of liquids, mainly condensate, restricting gas flow in the 3 wells in the field. The introduction of the booster compressor will reduce well head pressures and increase gas flow rates and gas velocities from each of the wells and assist in the lifting of liquids to surface and improve the stability of production.\nEstimated revenues of \u00a35.21m are down c.15% compared to third quarter revenues of \u00a36.12m\n, with lower gas volumes being partially offset by higher gas prices over the winter months\n. As previously announced, legacy hedging volumes will remain at 1.25m therms per month until they roll off in June 2025.\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 2,150 barrels in aggregate for the months of January, February and March 2025, an average of 24 bbl/day, compared to 2,130 barrels for the fourth quarter of 2024 averaging 23 bbl/day.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nRichard Herbert\nChief Executive Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

Angus is the leading onshore gas producer in the UK and has ambitious plans to grow onshore production and diversify internationally. Angus Energy has a 100% interest in the Saltfleetby Gas Field (PEDL005), majority owns and operates conventional oil production fields at Brockham (PL 235) and Lidsey (PL 241) and has a 25% interest in the Balcombe Licence (PEDL244). Angus Energy operates all fields in which it has an\ninterest.\nChairman's statement\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nIt is my pleasure to present you with the Annual Report of Angus Energy plc (the \"Company\" or \"Angus Energy\") with its subsidiary undertakings (the \"Group\") for the year ended 30 September 2024.\nDuring the year, we focused on maximizing revenue, refinancing of the Company's debt, improving operational efficiency, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. There has also been a strong focus on organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Our dedication to sustainable practices, combined with a strong commitment to shareholder returns, positions us well for future success.\nAngus has delivered strong revenue of \u00a321.802 million and EBITDA of \u00a310.803 million. Historic hedges, set at less than 50% of current spot gas prices which stop in June 2025, will lead to a substantial improvement in cashflow and overall profits going forwards.\nIn February 2024, we successfully closed a \u00a320m senior secured loan facility provided by Trafigura PTE Ltd. This allowed the company to exit its previous expensive debt and provided funds to pay legacy creditors and invest in a booster compressor to increase gas production from Saltfleetby Field in Lincolnshire and to restart oil production from the Brockham Oil Field in Southern England.\nOperationally, we have maintained steady gas production at Saltfleetby and work on the installation of the booster compressor is progressing with commissioning expected in late first quarter of 2025. The new compressor is planned to boost production and prolong the life of the field.\nIn line with this strategy, we have completed the geological remapping of the Saltfleetby Gas Field, enabling us to produce an updated dynamic reservoir model calibrated with production history data. With this data we are able to select the best targets for infill drilling opportunities to accelerate production. Geologically the Saltfleetby Gas Field also has gas storage potential and has been identified as the best hydrogen storage reservoir candidate onshore in the UK and 3rd best, including offshore fields. Energy security is high on the Government's agenda, and we will continue to work with all stakeholders to assess the viability of storage opportunities covering hydrogen (production and storage) and carbon capture schemes.\nTo complement Angus's organic growth, we have created a strong team to look at inorganic opportunities and are in the process of identifying targets, mergers and development candidates. This will be a strong theme for 2025.\nFinancial and Statutory Information\nRevenue from oil and gas production during the year were \u00a321.802m (2023: \u00a328.208m) on production of gross 44 mbbls of condensate oil, 2.6 kbbls of crude oil and 26.5 million therms of natural gas (2023: 32 kbbls of condensate oil, NIL crude oil and 25 million therms of natural gas).

In addition, the Brockham Field produced 2,130 barrels of crude oil during the Quarter.\n\u00b7\nGas sales of 5.73\nmillion therms were achieved in the Quarter from the Saltfleetby Field.\n\u00b7\nEstimated revenues of \u00a36.12m for the Quarter.\n\u00b7\nBooster compressor shipped from the USA and expected to arrive on site during January 2025.\nGas sales from the Saltfleetby Field equalled 5.73\nmillion therms in aggregate for the months of October, November and December 2024, compared to 5.85 million therms sold in the third quarter of 2024. Fourth quarter production equates to an average of 1.91mm therms per month (1.95 mm therms per month in the third quarter of 2024). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 102\nbbl/day, against an average of 109 bbl/day in the third quarter 2024. Quarterly production reflects an improvement in plant uptime at Saltfleetby, with operational efficiency of 94% for the Quarter compared to 92% for the year, offsetting natural well decline.\nEstimated revenues of \u00a36.12m are up c.19% compared to third quarter revenues of \u00a35.14m, primarily due to increased gas prices over the winter months. As previously announced, legacy hedging volumes, which are priced materially lower than current spot pricing, will remain at 1.25m therms per month until they roll off at the end of June 2025.\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 2,130 barrels in aggregate for the months of October, November and December 2024, an average of 23 bbl/day, compared to 1,995 for the third quarter of 2024 averaging 22 bbl/day. The field is capable of producing at a daily rate of 20-30 barrels from the single well on production, with the average quarterly volume reflecting stoppages for facilities maintenance and operational improvement work.\nBooster Compressor Update\nThe new booster compressor was shipped from the USA in December 2024 and is scheduled to arrive in the UK in the next two weeks. It will be transported to Saltfleetby for installation and commissioning, with start-up planned for late first Quarter 2025. This compressor is planned to increase production through the ability to operate within a greater pressure range and will increase the ultimate recovery of gas from the reservoir.\nRoyalty Interest\nAs announced on 22 February 2024 at the time of Angus's financial restructuring, there is an agreement with the royalty interest holders that until the end of the Second Quarter 2025, the royalty interest can either be settled in cash or through the issue of new ordinary shares in the Company at the Company's option. Under existing arrangements and calculation methods the Company is required to issue 183,595,230 shares (or cash equivalent) in aggregate in settlement of the Q2 and Q3 2024 royalty interest. Angus intends to negotiate the timing of the settlement with the royalty interest holders and will provide an update accordingly.\nEND\nFor further information please visit\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nAngus Energy Plc\nRichard Herbert\nChief Executive Director Via Flagstaff\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nomad and Broker)\nwww.spangel.co.uk\nStuart Gledhill / Jen Clarke / Richard Hail Tel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nFlagstaff PR/IR\nangus@flagstaffcomms.com\nTim Thompson / Fergus Mellon / Alison Alfrey Tel: +44 (0) 207 129 1474\nAbout Angus Energy plc\nAngus Energy plc is a UK AIM quoted independent oil and gas company.

A copy of the Circular is also available from the Company's website,\nwww.angusenergy.co.uk\n.\nExtracts from the Circular are set out below including the background:\nGeneral Meeting\n1. Introduction\nOn 22 February 2024, Angus Energy PLC (the \"\nCompany\n\") announced that, further to agreeing terms with a subsidiary of Trafigura Group PTE Ltd (\"\nTrafigura\n\") for a refinancing of its existing debt, it has signed definitive loan documentation which allowed it to draw down in full on the \u00a320 million loan facility (the \"\nFacility\n\") with Trafigura (the \"\nAnnouncement\n\"). The existing senior debt of \u00a34.56 million was transferred to Trafigura, and the proceeds of the Facility will be applied to repay the bridge facility of \u00a36 million (the \"\nBridge Facility\n\"), and \u00a31.75 million of the original \u00a36.25 million deferred consideration due to Forum Energy Services Limited (\"\nForum\n\") from the sale of Saltfleetby Energy Limited's 49% interest in the Saltfleetby Field to the Company in 2022 (the \"\nSaltfleetby Sale\n\"). The balance of funds from the Facility will be used to pay legacy creditors and invest in wells and equipment to increase gas production from Saltfleetby and restart oil production from the Brockham Field in Southern England.\nRevenue Share Agreements\nAs part of the senior debt facility secured in 2021 to redevelop the Saltfleetby Field, under separate revenue share agreements (the \"\nRevenue Share Agreements\n\") made on 17 May 2021 with, among others, (1) Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. (\"\nMercuria\n\"), (2) Aleph Saltfleetby Ltd (\"\nAleph Saltfleetby\n\") and (3) Aleph Energy Ltd (\"\nAleph\n\") (together the \"\nRoyalty Holders\n\") the Company acquired commitments to pay royalties to the lenders from the three current producing wells on repayment of that part of the debt associated with the construction of field facilities.\nUnder deeds of variation to the Revenue Share Agreements (the \"\nDeeds of Variation\n\"), each entered into on 22 February 2024, it has been agreed with the Royalty Holders that, until June 2025, the respective royalties due under the Revenue Share Agreements will be settled either in cash or through the issue of new ordinary shares of \u00a30.002 each in the capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") at a 15% discount to the 30 day volume weighted average price.\nForum\nUnder the terms of a deed entered into on 22 February 2024 between, among others, Forum and the Company (the \"\nForum Deed\n\"), it has been agreed to vary the terms of the Saltfleetby Sale such that, of the remaining deferred consideration:\n\u00a3400,000 is due on 30 June 2024;\nfurther payments of \u00a3300,000 each are due on each calendar quarter from and including 30 September 2024 to and including 31 March 2025; and\nthe balance of \u00a31,586,705 is due on 30 June 2025.\nUnder the terms of the Forum Deed, should the Company fail to make any of the above cash payments, Forum can instead elect to receive such payment in new Ordinary Shares issued at a 15% discount to the 30 day volume weighted average price.\nFee agreement\nUnder the terms of an agreement made on 22 February 2024 between (1) the Company, (2) Aleph Commodities Limited (\"\nACL\n\") and (3) Aleph Finance Limited (\"\nAFL\n\") (the \"\nACL and AFL Agreement\n\"):\n(a) ACL will receive a fee for structuring and assistance in securing the Facility of \u00a3750,000, to be satisfied by the issue of 187,500,000 new Ordinary Shares at 0.40 pence per share;\nAFL, as the provider of the Bridge Facility, will receive in aggregate \u00a3256,052, to be satisfied by the issue of 64,013,000 new Ordinary Shares to ACL at 0.40 pence per share; and\na further amount of new Ordinary Shares representing accrued interest will be issued to ACL.\nIn order to enable it to issue all the various new Ordinary Shares under the various arrangements described above, the Company is required to increase its Directors' authorities, which requires the approval of the shareholders of the Company at a general meeting.\n2. General Meeting\nYou will find at the end of this document a notice convening the General Meeting, to be held at Fieldfisher's offices, 9th Floor",

Fourth quarter 2025 production equates to an average of 1.66 million therms per month (up from 1.39 million therms per month in the third quarter of 2025). Gas condensate (liquid) production averaged 84bbl/day, up circa 20.9% against an average of 69.5 bbl/day in the third quarter 2025. Saltfleetby operational efficiency was 94% for the Quarter, up from 87% in the third quarter 2025\n.\nHigher production at Saltfleetby during the Quarter reflects increased equipment uptime, improved well performance, enhanced well management, and optimisation of Booster Compressor operations at lower wellhead pressures.\nFocus during the quarter was given to preparation for the well workovers on two of the three producing wells with detailed reviews of site readiness and workover procedures to minimise the production impact of the well interventions whilst ensuring the workovers deliver improvements in well performance.\nSuccessful Phase 1 of Saltfleetby Well Workovers\nCoil tubing operations have been successfully completed on Saltfleetby-B2 where the Company cleaned and stimulated the well with an acid and mutual solvent treatment. We are now in a flowback phase of the operation with gas, condensate and water flowing back to the production facility. Initial results are positive; however, as referenced in the initial RNS, the well requires time for production to stabilise post-workover before the full quantum of production uplift can be assessed. The workover spread has been mobilised to Saltfleetby-B7, with Phase 2 of the workover operations having commenced on 15 January 2026. As previously advised, the Company expects to be in a position to assess the results of the workovers in March following the post workover clean up phase.\nBrockham\nOil volumes produced from the Brockham Field equalled 4,577 barrels in aggregate for the months of October, November and December 2025, with an average of 50 bbl/day. This is an increase of circa 26.0% compared to 3,632 barrels for the third quarter of 2025 averaging 39 bbl/day. Brockham operational efficiency was 99% for the Quarter, down from 100% in the third quarter. Improvements in production rates have been made through operational optimisation and a reducing water cut.\nFinance Update\nEstimated revenues during the quarter were \u00a34.12m (Quarter 3: \u00a33.21m)\n, a circa 28% increase on the third quarter due principally to higher production volumes\n.\nAs previously advised, low priced legacy hedging volumes rolled off in June 2025. Hedged volume for the quarter was 3.22 million therms at an average price of \u00a30.91 per therm, resulting in a hedging profit of \u00a30.539m during the quarter.\nFurther to previous announcements (most recently 20 November 2025), Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of the continued progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in co",

Further to previous announcements (most recently 20 November 2025), Angus Energy confirms that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing. While the Board is encouraged in respect of the continued progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.",

Consider they had nowt left in the pot after the 12 month grace period, and royalties etc were paid with confetti not revenues, and the booster compressor works were covered by the Trafi loan. That translated to the revenue generated during the 12 month grace period WAS just enough to cover Opex and their Hobnob stash, so breakeven without debt to pay for. Come on,, give it a go,,, tell us what you think they will need to produce to be a \"going concern\" and honour their debts ?? and I will be generous to you in that you can use 100p for your gas price.",

While the Board is encouraged in respect of the continued progress in these discussions, the Company cautions that if a suitable agreement is not reached, it would create a material uncertainty around the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company will inform the market once an agreement has been reached and the terms of such agreement, and in the meantime continues to carefully manage its working capital position in conjunction with its lenders.",

There has also been positive early results from the coil tubing deployed wellbore clean-up campaign in two wells to remove additives left during the original drilling process, lift accumulated liquids in the wellbore and remediate near wellbore damage that has occurred naturally over time. Angus is also continuing efforts to consolidate and refinance the existing debt facilities with its main creditors, in order to better position the balance sheet to raise new capital in support of organic growth, increased production, and potential M&A activity. While the proposed asset transaction is no longer expected to be considered a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules for Companies, the shares will remain suspended pending the conclusion of the Company\u2019s financial restructuring.

I remain majorly surprised that these refinancing negotiations have so far taken over 8 months (and counting).

However, if we do take the missing July and August hedged amounts (total 6.76mmscf) and spilt it over Jan- March 2023 then this increases the hedge volume for each month from 5.38 to 7.63. This then means that the hedge generates \u00a33.7 million for the quarter and the unhedged value is \u00a319 million. So even if Angus paid the entire missing July and August hedge off in Q1 2023 then they would still make a total of \u00a322.6 million. At 14 mmscfd it simply doesn\u2019t matter what needs to be paid off when, the money is there to do it easily.",

As indicated previously the company have been working on operational efficiency and this has been reflected in \u2018increased equipment uptime, improved well performance, enhanced well management and optimisation of Booster Compressor operations at lower wellhead pressures\u2019. In addition the work continues on well workovers in order to minimise any production impact caused by such interventions but that will deliver overall improvements in operational efficiency. With a gain of \u00a3539/- from hedging giving revenue estimates of some \u00a34.12m the sum gain is good and increased production at Brockham also helps. The company also say that \u2018positive discussions with its creditors and that positive discussions with its creditors regarding restructuring of its debt remain ongoing\u2019. They also warn that if a suitable agreement is not reached it would \u2018create a material uncertainty around the Company\u2019s ability to continue to operate as a going concern\u2019 which is a clear analysis for all concerned. With the operational outlook looking very positive and the natural gas price giving a fair wind it seems that with continued demand for gas at least the short term is actually looking good for Angus.",

Just to be clear after giving out todays Q4 numbers we now have the figures available for the whole of 2025: Natural gas production: 1,582 million scf Gas condensate production: 27,768 barrels Crude oil production: 14,249 barrels Estimated total revenue: \u00a316.09m So your claim is that Angus need to produce: 3 million scf of natural gas 55,000 barrels of condensate 28,000 barrels oil And an estimated total revenue of \u00a332 million just to break even? This seems utterly ludicrous to me and reflects very badly on both your research and intellect. But I guess everybody is entitled to an opinion lol!",

GreyPanther Posts: 818 Price: 0.96 No Opinion RE: market sentiment beginning to change?               03 Jul 2021 16:46 Hi there gkb47. For me the jury is still out on whether the re-development of this nearly depleted gas field will be a technical, let alone a commercial success. It might, of course, be rescued by a rising UK gas price, which would be very good news for all our shareholders. Regarding the pros and cons of sidetracking either SF 5 or SF7, I wasn't able to find nearly enough detailed geological / well logging info on UKOGL's website to help me with this. For example, I still don't know which of the many fairly thin reservoir sands have already been depleted in various areas of the field, nor which reservoirs are locally or maybe more regionally absent. The most telling fact for me is that SF5 has never been sidetracked (were the results of that well simply too disappointing?) but SF7 has been sidetracked four times as 7Z, 7X, 7Y and 7W. I don't know in which order these were drilled, or what their bottom hole locations were, but it doesn't seem to me that many - if any - of the results were much good. I heard that Roc pulled out of the UK and out of SF in a bit of a hurry. I believe Wintershall and others then picked SF up but soon dropped it when their gas storage plans failed to gain approval. If they couldn't make a go of it, I'd be worried that the Angus technical team may not have the skills, or maybe the luck, to do any better than their much better qualified predecessors. However, I could easily be proved wrong; it won't be the first time!\"",

This then slowly chokes off the free gas from escaping past the liquids to flow to surface, a bit like the cream sitting on top of the milk, so unless you remove the liquids capping the gas, then it is effectively dead. They have ZERO means of artificially building the reservoir pressure up as is often done in many oil fields, simply by re injecting gas back into the formation, as this is a gas field, so the ONLY action they can take to sustain production is simply to follow the old school ways of lifting as much liquids out with the gas as possible ALL THE TIME, as pressure in a producing field is always in decline.",

I am still of the very string opinion that we will resist very soon with a deal on the debt that is much more favourable than previously.  The lender is supporting and their priority is clear. If they can get 30-40% uplift from workover then you will see debt paid down quite quickly.  On top they have amassed a decent cash pile since the lender allowed them to hold payments during the restructure discussion.  In a very good position to maximise what sounds like a good opportunity in the Gulf of America and, of course, to drill another well which will increase the recoverable gas from the field.

Installing the booster and dropping the flowing pressure more only induces greater fluids to be created, thus why they are forced into doing what they are doing now, but that will need a more permanent solution, not a quick draining of banked liquids and flow again, as it will simply slowly build back up, and the more the natural reservoir pressure depletes, then the more it will also induce. It isn't a shortage of gas that kills such fields, it is near always liquids.",

Add to that, what will likely happen if they are \"only\" draining the liquids now, and not installing any form of velocity string as a more long term future liquids evacuation method, will result in a likely short term uplift in surface flow rates, but not significantly greater, that will then fairly quickly re induce liquids and banking of liquids to choke back the flow AGAIN.. only a little worse each time. If they do flow through any form of coil velocity string, then it will almost certainly NOT see an increase in flow/production, the velocity string will simply just mean most liquids induced from flowing will flush out to surface, but the overall gas to surface will be less per day, but will extend the flowing life far longer. The reality is that SLBY will continue, but only as the repayment facility for Trafigura, and retail will see NADA,, simply because it is not capable of producing more than what it takes to maintain the field opex and pay back a much larger loan (due to the default), that will likely be set at a repayment rate to match the found optimum production level after this workover.

THE only people that will lose are retail, even the shower that run this outfit have not lost, they still get paid, they have taken their bite out of this apple a long time ago, thus UNDERMINING the asset value through insanely bad deals, poor operational practices, massive, MASSIVE overspends on anything they touch etc etc etc,,, and the swill trough brigade who helped dilute this into the multi BILLIONS in issue",

Aside from back and forward about debt and default, what are you expecting as an outcome of the debt restructure, and subsequent relisting? I believe terms are done / almost done for the lender to service the entire \u00a329m debt and the cash pile amassed will stay with ANGS.  All conjecture as we don\u2019t know how many millions they built up and whether workover is debt or cash funded, nor do we know cost of workover.  However we will have cash in bank guaranteed, a workover highly likely to be successful and hence much improved revenue, a new manageable debt programme then a future ahead. None of us can work the exact numbers but I see a rerating, upwards, on relist which will of course be clarified once we see production boost and debt terms.  Side shows are the Gulf of America deal and forward plan on additional well(s). I cannot think of any possible scenario where retail suffer.",

It should have and could have easily done 5-10p back in the early SLBY days, but as said, they couldn't stop themselves..... As for any current monies in the pot, that Trafigura might say keep hold off (lol), well if their drilling costs and management are anything to go by, then I expect they will make sure this consumes any funds available. Also there is a building pile of royalties to pay that are also in default, so they will likely again pass that on in shares so it screws retail AGAIN,,, or it will need to be paid in cash...

Prior to suspension they showed almost no funds in the pot, now remember they were paying royalties via shares/dilution, so no cash, they stated the booster etc was to be funded from the original trafi loan, AND they had a 12 month grace period of no repayment on the main Trafi debt pile. yet they had no funds left in the pot after the 12 month grace period. SO if they cannot even bank enough to cover Opex and what was a modest debt repayment plan prior to suspension, then HOW the ferk do you think they gonna do that now lol..... AND have excess for anything else plus some retail upside lolololol.... They are royally ferked,,,, and the ONLY outcome is Trafi & the others set it up to ensure they keep getting some payments, with a little to keep the lights on and nowt else left in the pot.........

During suspension, revenues were constrained while fixed costs, legacy creditor balances and one-off items (including workover costs) still existed \u2014 that tells us very little about run-rate economics once production is stabilised. Using a suspension period as proof that a producing asset can never generate surplus cash is not a serious argument. Post-restart, the model changes materially: \u2022 royalties are no longer paid in shares \u2022 production volumes are higher than pre-suspension \u2022 pricing is materially stronger than during much of the prior period \u2022 capex is largely sunk rather than ongoing \u2022 debt servicing profiles are negotiated around cash flow, not hindsight optics Trafigura and other counterparties are not charities, but they also don\u2019t structure deals designed to kill the underlying asset. Their incentive is continued production and repayment, not terminal starvation. If the asset genuinely had no path to surplus cash, restructuring would already have happened. Retail \u201cupside\u201d isn\u2019t the driver here \u2014 asset cash generation and balance sheet repair are. Whether that ultimately translates into equity value is a separate question, but dismissing the entire recovery thesis based on a suspension-era cash snapshot is simply not rigorous analysis. Time will answer it either way, but the argument needs to be grounded in forward operating reality, not frustration with the past.",

How does it help Angus if royalties are no longer paid in shares? It merely results in bigger cash losses. 3. Production volumes were higher in the second quarter than in the first. Turnover was significantly lower. 4. Workovers are capex. 5. Yes, debt servicing depends on positive cash flow. Cash flow doesn\u2019t appear to be improving. I can\u2019t see anything in your post that suggests things are improving. Trafigura has its own reasons for keeping this going but, as others have pointed out, there appears to be nothing in this for small shareholders.",

Okay, I never agreed with his views, but they were both reasoned and well expressed. However, he's now living proof that being trapped in the ANGS lobsterpot is clearly not good for one's sanity. He's apparently convinced himself (or been convinced) that there's a nefarious bunch of posters criticising ANGS for some mysterious agenda (as he says, \"we all know\")... but has completely fled to recognise that a critical view of ANGS has been justified by subsequent reality literally every single time. And of course, just because the cold, hard reality of things eternally runs entirely counter to the narrative that cheerleaders wish for in no way stops it from being the cold, hard reality of things. But it then gets even more bizarre (if syuch a thing were possible). Crocqman asks : \"But, interest rates dropped after October (in Dec) when we had a last proper update, with a split decision to drop again in Jan, and with consolidation you would surely expect to see better terms with one finance deal than with several existing deals, otherwise why would you consolidate?\" I mean, could things be misframed any more hugely? ANGS absolutely isn't contemplating whether it should consolidate its debts or not. Instead (as has been announced more than once via RNS) it has failed to meet its contractually enshrined payment terms - I won't use the entirely apposite \"D\" word, because it gets the pompom wavers all discombobulated. Ergo as anyone still retaining even a vague grasp on reality is totally aware, ANGS, being unable to meet the contractual terms of the financing to which it has currently signed up, has its begging bowl out. It is entirely at the mercy of its senior creditors - to the extent that its continued existence entirely depends upon the latter agreeing to new financing terms - and it will have to bend over and accept any terms that said creditors decide to impose. Why anyone would think such terms would be more lenient towards ANGS than the current ones that they have been unable to abide by, God only knows. Separately, I entirely agree that there is no longer any valid reason why ANGS shares should remain in suspension. The almost certainly mythical and convenient RTO has been confirmed as utterly off the table. Continuing cack-handed management of debt is no reason to allow suspension for any listed company - so the shares should have immediately come out of suspension as soon as the RTO was confirmed as being dead. That would then allow the cheerleaders to load up as they keep bleating they want to) and also enable those looking to escape from the ANGS lobsterpot with at least something. Everyone's a winner, eh? It won't happen of course (as per PPP as Mirasol pointed out) but that doesn't stop the ongoing suspension from being an unjustifiable disgrace.",

My view has always been that new financing will be made available - but at less favourable terms, because the creditors will want more certainty on getting paid back - and more reward for taking what is clearly an enhanced risk, given ANGS's failure to meet any of the terms of the originally advanced financing. That's just commercial common sense. The above clearly shows that the creditors consider enabling ANGS to continue to be the best hope for repayment. Also, the fact that the creditors have not forced foreclosure (which they happily could have) strongly suggests that the asset value of Saltfleetby, title over the licence to which was provided as security against the original loan, is not as high as many of the pompom wavers would have everybody believe. Otherwise Trafigura et al. could have happily acquired that via foreclosure and flogged it, thus ensuring they got their capital and interest back. This is not cherry picking negatives at all - it's extrapolating from the available facts. Oh - and the fact that ANGS shares are still suspended, despite the alleged RTO having been announced as dead in the water remains a disgrace.",

They use their city mates to raise cash with vast amounts of dilution, pump & dump on a giagntic sale and then the use of the Pensions Fund to keep control when things started to get a bit rough.  They've also avoided piling up debts to outsiders which has been the downfall of ANGS.  It's all paper than swills around between HHDL, UKOG and the others. Looking back the time the Fench came in and then exited quickly should have warned us all.  They clearly didn't like what they saw and I suspect the Board were s*** scared they'd stay and then pull the rug from under the incumbents.  The non-exec's have been a silent joke.",

There\u2019s been a bit of softness in the most recent days, but the 30-day running average at around 0.126 mmscfd still looks solid and broadly in line with the ~60% January expectation \u2026.. For me, it\u2019s less about any single day and more about the overall trend and improving consistency \u2026.. It suggests the ongoing work is starting to show through, with optimisation still in progress rather than complete \u2026.. If this continues and the current programme plays out as expected, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see sentiment start to shift \u2026..

GreyPanther Posts: 818 Price: 0.96 No Opinion RE: market sentiment beginning to change?               03 Jul 2021 16:46 Hi there gkb47. For me the jury is still out on whether the re-development of this nearly depleted gas field will be a technical, let alone a commercial success. It might, of course, be rescued by a rising UK gas price, which would be very good news for all our shareholders. Regarding the pros and cons of sidetracking either SF 5 or SF7, I wasn't able to find nearly enough detailed geological / well logging info on UKOGL's website to help me with this. For example, I still don't know which of the many fairly thin reservoir sands have already been depleted in various areas of the field, nor which reservoirs are locally or maybe more regionally absent. The most telling fact for me is that SF5 has never been sidetracked (were the results of that well simply too disappointing?) but SF7 has been sidetracked four times as 7Z, 7X, 7Y and 7W. I don't know in which order these were drilled, or what their bottom hole locations were, but it doesn't seem to me that many - if any - of the results were much good. I heard that Roc pulled out of the UK and out of SF in a bit of a hurry. I believe Wintershall and others then picked SF up but soon dropped it when their gas storage plans failed to gain approval. If they couldn't make a go of it, I'd be worried that the Angus technical team may not have the skills, or maybe the luck, to do any better than their much better qualified predecessors. However, I could easily be proved wrong; it won't be the first time!\"",

This then slowly chokes off the free gas from escaping past the liquids to flow to surface, a bit like the cream sitting on top of the milk, so unless you remove the liquids capping the gas, then it is effectively dead. They have ZERO means of artificially building the reservoir pressure up as is often done in many oil fields, simply by re injecting gas back into the formation, as this is a gas field, so the ONLY action they can take to sustain production is simply to follow the old school ways of lifting as much liquids out with the gas as possible ALL THE TIME, as pressure in a producing field is always in decline.",

I am still of the very string opinion that we will resist very soon with a deal on the debt that is much more favourable than previously.  The lender is supporting and their priority is clear. If they can get 30-40% uplift from workover then you will see debt paid down quite quickly.  On top they have amassed a decent cash pile since the lender allowed them to hold payments during the restructure discussion.  In a very good position to maximise what sounds like a good opportunity in the Gulf of America and, of course, to drill another well which will increase the recoverable gas from the field.

Installing the booster and dropping the flowing pressure more only induces greater fluids to be created, thus why they are forced into doing what they are doing now, but that will need a more permanent solution, not a quick draining of banked liquids and flow again, as it will simply slowly build back up, and the more the natural reservoir pressure depletes, then the more it will also induce.

Add to that, what will likely happen if they are \"only\" draining the liquids now, and not installing any form of velocity string as a more long term future liquids evacuation method, will result in a likely short term uplift in surface flow rates, but not significantly greater, that will then fairly quickly re induce liquids and banking of liquids to choke back the flow AGAIN.. only a little worse each time. If they do flow through any form of coil velocity string, then it will almost certainly NOT see an increase in flow/production, the velocity string will simply just mean most liquids induced from flowing will flush out to surface, but the overall gas to surface will be less per day, but will extend the flowing life far longer. The reality is that SLBY will continue, but only as the repayment facility for Trafigura, and retail will see NADA,, simply because it is not capable of producing more than what it takes to maintain the field opex and pay back a much larger loan (due to the default), that will likely be set at a repayment rate to match the found optimum production level after this workover.

All conjecture as we don\u2019t know how many millions they built up and whether workover is debt or cash funded, nor do we know cost of workover.  However we will have cash in bank guaranteed, a workover highly likely to be successful and hence much improved revenue, a new manageable debt programme then a future ahead. None of us can work the exact numbers but I see a rerating, upwards, on relist which will of course be clarified once we see production boost and debt terms.  Side shows are the Gulf of America deal and forward plan on additional well(s). I cannot think of any possible scenario where retail suffer.",

This SLBY project HAD all the hallmarkings o potentially be a small company maker, IF it was managed well from the start, AND they DID have a decent plan at the start, but greed got to a few and then it was simply a race to drain the asset value/undermine it with really bad debt decisions, dilution enough to sink the Titanic, hedges so bad that it both cost them a fortune and lost them a fortune...stupid life royalty deals for their mates at the time, Forrest is probably the one who on a personal level made the most from this sheite show.... It should have and could have easily done 5-10p back in the early SLBY days, but as said, they couldn't stop themselves..... As for any current monies in the pot, that Trafigura might say keep hold off (lol), well if their drilling costs and management are anything to go by, then I expect they will make sure this consumes any funds available. Also there is a building pile of royalties to pay that are also in default, so they will likely again pass that on in shares so it screws retail AGAIN,,, or it will need to be paid in cash... AND Forrestgate is still open for his payout too,,, It is likely there is a coil tubing draining operation heading to the cashpot as we speak................",

Prior to suspension they showed almost no funds in the pot, now remember they were paying royalties via shares/dilution, so no cash, they stated the booster etc was to be funded from the original trafi loan, AND they had a 12 month grace period of no repayment on the main Trafi debt pile. yet they had no funds left in the pot after the 12 month grace period. SO if they cannot even bank enough to cover Opex and what was a modest debt repayment plan prior to suspension, then HOW the ferk do you think they gonna do that now lol..... AND have excess for anything else plus some retail upside lolololol.... They are royally ferked,,,, and the ONLY outcome is Trafi & the others set it up to ensure they keep getting some payments, with a little to keep the lights on and nowt else left in the pot......... THAT is the reality........",

During suspension, revenues were constrained while fixed costs, legacy creditor balances and one-off items (including workover costs) still existed \u2014 that tells us very little about run-rate economics once production is stabilised. Using a suspension period as proof that a producing asset can never generate surplus cash is not a serious argument. Post-restart, the model changes materially: \u2022 royalties are no longer paid in shares \u2022 production volumes are higher than pre-suspension \u2022 pricing is materially stronger than during much of the prior period \u2022 capex is largely sunk rather than ongoing \u2022 debt servicing profiles are negotiated around cash flow, not hindsight optics Trafigura and other counterparties are not charities, but they also don\u2019t structure deals designed to kill the underlying asset. Their incentive is continued production and repayment, not terminal starvation. If the asset genuinely had no path to surplus cash, restructuring would already have happened. Retail \u201cupside\u201d isn\u2019t the driver here \u2014 asset cash generation and balance sheet repair are. Whether that ultimately translates into equity value is a separate question, but dismissing the entire recovery thesis based on a suspension-era cash snapshot is simply not rigorous analysis. Time will answer it either way, but the argument needs to be grounded in forward operating reality, not frustration with the past.",

How does it help Angus if royalties are no longer paid in shares? It merely results in bigger cash losses. 3. Production volumes were higher in the second quarter than in the first. Turnover was significantly lower. 4. Workovers are capex. 5. Yes, debt servicing depends on positive cash flow. Cash flow doesn\u2019t appear to be improving. I can\u2019t see anything in your post that suggests things are improving. Trafigura has its own reasons for keeping this going but, as others have pointed out, there appears to be nothing in this for small shareholders.",

Okay, I never agreed with his views, but they were both reasoned and well expressed. However, he's now living proof that being trapped in the ANGS lobsterpot is clearly not good for one's sanity. He's apparently convinced himself (or been convinced) that there's a nefarious bunch of posters criticising ANGS for some mysterious agenda (as he says, \"we all know\")... but has completely fled to recognise that a critical view of ANGS has been justified by subsequent reality literally every single time. And of course, just because the cold, hard reality of things eternally runs entirely counter to the narrative that cheerleaders wish for in no way stops it from being the cold, hard reality of things. But it then gets even more bizarre (if syuch a thing were possible). Crocqman asks : \"But, interest rates dropped after October (in Dec) when we had a last proper update, with a split decision to drop again in Jan, and with consolidation you would surely expect to see better terms with one finance deal than with several existing deals, otherwise why would you consolidate?\" I mean, could things be misframed any more hugely? ANGS absolutely isn't contemplating whether it should consolidate its debts or not. Instead (as has been announced more than once via RNS) it has failed to meet its contractually enshrined payment terms - I won't use the entirely apposite \"D\" word, because it gets the pompom wavers all discombobulated. Ergo as anyone still retaining even a vague grasp on reality is totally aware, ANGS, being unable to meet the contractual terms of the financing to which it has currently signed up, has its begging bowl out. It is entirely at the mercy of its senior creditors - to the extent that its continued existence entirely depends upon the latter agreeing to new financing terms - and it will have to bend over and accept any terms that said creditors decide to impose. Why anyone would think such terms would be more lenient towards ANGS than the current ones that they have been unable to abide by, God only knows. Separately, I entirely agree that there is no longer any valid reason why ANGS shares should remain in suspension. The almost certainly mythical and convenient RTO has been confirmed as utterly off the table. Continuing cack-handed management of debt is no reason to allow suspension for any listed company - so the shares should have immediately come out of suspension as soon as the RTO was confirmed as being dead. That would then allow the cheerleaders to load up as they keep bleating they want to) and also enable those looking to escape from the ANGS lobsterpot with at least something. Everyone's a winner, eh? It won't happen of course (as per PPP as Mirasol pointed out) but that doesn't stop the ongoing suspension from being an unjustifiable disgrace.",

My view has always been that new financing will be made available - but at less favourable terms, because the creditors will want more certainty on getting paid back - and more reward for taking what is clearly an enhanced risk, given ANGS's failure to meet any of the terms of the originally advanced financing. That's just commercial common sense. The above clearly shows that the creditors consider enabling ANGS to continue to be the best hope for repayment. Also, the fact that the creditors have not forced foreclosure (which they happily could have) strongly suggests that the asset value of Saltfleetby, title over the licence to which was provided as security against the original loan, is not as high as many of the pompom wavers would have everybody believe. Otherwise Trafigura et al. could have happily acquired that via foreclosure and flogged it, thus ensuring they got their capital and interest back. This is not cherry picking negatives at all - it's extrapolating from the available facts. Oh - and the fact that ANGS shares are still suspended, despite the alleged RTO having been announced as dead in the water remains a disgrace.",

I honestly forget if there are any other large sums owed - I may well have forgotten remaining amounts to settle previous hedge contracts - but let's go with the \u00a334 million above as a starting point. So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over. Without knowing that stuff, any speculation is pointless.",

It is in everyone\u2019s interest to resolve this and we now have the magic factor of significant production increase and much higher gas prices.

They rant with such passion, but as you listen to what they say it becomes increasingly clear that there is simply no reason nor logic behind the words and they are, in fact, quite insane. Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics. The sword of Damocles hangs over your head due to your own outrageous claims and the hair holding it is going to break sooner or later. When it does I will be here laughing. Tik tok\u2026",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either! In Summary, If you give AI all the information it needs to give you a more rounded less rose tinted wearing outlook it will give you a very different answer.",

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

This isn't exported in lorries but in a long pipeline to a refinery which is miles from the site.  It's been there for 20 years.   The pipeline is BURIED underground and is not visible. Do keep up!

That doesn\u2019t make the facts that are disclosed meaningless\u2026. \u00a330m total debt is a fact\u2026. the workover being funded from cash is a fact\u2026. materially higher production post-workover is a fact\u2026. lower opex versus last year is a fact\u2026. and legacy hedges rolling off into a stronger pricing environment is also a fact\u2026. You keep saying \u201cno facts\u201d while ignoring the ones that don\u2019t fit your narrative\u2026. then you fall back on history as if companies are not allowed to change trajectory after restructuring\u2026. that\u2019s analysis anchored in the past, not what\u2019s happening now\u2026. No one here is claiming RNSs tell the entire story\u2026. but they don\u2019t need to\u2026. what matters is direction of travel, and that direction has clearly improved compared with where Angus was heading into default last year\u2026. Cash generation improving, costs down, production up, and debt being restructured at lower rates is not a \u201cwet dream\u201d\u2026. it\u2019s a stabilisation phase\u2026. and stabilisation is exactly what precedes rerating in situations like this\u2026. You\u2019re free to remain sceptical\u2026. but dismissing every positive development as fiction doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026. it just means you\u2019re choosing not to engage with the facts that are already on the table\u2026.",

Calling the recent production uplift a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d ignores the fact that Saltfleetby has always been capable of higher rates once constraints were addressed\u2026. the latest RNS confirms a material improvement following the workover, not some cosmetic bounce\u2026. On the share count point, yes there are a lot of shares in issue\u2026. that\u2019s already well known and fully reflected in the price\u2026. what changes outcomes isn\u2019t the historical capital structure, it\u2019s cash generation and balance sheet repair, and that\u2019s exactly where things are improving\u2026. As for the \u201cnew well\u201d scepticism, nobody is pretending it\u2019s risk-free or imminent tomorrow\u2026. the point is that higher current production and stronger margins give Angus options they simply didn\u2019t have before\u2026. optionality matters when a company is coming out of a stressed period\u2026. You also keep anchoring to falling gas prices as if that\u2019s a certainty\u2026. prices fluctuate, but Angus is producing now, into a materially better pricing environment than most of 2024, with legacy hedges rolling off and a much leaner cost base\u2026. that combination is what improves margins, not a single headline price\u2026. No one sensible is saying this is a guaranteed straight line to \u00a37\u201310m per quarter overnight\u2026. what\u2019s being said is that the trajectory has changed\u2026. higher production, better realised prices, lower costs and active restructuring are all moving in the right direction\u2026. That\u2019s progress\u2026. and it\u2019s exactly what you want to see from a company that\u2019s been in suspension and is working its way back\u2026.",

I wouldn't trust them to drill a hole in a wall to hang a picture, never mind a completely \"new\" well, AND there is by no means a guarantee anything they drill will find anything of commercial value, AND if they hit the existing reservoir, then it too will simply face depleted low pressures and induced liquids.

Market Tailwinds: The expiration of low-priced legacy hedges in mid-2025 and recent peaks in UK gas prices (100.10 p/therm in Jan 2026) have significantly improved Angus Energy's operating margins. Operational Progress: A fourth production well at Saltfleetby is planned for Q1 2026, which could further boost output by 2\u20136 mmcf/d.",

The latest RNS shows production has increased materially post-workover, which directly strengthens the company\u2019s ability to satisfy creditor requirements and move toward resolution of outstanding reporting and governance matters\u2026. Higher production at current gas prices isn\u2019t hypothetical \u2014 it\u2019s a current operational fact being reported to the market\u2026. That means stronger cash generation and a far better starting point than the flat-lined or declining production people here keep assuming\u2026. Even if gas prices moderate from current highs, improved production and lower costs still provide significantly more operational cash than before\u2026. That\u2019s exactly the sort of fundamental improvement that de-risks suspension outcomes\u2026. Using worst-case reservoir decline and short \u201choneymoon\u201d narratives as if they\u2019re the only possible trajectory ignores the actual RNS figures\u2026. No one is saying suspension should be lifted instantly, but the business is making measurable progress toward the thresholds that ultimately do matter in those suspension reviews\u2026.",

First, the latest RNS didn\u2019t just point to a modest 15\u201320% uplift \u2014 it reported a material increase in production, well ahead of that range. That tells you optimisation is already delivering more than the low expectations you\u2019re anchoring to\u2026.. Second, no one has claimed the current intervention is a \u201cpermanent fix\u201d in isolation. It\u2019s one step in a wider optimisation programme. Coil tubing, acidisation, flowback management and drawdown control are standard tools to reset well performance and maximise near-term cash generation \u2014 which is exactly what Angus needs right now\u2026.. The key point you keep overlooking is that Angus no longer requires a perfect reservoir outcome. Higher production today at current gas prices materially improves cash flow, strengthens the balance sheet, and changes the dynamics with creditors. That alone reduces risk versus the situation twelve months ago\u2026.. As for gas prices, yes they fluctuate \u2014 but the company is producing now into a stronger pricing environment, not modelling distant hypotheticals. Cash in the bank today matters more than speculative decline curves six months out\u2026.. Could production moderate over time? Of course. But starting from a significantly higher base, with ongoing optimisation and lower costs, puts Angus in a far better position than the \u201cinevitable failure\u201d scenario you keep repeating\u2026.. The latest RNS shows progress, not deterioration. Ignoring that and defaulting to worst-case outcomes doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually being reported\u2026..",

At this early stage of optimisation, seeing output at these levels is encouraging. No one is claiming this is the final stabilised rate, but starting from a much higher base fundamentally improves the economics. Even a moderation from recent highs still leaves production well ahead of where Angus was operating previously\u2026.. Crucially, the company no longer needs heroic assumptions. Higher production at current gas prices translates into strong near-term cash generation, covering opex and materially strengthening the balance sheet. That shifts discussions with creditors and lenders onto far firmer ground than last year\u2026.. Yes, reservoir management and decline are always factors, but optimisation is ongoing and the field is delivering today. The narrative that this is all temporary or destined to fail doesn\u2019t align with the actual data being released\u2026.. Momentum matters. Rising production, improving cash flow, lower costs, and restructuring discussions backed by operational progress are exactly what the market needs to see. If this trajectory continues, the outlook looks meaningfully better than the constant worst-case scenarios being repeated here\u2026..",

This will continue and can only get worse as you produce more and the reservoir pressure continues to drop. If they have only done a simple acid wash (which appears to be the case) all they've done is to clean up some of the pathways inbetweeen the rock grains near the well bore.  That should lead to a short-term uptick in gas production as gas  will be able to flow more easily to the well.  However it doesn't change the physics.    Fluids will continue to drop out, and if they pull too hard that will eventually totally impede any gas flow.  The well will choke itself to death.  Even a new well will suffer the same problems - unless they can identify a part of the field that has so far been untapped and has near original pressures.  There is zero evidence that this is the case or  that  ANGS have the knowledge or ability to identify such an area should it exist.",

BUT from what they HAVE supplied, it pretty much indicates that they are NOT installing velocity strings as part of the workover, it is JUST a simple coil tubing intervention, to pump acid and then to flow out wellbore and near wellbore BANKED liquids and backflow the acid cleanup fluids. Once this has been flushed out, it appears the wells will simply go back on to production as before. WHICH is sheite, because it WILL result in simply inducing MORE liquids and the choking off of free gas continues... So expect an uplift in overall production, of around 15-20% overall, with a short honeymoon period, before a slow continued decline due to those liquids accumulating. Ultimately, it will not bring in the production needed to bail this shower out of the defaulted debt sinkhole they are in, unless gas prices rally and stay at 150p +, which is ALSO unlikely as demand season is quickly coming to an end !!",

Now I know you're desperate to promote an alternate reality, Onetomany - but frantically squeaking that the numbers are incorrect just because reality doesn't mesh with your pompom waving does not change the nature of reality one tiny bit. But okay, I'll play along... presuming Trafigura does agree to the refinancing (and I believe they will, though the terms are not going to be pleasant), how many tens of millions of pounds do you reckon will now need to be refinanced?",

I honestly forget if there are any other large sums owed - I may well have forgotten remaining amounts to settle previous hedge contracts - but let's go with the \u00a334 million above as a starting point. So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over.

They rant with such passion, but as you listen to what they say it becomes increasingly clear that there is simply no reason nor logic behind the words and they are, in fact, quite insane. Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics.

We KNOW they had spunked pretty much all of their revenues at the end of the generous grace period, which can ONLY be put down to almost all consumed on basic OPEX, \u00a33711 MILLION / 24 months = an OPEX cash burn of \u00a31.54 MILLION/Month. STAGGERING !!! When you look at the Quarterlies do you not find it ODD that when the generous grace period ended, it oddly aligned with the monthly revenues dropping from above \u00a35m per quarter to the lowly 3's  hmmmmmmmmmm looks very orchestrated to me, or you could align it to the Booster that is supposed to BOOST revenues & production, but in reality it crashed it and is struggling to recover,, YOU DECIDEEEE !!!

Obviously this shower were in SUCH a good position that they had to cry a suspension to save their souls, and many, many months later there is STILL no fix to this problem, surely if it was all so rosy and revenues could easily manage the debt then firstly it would never have happened like this, and secondly a correction deal could have been sorted pretty sharpish... unfortunately it is teetering and will likely continue just as PPP is doing, while retail sit here and can do nowt !!!",

Ultimately Trafigura are the offtake too, so it isn't like they can't see the sales revenue, and I am sure if they really wanted to, they could probably force some form of legal first dibs and simply give a small % of what remains to keep this shower running the field \"for THEM\"",

Ohhhh and you are spouting on about higher gas sales etc,,, LETS not forget what was previously posted, in the 24 months prior to suspension, the first 12 months of them were AT much higher rates and revenue was much higher, BUT unfortunately it STILL resulted in nada in the bank just prior to suspension, therefore as SAID numerous times, they NEED to double production to give you even a slight chance of some upside... and that is as likely as Trafigura writing off the debt.......",

          "content": "A lot of the negativity in this thread relies on ignoring what Angus has actually reported via RNS and instead repeating worst-case assumptions as if they are facts. Saltfleetby is a producing UK gas field generating real revenue today, not a hypothetical asset or a story stock \u2026.. The most recent updates confirmed materially higher gas sales in Q4 2025, with revenue north of \u00a34m for the quarter. This came from improved uptime and optimisation, not a one-off spike. Production has stabilised and that directly improves cash generation, which is the only thing that ultimately matters \u2026.. Legacy low-price hedges have now largely rolled off, meaning a much greater proportion of production is being sold at prevailing market prices. Valuing the field as if those old hedges are permanent is simply outdated. Margins today are meaningfully better than they were even six months ago \u2026.. Claims that the company has \u201cno cash\u201d or \u201cno options\u201d also ignore the fact that Angus has been operating for an extended period with limited capex while creditor discussions continue. Lenders are rational actors and benefit far more from supporting a producing asset than forcing failure. That reality is why restructuring talks are ongoing \u2026.. Finally, writing off Saltfleetby as having no future value beyond immediate production shows a lack of perspective. Depleted gas fields with infrastructure and grid access have strategic importance in the UK. Whether people like management or not is irrelevant \u2014 the asset has value, and the current market price reflects sentiment, not fundamentals \u2026..",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either!

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either! In Summary, If you give AI all the information it needs to give you a more rounded less rose tinted wearing outlook it will give you a very different answer.",

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

This isn't exported in lorries but in a long pipeline to a refinery which is miles from the site.  It's been there for 20 years.   The pipeline is BURIED underground and is not visible. Do keep up!  And check with Mrs Ocelot before posting absolute drivel or it's back to the nursery class for you",

That doesn\u2019t make the facts that are disclosed meaningless\u2026. \u00a330m total debt is a fact\u2026. the workover being funded from cash is a fact\u2026. materially higher production post-workover is a fact\u2026. lower opex versus last year is a fact\u2026. and legacy hedges rolling off into a stronger pricing environment is also a fact\u2026. You keep saying \u201cno facts\u201d while ignoring the ones that don\u2019t fit your narrative\u2026. then you fall back on history as if companies are not allowed to change trajectory after restructuring\u2026. that\u2019s analysis anchored in the past, not what\u2019s happening now\u2026. No one here is claiming RNSs tell the entire story\u2026. but they don\u2019t need to\u2026. what matters is direction of travel, and that direction has clearly improved compared with where Angus was heading into default last year\u2026. Cash generation improving, costs down, production up, and debt being restructured at lower rates is not a \u201cwet dream\u201d\u2026. it\u2019s a stabilisation phase\u2026. and stabilisation is exactly what precedes rerating in situations like this\u2026. You\u2019re free to remain sceptical\u2026. but dismissing every positive development as fiction doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026. it just means you\u2019re choosing not to engage with the facts that are already on the table\u2026.",

Calling the recent production uplift a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d ignores the fact that Saltfleetby has always been capable of higher rates once constraints were addressed\u2026. the latest RNS confirms a material improvement following the workover, not some cosmetic bounce\u2026. On the share count point, yes there are a lot of shares in issue\u2026. that\u2019s already well known and fully reflected in the price\u2026. what changes outcomes isn\u2019t the historical capital structure, it\u2019s cash generation and balance sheet repair, and that\u2019s exactly where things are improving\u2026. As for the \u201cnew well\u201d scepticism, nobody is pretending it\u2019s risk-free or imminent tomorrow\u2026. the point is that higher current production and stronger margins give Angus options they simply didn\u2019t have before\u2026. optionality matters when a company is coming out of a stressed period\u2026. You also keep anchoring to falling gas prices as if that\u2019s a certainty\u2026. prices fluctuate, but Angus is producing now, into a materially better pricing environment than most of 2024, with legacy hedges rolling off and a much leaner cost base\u2026. that combination is what improves margins, not a single headline price\u2026. No one sensible is saying this is a guaranteed straight line to \u00a37\u201310m per quarter overnight\u2026. what\u2019s being said is that the trajectory has changed\u2026. higher production, better realised prices, lower costs and active restructuring are all moving in the right direction\u2026. That\u2019s progress\u2026. and it\u2019s exactly what you want to see from a company that\u2019s been in suspension and is working its way back\u2026.",

I wouldn't trust them to drill a hole in a wall to hang a picture, never mind a completely \"new\" well, AND there is by no means a guarantee anything they drill will find anything of commercial value, AND if they hit the existing reservoir, then it too will simply face depleted low pressures and induced liquids.

First, the latest RNS didn\u2019t just point to a modest 15\u201320% uplift \u2014 it reported a material increase in production, well ahead of that range. That tells you optimisation is already delivering more than the low expectations you\u2019re anchoring to\u2026.. Second, no one has claimed the current intervention is a \u201cpermanent fix\u201d in isolation. It\u2019s one step in a wider optimisation programme. Coil tubing, acidisation, flowback management and drawdown control are standard tools to reset well performance and maximise near-term cash generation \u2014 which is exactly what Angus needs right now\u2026.. The key point you keep overlooking is that Angus no longer requires a perfect reservoir outcome. Higher production today at current gas prices materially improves cash flow, strengthens the balance sheet, and changes the dynamics with creditors. That alone reduces risk versus the situation twelve months ago\u2026.. As for gas prices, yes they fluctuate \u2014 but the company is producing now into a stronger pricing environment, not modelling distant hypotheticals. Cash in the bank today matters more than speculative decline curves six months out\u2026.. Could production moderate over time? Of course. But starting from a significantly higher base, with ongoing optimisation and lower costs, puts Angus in a far better position than the \u201cinevitable failure\u201d scenario you keep repeating\u2026.. The latest RNS shows progress, not deterioration. Ignoring that and defaulting to worst-case outcomes doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually being reported\u2026..",

At this early stage of optimisation, seeing output at these levels is encouraging. No one is claiming this is the final stabilised rate, but starting from a much higher base fundamentally improves the economics. Even a moderation from recent highs still leaves production well ahead of where Angus was operating previously\u2026.. Crucially, the company no longer needs heroic assumptions. Higher production at current gas prices translates into strong near-term cash generation, covering opex and materially strengthening the balance sheet. That shifts discussions with creditors and lenders onto far firmer ground than last year\u2026.. Yes, reservoir management and decline are always factors, but optimisation is ongoing and the field is delivering today. The narrative that this is all temporary or destined to fail doesn\u2019t align with the actual data being released\u2026.. Momentum matters. Rising production, improving cash flow, lower costs, and restructuring discussions backed by operational progress are exactly what the market needs to see.

This will continue and can only get worse as you produce more and the reservoir pressure continues to drop. If they have only done a simple acid wash (which appears to be the case) all they've done is to clean up some of the pathways inbetweeen the rock grains near the well bore.  That should lead to a short-term uptick in gas production as gas  will be able to flow more easily to the well.  However it doesn't change the physics.    Fluids will continue to drop out, and if they pull too hard that will eventually totally impede any gas flow.  The well will choke itself to death.  Even a new well will suffer the same problems - unless they can identify a part of the field that has so far been untapped and has near original pressures.  There is zero evidence that this is the case or  that  ANGS have the knowledge or ability to identify such an area should it exist.",

          "content": "\"\"Does this intervention not provide a permanent solution to flushing out the liquids?\"\" The problem with the information this shower of sheite provides, is that it is very limited on detail. BUT from what they HAVE supplied, it pretty much indicates that they are NOT installing velocity strings as part of the workover, it is JUST a simple coil tubing intervention, to pump acid and then to flow out wellbore and near wellbore BANKED liquids and backflow the acid cleanup fluids. Once this has been flushed out, it appears the wells will simply go back on to production as before. WHICH is sheite, because it WILL result in simply inducing MORE liquids and the choking off of free gas continues... So expect an uplift in overall production, of around 15-20% overall, with a short honeymoon period, before a slow continued decline due to those liquids accumulating. Ultimately, it will not bring in the production needed to bail this shower out of the defaulted debt sinkhole they are in, unless gas prices rally and stay at 150p +, which is ALSO unlikely as demand season is quickly coming to an end !!",

If he's ignored his world would crumble. Belittling people on this board so in his head he feels superior. He'll say filter me but its a comical read how he throws a line with a baited hook then peaters people to answer him so he gets his daily relevance boost. We all know he's got bugger all going on in his life. And before ya say it BP, this kerlown isn't filtering ya or answering ya, just making an observation \ud83e\udd14",

It owes PF around \u00a32 million for the original SFBY purchase. It owes Mercuria and Aleph around \u00a33 million on the eternal 8% ORRI that it's also never paid to date. I honestly forget if there are any other large sums owed - I may well have forgotten remaining amounts to settle previous hedge contracts - but let's go with the \u00a334 million above as a starting point. So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over. Without knowing that stuff, any speculation is pointless.",

It is in everyone\u2019s interest to resolve this and we now have the magic factor of significant production increase and much higher gas prices.

They rant with such passion, but as you listen to what they say it becomes increasingly clear that there is simply no reason nor logic behind the words and they are, in fact, quite insane. Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics. The sword of Damocles hangs over your head due to your own outrageous claims and the hair holding it is going to break sooner or later. When it does I will be here laughing. Tik tok\u2026",

We KNOW they had spunked pretty much all of their revenues at the end of the generous grace period, which can ONLY be put down to almost all consumed on basic OPEX, \u00a33711 MILLION / 24 months = an OPEX cash burn of \u00a31.54 MILLION/Month. STAGGERING !!! When you look at the Quarterlies do you not find it ODD that when the generous grace period ended, it oddly aligned with the monthly revenues dropping from above \u00a35m per quarter to the lowly 3's  hmmmmmmmmmm looks very orchestrated to me, or you could align it to the Booster that is supposed to BOOST revenues & production, but in reality it crashed it and is struggling to recover,, YOU DECIDEEEE !!! However, regardless of the DEFAULT, that is a HUGE amount of money squandered on what exactly ??? \u00a337.11 MILLION",

No capital or interest repayments required in Year One. 20 quarterly capital repayments of \u00a31.25m required starting end Mar 2025. Interest rate of 12% per annum (SONIA + 8%). We know that no capital repayments were made at either Mar 25 or Jun 25, because ANGS didn't have the cash at the time. So after  Year One (the grace year) ANGS would have owed \u00a320m of capital and \u00a32.23m of interest, totalling \u00a322.23m pounds. Presuming they've so far paid nothing back, \u00a322.23m over now four years will attract 16 quarterly repayments of \u00a31.39m plus a total of \u00a35.87m of interest, totalling \u00a328m.",

This application has now been approved, and we are awaiting imminent formal validation. Once received, the Company will progress to test the integrity of the well in readiness for future production, confirm the operability of the currently installed artificial lift, and establish the re-instatement production potential of the X2 well. This is low-cost operation, and if successful, it will allow for the reinstatement of the site with produced water trucked to Brockham for injection.",

Near term US weather forecasts turned milder, reducing heating demand and allowing more gas to flow to LNG export plants, improving the outlook for deliveries to Europe and the UK. The UK remains highly sensitive due to limited storage capacity and heavy reliance on imports, making it vulnerable to regional and global supply pressures. Geopolitical risk premiums also faded after US President Donald Trump said Washington is in talks with Iran, easing fears of disruptions to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz. Still, underlying vulnerability remains, with EU gas storage at just 41.1% full and UK storage around 36.9%. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uk-natural-gas",

If the figures are low this week it's a fact - and there is nothing you or I or God in his heaven can do about it.   :(((((((((( I didn't make any comments about \"lower production\" because we all know they forecast them when they announced the work over. and intervention.  We will not get a good idea of the effects (good, bad or so-so) until end March. \"During the workover programme production will be periodically suspended, with expected uptime at circa 90% in December 2025 and circa 60% in January 2026. The workover programme is designed over two phases, with the physical intervention followed by a clean-up period of approximately four to six weeks, before the results of the workovers can be assessed in March 2026.\" Which seems reasonable to me - and of course things slip so they move a bit to the right. If you could resist ramping a couple of days high figures you wouldn't look so silly when reality intrudes.",

Obviously this shower were in SUCH a good position that they had to cry a suspension to save their souls, and many, many months later there is STILL no fix to this problem, surely if it was all so rosy and revenues could easily manage the debt then firstly it would never have happened like this, and secondly a correction deal could have been sorted pretty sharpish... unfortunately it is teetering and will likely continue just as PPP is doing, while retail sit here and can do nowt !!!",

Ultimately Trafigura are the offtake too, so it isn't like they can't see the sales revenue, and I am sure if they really wanted to, they could probably force some form of legal first dibs and simply give a small % of what remains to keep this shower running the field \"for THEM\"",

Saltfleetby is a producing UK gas field generating real revenue today, not a hypothetical asset or a story stock \u2026.. The most recent updates confirmed materially higher gas sales in Q4 2025, with revenue north of \u00a34m for the quarter. This came from improved uptime and optimisation, not a one-off spike. Production has stabilised and that directly improves cash generation, which is the only thing that ultimately matters \u2026.. Legacy low-price hedges have now largely rolled off, meaning a much greater proportion of production is being sold at prevailing market prices. Valuing the field as if those old hedges are permanent is simply outdated. Margins today are meaningfully better than they were even six months ago \u2026.. Claims that the company has \u201cno cash\u201d or \u201cno options\u201d also ignore the fact that Angus has been operating for an extended period with limited capex while creditor discussions continue. Lenders are rational actors and benefit far more from supporting a producing asset than forcing failure. That reality is why restructuring talks are ongoing \u2026.. Finally, writing off Saltfleetby as having no future value beyond immediate production shows a lack of perspective. Depleted gas fields with infrastructure and grid access have strategic importance in the UK. Whether people like management or not is irrelevant \u2014 the asset has value, and the current market price reflects sentiment, not fundamentals \u2026..",

The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either! In Summary, If you give AI all the information it needs to give you a more rounded less rose tinted wearing outlook it will give you a very different answer.",

This isn't exported in lorries but in a long pipeline to a refinery which is miles from the site.  It's been there for 20 years.   The pipeline is BURIED underground and is not visible. Do keep up!

RNSs are not meant to read like investor presentations or broker models\u2026. they are regulatory disclosures, and by design they don\u2019t include forward guidance, speculative cash forecasts, or granular commercial negotiations\u2026. That doesn\u2019t make the facts that are disclosed meaningless\u2026. \u00a330m total debt is a fact\u2026. the workover being funded from cash is a fact\u2026. materially higher production post-workover is a fact\u2026. lower opex versus last year is a fact\u2026. and legacy hedges rolling off into a stronger pricing environment is also a fact\u2026. You keep saying \u201cno facts\u201d while ignoring the ones that don\u2019t fit your narrative\u2026. then you fall back on history as if companies are not allowed to change trajectory after restructuring\u2026. that\u2019s analysis anchored in the past, not what\u2019s happening now\u2026. No one here is claiming RNSs tell the entire story\u2026. but they don\u2019t need to\u2026. what matters is direction of travel, and that direction has clearly improved compared with where Angus was heading into default last year\u2026. Cash generation improving, costs down, production up, and debt being restructured at lower rates is not a \u201cwet dream\u201d\u2026. it\u2019s a stabilisation phase\u2026. and stabilisation is exactly what precedes rerating in situations like this\u2026. You\u2019re free to remain sceptical\u2026. but dismissing every positive development as fiction doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026. it just means you\u2019re choosing not to engage with the facts that are already on the table\u2026.",

Calling the recent production uplift a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d ignores the fact that Saltfleetby has always been capable of higher rates once constraints were addressed\u2026. the latest RNS confirms a material improvement following the workover, not some cosmetic bounce\u2026. On the share count point, yes there are a lot of shares in issue\u2026. that\u2019s already well known and fully reflected in the price\u2026. what changes outcomes isn\u2019t the historical capital structure, it\u2019s cash generation and balance sheet repair, and that\u2019s exactly where things are improving\u2026. As for the \u201cnew well\u201d scepticism, nobody is pretending it\u2019s risk-free or imminent tomorrow\u2026. the point is that higher current production and stronger margins give Angus options they simply didn\u2019t have before\u2026. optionality matters when a company is coming out of a stressed period\u2026. You also keep anchoring to falling gas prices as if that\u2019s a certainty\u2026. prices fluctuate, but Angus is producing now, into a materially better pricing environment than most of 2024, with legacy hedges rolling off and a much leaner cost base\u2026. that combination is what improves margins, not a single headline price\u2026. No one sensible is saying this is a guaranteed straight line to \u00a37\u201310m per quarter overnight\u2026. what\u2019s being said is that the trajectory has changed\u2026. higher production, better realised prices, lower costs and active restructuring are all moving in the right direction\u2026. That\u2019s progress\u2026. and it\u2019s exactly what you want to see from a company that\u2019s been in suspension and is working its way back\u2026.",

I wouldn't trust them to drill a hole in a wall to hang a picture, never mind a completely \"new\" well, AND there is by no means a guarantee anything they drill will find anything of commercial value, AND if they hit the existing reservoir, then it too will simply face depleted low pressures and induced liquids. I certainly would not agree they are capable or have the potential to see \u00a37m per quarter, the ONLY way that could happen is if gas prices were notably higher than the end of demand season shows today, and it is already struggling to hold 100p.",

First, the latest RNS didn\u2019t just point to a modest 15\u201320% uplift \u2014 it reported a material increase in production, well ahead of that range. That tells you optimisation is already delivering more than the low expectations you\u2019re anchoring to\u2026.. Second, no one has claimed the current intervention is a \u201cpermanent fix\u201d in isolation. It\u2019s one step in a wider optimisation programme. Coil tubing, acidisation, flowback management and drawdown control are standard tools to reset well performance and maximise near-term cash generation \u2014 which is exactly what Angus needs right now\u2026.. The key point you keep overlooking is that Angus no longer requires a perfect reservoir outcome. Higher production today at current gas prices materially improves cash flow, strengthens the balance sheet, and changes the dynamics with creditors. That alone reduces risk versus the situation twelve months ago\u2026.. As for gas prices, yes they fluctuate \u2014 but the company is producing now into a stronger pricing environment, not modelling distant hypotheticals. Cash in the bank today matters more than speculative decline curves six months out\u2026.. Could production moderate over time? Of course. But starting from a significantly higher base, with ongoing optimisation and lower costs, puts Angus in a far better position than the \u201cinevitable failure\u201d scenario you keep repeating\u2026.. The latest RNS shows progress, not deterioration. Ignoring that and defaulting to worst-case outcomes doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually being reported\u2026..",

At this early stage of optimisation, seeing output at these levels is encouraging. No one is claiming this is the final stabilised rate, but starting from a much higher base fundamentally improves the economics. Even a moderation from recent highs still leaves production well ahead of where Angus was operating previously\u2026.. Crucially, the company no longer needs heroic assumptions. Higher production at current gas prices translates into strong near-term cash generation, covering opex and materially strengthening the balance sheet. That shifts discussions with creditors and lenders onto far firmer ground than last year\u2026.. Yes, reservoir management and decline are always factors, but optimisation is ongoing and the field is delivering today. The narrative that this is all temporary or destined to fail doesn\u2019t align with the actual data being released\u2026.. Momentum matters. Rising production, improving cash flow, lower costs, and restructuring discussions backed by operational progress are exactly what the market needs to see. If this trajectory continues, the outlook looks meaningfully better than the constant worst-case scenarios being repeated here\u2026..",

This will continue and can only get worse as you produce more and the reservoir pressure continues to drop. If they have only done a simple acid wash (which appears to be the case) all they've done is to clean up some of the pathways inbetweeen the rock grains near the well bore.  That should lead to a short-term uptick in gas production as gas  will be able to flow more easily to the well.  However it doesn't change the physics.    Fluids will continue to drop out, and if they pull too hard that will eventually totally impede any gas flow.  The well will choke itself to death.  Even a new well will suffer the same problems - unless they can identify a part of the field that has so far been untapped and has near original pressures.

BUT from what they HAVE supplied, it pretty much indicates that they are NOT installing velocity strings as part of the workover, it is JUST a simple coil tubing intervention, to pump acid and then to flow out wellbore and near wellbore BANKED liquids and backflow the acid cleanup fluids. Once this has been flushed out, it appears the wells will simply go back on to production as before. WHICH is sheite, because it WILL result in simply inducing MORE liquids and the choking off of free gas continues... So expect an uplift in overall production, of around 15-20% overall, with a short honeymoon period, before a slow continued decline due to those liquids accumulating. Ultimately, it will not bring in the production needed to bail this shower out of the defaulted debt sinkhole they are in, unless gas prices rally and stay at 150p +, which is ALSO unlikely as demand season is quickly coming to an end !!",

So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over.

Has no idea whatsoever about the industry, nor can he work out the plain facts that ANGS are about to be reborn and things are looking very good.  Yes they have debt but they are about to transform revenue.  I can categorically assure you that the lender will support them and they will support on better terms than the previous deal.  It is in everyone\u2019s interest to resolve this and we now have the magic factor of significant production increase and much higher gas prices.  Not forgetting they have amassed a reasonable cash pile whilst amicably agreeing a pause in payments whilst they renegotiate.   I am expecting very soon to hear confirmation of an additional well to be drilled.",

They rant with such passion, but as you listen to what they say it becomes increasingly clear that there is simply no reason nor logic behind the words and they are, in fact, quite insane. Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics. The sword of Damocles hangs over your head due to your own outrageous claims and the hair holding it is going to break sooner or later. When it does I will be here laughing. Tik tok\u2026",

We KNOW they had spunked pretty much all of their revenues at the end of the generous grace period, which can ONLY be put down to almost all consumed on basic OPEX, \u00a33711 MILLION / 24 months = an OPEX cash burn of \u00a31.54 MILLION/Month. STAGGERING !!! When you look at the Quarterlies do you not find it ODD that when the generous grace period ended, it oddly aligned with the monthly revenues dropping from above \u00a35m per quarter to the lowly 3's  hmmmmmmmmmm looks very orchestrated to me, or you could align it to the Booster that is supposed to BOOST revenues & production, but in reality it crashed it and is struggling to recover,, YOU DECIDEEEE !!!

When Angus returns with terms, production stability and forward visibility, the same voices shouting \u201cdefault\u201d today will quietly disappear or pretend they always expected a rerate.

No capital or interest repayments required in Year One. 20 quarterly capital repayments of \u00a31.25m required starting end Mar 2025. Interest rate of 12% per annum (SONIA + 8%). We know that no capital repayments were made at either Mar 25 or Jun 25, because ANGS didn't have the cash at the time. So after  Year One (the grace year) ANGS would have owed \u00a320m of capital and \u00a32.23m of interest, totalling \u00a322.23m pounds. Presuming they've so far paid nothing back, \u00a322.23m over now four years will attract 16 quarterly repayments of \u00a31.39m plus a total of \u00a35.87m of interest, totalling \u00a328m.",

The Company is now evaluating options for the extended well test. Lidsey (80% Working Interest) Due to the high cost of water disposal, Lidsey has remained shut in, however, as previously stated, a planning application has been submitted to allow for transportation of produced water off-site to the Brockham oil field for voidage replacement and pressure maintenance. This application has now been approved, and we are awaiting imminent formal validation. Once received, the Company will progress to test the integrity of the well in readiness for future production, confirm the operability of the currently installed artificial lift, and establish the re-instatement production potential of the X2 well. This is low-cost operation, and if successful, it will allow for the reinstatement of the site with produced water trucked to Brockham for injection.",

Near term US weather forecasts turned milder, reducing heating demand and allowing more gas to flow to LNG export plants, improving the outlook for deliveries to Europe and the UK. The UK remains highly sensitive due to limited storage capacity and heavy reliance on imports, making it vulnerable to regional and global supply pressures. Geopolitical risk premiums also faded after US President Donald Trump said Washington is in talks with Iran, easing fears of disruptions to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz. Still, underlying vulnerability remains, with EU gas storage at just 41.1% full and UK storage around 36.9%. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uk-natural-gas",

We will not get a good idea of the effects (good, bad or so-so) until end March. \"During the workover programme production will be periodically suspended, with expected uptime at circa 90% in December 2025 and circa 60% in January 2026. The workover programme is designed over two phases, with the physical intervention followed by a clean-up period of approximately four to six weeks, before the results of the workovers can be assessed in March 2026.\" Which seems reasonable to me - and of course things slip so they move a bit to the right.

Obviously this shower were in SUCH a good position that they had to cry a suspension to save their souls, and many, many months later there is STILL no fix to this problem, surely if it was all so rosy and revenues could easily manage the debt then firstly it would never have happened like this, and secondly a correction deal could have been sorted pretty sharpish... unfortunately it is teetering and will likely continue just as PPP is doing, while retail sit here and can do nowt !!!",

Ultimately Trafigura are the offtake too, so it isn't like they can't see the sales revenue, and I am sure if they really wanted to, they could probably force some form of legal first dibs and simply give a small % of what remains to keep this shower running the field \"for THEM\"",

Saltfleetby is a producing UK gas field generating real revenue today, not a hypothetical asset or a story stock \u2026.. The most recent updates confirmed materially higher gas sales in Q4 2025, with revenue north of \u00a34m for the quarter. This came from improved uptime and optimisation, not a one-off spike. Production has stabilised and that directly improves cash generation, which is the only thing that ultimately matters \u2026.. Legacy low-price hedges have now largely rolled off, meaning a much greater proportion of production is being sold at prevailing market prices. Valuing the field as if those old hedges are permanent is simply outdated. Margins today are meaningfully better than they were even six months ago \u2026.. Claims that the company has \u201cno cash\u201d or \u201cno options\u201d also ignore the fact that Angus has been operating for an extended period with limited capex while creditor discussions continue. Lenders are rational actors and benefit far more from supporting a producing asset than forcing failure. That reality is why restructuring talks are ongoing \u2026.. Finally, writing off Saltfleetby as having no future value beyond immediate production shows a lack of perspective. Depleted gas fields with infrastructure and grid access have strategic importance in the UK. Whether people like management or not is irrelevant \u2014 the asset has value, and the current market price reflects sentiment, not fundamentals \u2026..",

A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either!

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either! In Summary, If you give AI all the information it needs to give you a more rounded less rose tinted wearing outlook it will give you a very different answer.",

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

This isn't exported in lorries but in a long pipeline to a refinery which is miles from the site.  It's been there for 20 years.   The pipeline is BURIED underground and is not visible. Do keep up!

RNSs are not meant to read like investor presentations or broker models\u2026. they are regulatory disclosures, and by design they don\u2019t include forward guidance, speculative cash forecasts, or granular commercial negotiations\u2026. That doesn\u2019t make the facts that are disclosed meaningless\u2026. \u00a330m total debt is a fact\u2026. the workover being funded from cash is a fact\u2026. materially higher production post-workover is a fact\u2026. lower opex versus last year is a fact\u2026. and legacy hedges rolling off into a stronger pricing environment is also a fact\u2026. You keep saying \u201cno facts\u201d while ignoring the ones that don\u2019t fit your narrative\u2026. then you fall back on history as if companies are not allowed to change trajectory after restructuring\u2026. that\u2019s analysis anchored in the past, not what\u2019s happening now\u2026. No one here is claiming RNSs tell the entire story\u2026. but they don\u2019t need to\u2026. what matters is direction of travel, and that direction has clearly improved compared with where Angus was heading into default last year\u2026. Cash generation improving, costs down, production up, and debt being restructured at lower rates is not a \u201cwet dream\u201d\u2026. it\u2019s a stabilisation phase\u2026. and stabilisation is exactly what precedes rerating in situations like this\u2026. You\u2019re free to remain sceptical\u2026. but dismissing every positive development as fiction doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026. it just means you\u2019re choosing not to engage with the facts that are already on the table\u2026.",

Calling the recent production uplift a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d ignores the fact that Saltfleetby has always been capable of higher rates once constraints were addressed\u2026. the latest RNS confirms a material improvement following the workover, not some cosmetic bounce\u2026. On the share count point, yes there are a lot of shares in issue\u2026. that\u2019s already well known and fully reflected in the price\u2026. what changes outcomes isn\u2019t the historical capital structure, it\u2019s cash generation and balance sheet repair, and that\u2019s exactly where things are improving\u2026. As for the \u201cnew well\u201d scepticism, nobody is pretending it\u2019s risk-free or imminent tomorrow\u2026. the point is that higher current production and stronger margins give Angus options they simply didn\u2019t have before\u2026. optionality matters when a company is coming out of a stressed period\u2026. You also keep anchoring to falling gas prices as if that\u2019s a certainty\u2026. prices fluctuate, but Angus is producing now, into a materially better pricing environment than most of 2024, with legacy hedges rolling off and a much leaner cost base\u2026. that combination is what improves margins, not a single headline price\u2026. No one sensible is saying this is a guaranteed straight line to \u00a37\u201310m per quarter overnight\u2026. what\u2019s being said is that the trajectory has changed\u2026. higher production, better realised prices, lower costs and active restructuring are all moving in the right direction\u2026. That\u2019s progress\u2026. and it\u2019s exactly what you want to see from a company that\u2019s been in suspension and is working its way back\u2026.",

I wouldn't trust them to drill a hole in a wall to hang a picture, never mind a completely \"new\" well, AND there is by no means a guarantee anything they drill will find anything of commercial value, AND if they hit the existing reservoir, then it too will simply face depleted low pressures and induced liquids.

First, the latest RNS didn\u2019t just point to a modest 15\u201320% uplift \u2014 it reported a material increase in production, well ahead of that range. That tells you optimisation is already delivering more than the low expectations you\u2019re anchoring to\u2026.. Second, no one has claimed the current intervention is a \u201cpermanent fix\u201d in isolation. It\u2019s one step in a wider optimisation programme. Coil tubing, acidisation, flowback management and drawdown control are standard tools to reset well performance and maximise near-term cash generation \u2014 which is exactly what Angus needs right now\u2026.. The key point you keep overlooking is that Angus no longer requires a perfect reservoir outcome. Higher production today at current gas prices materially improves cash flow, strengthens the balance sheet, and changes the dynamics with creditors. That alone reduces risk versus the situation twelve months ago\u2026.. As for gas prices, yes they fluctuate \u2014 but the company is producing now into a stronger pricing environment, not modelling distant hypotheticals. Cash in the bank today matters more than speculative decline curves six months out\u2026.. Could production moderate over time? Of course. But starting from a significantly higher base, with ongoing optimisation and lower costs, puts Angus in a far better position than the \u201cinevitable failure\u201d scenario you keep repeating\u2026.. The latest RNS shows progress, not deterioration. Ignoring that and defaulting to worst-case outcomes doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually being reported\u2026..",

At this early stage of optimisation, seeing output at these levels is encouraging. No one is claiming this is the final stabilised rate, but starting from a much higher base fundamentally improves the economics. Even a moderation from recent highs still leaves production well ahead of where Angus was operating previously\u2026.. Crucially, the company no longer needs heroic assumptions. Higher production at current gas prices translates into strong near-term cash generation, covering opex and materially strengthening the balance sheet. That shifts discussions with creditors and lenders onto far firmer ground than last year\u2026.. Yes, reservoir management and decline are always factors, but optimisation is ongoing and the field is delivering today. The narrative that this is all temporary or destined to fail doesn\u2019t align with the actual data being released\u2026.. Momentum matters. Rising production, improving cash flow, lower costs, and restructuring discussions backed by operational progress are exactly what the market needs to see. If this trajectory continues, the outlook looks meaningfully better than the constant worst-case scenarios being repeated here\u2026..",

This will continue and can only get worse as you produce more and the reservoir pressure continues to drop. If they have only done a simple acid wash (which appears to be the case) all they've done is to clean up some of the pathways inbetweeen the rock grains near the well bore.  That should lead to a short-term uptick in gas production as gas  will be able to flow more easily to the well.  However it doesn't change the physics.    Fluids will continue to drop out, and if they pull too hard that will eventually totally impede any gas flow.  The well will choke itself to death.  Even a new well will suffer the same problems - unless they can identify a part of the field that has so far been untapped and has near original pressures.  There is zero evidence that this is the case or  that  ANGS have the knowledge or ability to identify such an area should it exist.",

          "content": "\"\"Does this intervention not provide a permanent solution to flushing out the liquids?\"\" The problem with the information this shower of sheite provides, is that it is very limited on detail. BUT from what they HAVE supplied, it pretty much indicates that they are NOT installing velocity strings as part of the workover, it is JUST a simple coil tubing intervention, to pump acid and then to flow out wellbore and near wellbore BANKED liquids and backflow the acid cleanup fluids. Once this has been flushed out, it appears the wells will simply go back on to production as before. WHICH is sheite, because it WILL result in simply inducing MORE liquids and the choking off of free gas continues... So expect an uplift in overall production, of around 15-20% overall, with a short honeymoon period, before a slow continued decline due to those liquids accumulating. Ultimately, it will not bring in the production needed to bail this shower out of the defaulted debt sinkhole they are in, unless gas prices rally and stay at 150p +, which is ALSO unlikely as demand season is quickly coming to an end !!",

It owes PF around \u00a32 million for the original SFBY purchase. It owes Mercuria and Aleph around \u00a33 million on the eternal 8% ORRI that it's also never paid to date. I honestly forget if there are any other large sums owed - I may well have forgotten remaining amounts to settle previous hedge contracts - but let's go with the \u00a334 million above as a starting point. So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over. Without knowing that stuff, any speculation is pointless.",

It is in everyone\u2019s interest to resolve this and we now have the magic factor of significant production increase and much higher gas prices.

They rant with such passion, but as you listen to what they say it becomes increasingly clear that there is simply no reason nor logic behind the words and they are, in fact, quite insane. Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics. The sword of Damocles hangs over your head due to your own outrageous claims and the hair holding it is going to break sooner or later. When it does I will be here laughing. Tik tok\u2026",

We KNOW they had spunked pretty much all of their revenues at the end of the generous grace period, which can ONLY be put down to almost all consumed on basic OPEX, \u00a33711 MILLION / 24 months = an OPEX cash burn of \u00a31.54 MILLION/Month. STAGGERING !!! When you look at the Quarterlies do you not find it ODD that when the generous grace period ended, it oddly aligned with the monthly revenues dropping from above \u00a35m per quarter to the lowly 3's  hmmmmmmmmmm looks very orchestrated to me, or you could align it to the Booster that is supposed to BOOST revenues & production, but in reality it crashed it and is struggling to recover,, YOU DECIDEEEE !!! However, regardless of the DEFAULT, that is a HUGE amount of money squandered on what exactly ??? \u00a337.11 MILLION",

It\u2019s come up with the following after some pertinent questions from myself with years of experience here. Saltfleetby \u2013 Post\u2011Workover Reality Check SF4 hasn\u2019t been worked over and is still the most liquids\u2011prone well. Realistic output is only 0.02\u20130.04 mscm/d. SF2 has been cleaned up and is now giving a steady 0.05\u20130.06 mscm/d. SF7 is the big swing factor. The brief 0.18 mscm/d spike shows all three wells can hit that level, but SF7 clearly isn\u2019t stable yet and has been mostly offline for the last two weeks. The current flat 0.09\u20130.10 mscm/d is simply SF2 + SF4 while SF7 is still being managed. Liquids storage is now a hard surface bottleneck. Even if the wells could push higher, the site can\u2019t run flat\u2011out without overloading tanks and causing slugging. Realistic sustained rate after full clean\u2011up: \u2248 0.13\u20130.15 mscm/d (with occasional short peaks up to 0.17\u20130.18 mscm/d when storage allows) Bottom line: The field will likely settle around 0.13\u20130.15 mscm/d once SF7 is properly back, because the limiting factor is now liquids handling, not the reservoir.",

No capital or interest repayments required in Year One. 20 quarterly capital repayments of \u00a31.25m required starting end Mar 2025. Interest rate of 12% per annum (SONIA + 8%). We know that no capital repayments were made at either Mar 25 or Jun 25, because ANGS didn't have the cash at the time. So after  Year One (the grace year) ANGS would have owed \u00a320m of capital and \u00a32.23m of interest, totalling \u00a322.23m pounds. Presuming they've so far paid nothing back, \u00a322.23m over now four years will attract 16 quarterly repayments of \u00a31.39m plus a total of \u00a35.87m of interest, totalling \u00a328m.",

The Company is now evaluating options for the extended well test. Lidsey (80% Working Interest) Due to the high cost of water disposal, Lidsey has remained shut in, however, as previously stated, a planning application has been submitted to allow for transportation of produced water off-site to the Brockham oil field for voidage replacement and pressure maintenance. This application has now been approved, and we are awaiting imminent formal validation. Once received, the Company will progress to test the integrity of the well in readiness for future production, confirm the operability of the currently installed artificial lift, and establish the re-instatement production potential of the X2 well. This is low-cost operation, and if successful, it will allow for the reinstatement of the site with produced water trucked to Brockham for injection.",

Near term US weather forecasts turned milder, reducing heating demand and allowing more gas to flow to LNG export plants, improving the outlook for deliveries to Europe and the UK. The UK remains highly sensitive due to limited storage capacity and heavy reliance on imports, making it vulnerable to regional and global supply pressures. Geopolitical risk premiums also faded after US President Donald Trump said Washington is in talks with Iran, easing fears of disruptions to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz. Still, underlying vulnerability remains, with EU gas storage at just 41.1% full and UK storage around 36.9%. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uk-natural-gas",

If the figures are low this week it's a fact - and there is nothing you or I or God in his heaven can do about it.   :(((((((((( I didn't make any comments about \"lower production\" because we all know they forecast them when they announced the work over. and intervention.  We will not get a good idea of the effects (good, bad or so-so) until end March. \"During the workover programme production will be periodically suspended, with expected uptime at circa 90% in December 2025 and circa 60% in January 2026. The workover programme is designed over two phases, with the physical intervention followed by a clean-up period of approximately four to six weeks, before the results of the workovers can be assessed in March 2026.\" Which seems reasonable to me - and of course things slip so they move a bit to the right.

Obviously this shower were in SUCH a good position that they had to cry a suspension to save their souls, and many, many months later there is STILL no fix to this problem, surely if it was all so rosy and revenues could easily manage the debt then firstly it would never have happened like this, and secondly a correction deal could have been sorted pretty sharpish... unfortunately it is teetering and will likely continue just as PPP is doing, while retail sit here and can do nowt !!!",

Ultimately Trafigura are the offtake too, so it isn't like they can't see the sales revenue, and I am sure if they really wanted to, they could probably force some form of legal first dibs and simply give a small % of what remains to keep this shower running the field \"for THEM\"",

          "content": "A lot of the negativity in this thread relies on ignoring what Angus has actually reported via RNS and instead repeating worst-case assumptions as if they are facts. Saltfleetby is a producing UK gas field generating real revenue today, not a hypothetical asset or a story stock \u2026.. The most recent updates confirmed materially higher gas sales in Q4 2025, with revenue north of \u00a34m for the quarter. This came from improved uptime and optimisation, not a one-off spike. Production has stabilised and that directly improves cash generation, which is the only thing that ultimately matters \u2026.. Legacy low-price hedges have now largely rolled off, meaning a much greater proportion of production is being sold at prevailing market prices. Valuing the field as if those old hedges are permanent is simply outdated. Margins today are meaningfully better than they were even six months ago \u2026.. Claims that the company has \u201cno cash\u201d or \u201cno options\u201d also ignore the fact that Angus has been operating for an extended period with limited capex while creditor discussions continue. Lenders are rational actors and benefit far more from supporting a producing asset than forcing failure. That reality is why restructuring talks are ongoing \u2026.. Finally, writing off Saltfleetby as having no future value beyond immediate production shows a lack of perspective. Depleted gas fields with infrastructure and grid access have strategic importance in the UK. Whether people like management or not is irrelevant \u2014 the asset has value, and the current market price reflects sentiment, not fundamentals \u2026..",

A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either!

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either! In Summary, If you give AI all the information it needs to give you a more rounded less rose tinted wearing outlook it will give you a very different answer.",

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

This isn't exported in lorries but in a long pipeline to a refinery which is miles from the site.  It's been there for 20 years.   The pipeline is BURIED underground and is not visible. Do keep up!  And check with Mrs Ocelot before posting absolute drivel or it's back to the nursery class for you",

That doesn\u2019t make the facts that are disclosed meaningless\u2026. \u00a330m total debt is a fact\u2026. the workover being funded from cash is a fact\u2026. materially higher production post-workover is a fact\u2026. lower opex versus last year is a fact\u2026. and legacy hedges rolling off into a stronger pricing environment is also a fact\u2026. You keep saying \u201cno facts\u201d while ignoring the ones that don\u2019t fit your narrative\u2026. then you fall back on history as if companies are not allowed to change trajectory after restructuring\u2026. that\u2019s analysis anchored in the past, not what\u2019s happening now\u2026. No one here is claiming RNSs tell the entire story\u2026. but they don\u2019t need to\u2026. what matters is direction of travel, and that direction has clearly improved compared with where Angus was heading into default last year\u2026. Cash generation improving, costs down, production up, and debt being restructured at lower rates is not a \u201cwet dream\u201d\u2026. it\u2019s a stabilisation phase\u2026. and stabilisation is exactly what precedes rerating in situations like this\u2026. You\u2019re free to remain sceptical\u2026. but dismissing every positive development as fiction doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026. it just means you\u2019re choosing not to engage with the facts that are already on the table\u2026.",

Calling the recent production uplift a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d ignores the fact that Saltfleetby has always been capable of higher rates once constraints were addressed\u2026. the latest RNS confirms a material improvement following the workover, not some cosmetic bounce\u2026. On the share count point, yes there are a lot of shares in issue\u2026. that\u2019s already well known and fully reflected in the price\u2026. what changes outcomes isn\u2019t the historical capital structure, it\u2019s cash generation and balance sheet repair, and that\u2019s exactly where things are improving\u2026. As for the \u201cnew well\u201d scepticism, nobody is pretending it\u2019s risk-free or imminent tomorrow\u2026. the point is that higher current production and stronger margins give Angus options they simply didn\u2019t have before\u2026. optionality matters when a company is coming out of a stressed period\u2026. You also keep anchoring to falling gas prices as if that\u2019s a certainty\u2026. prices fluctuate, but Angus is producing now, into a materially better pricing environment than most of 2024, with legacy hedges rolling off and a much leaner cost base\u2026. that combination is what improves margins, not a single headline price\u2026. No one sensible is saying this is a guaranteed straight line to \u00a37\u201310m per quarter overnight\u2026. what\u2019s being said is that the trajectory has changed\u2026. higher production, better realised prices, lower costs and active restructuring are all moving in the right direction\u2026. That\u2019s progress\u2026. and it\u2019s exactly what you want to see from a company that\u2019s been in suspension and is working its way back\u2026.",

I wouldn't trust them to drill a hole in a wall to hang a picture, never mind a completely \"new\" well, AND there is by no means a guarantee anything they drill will find anything of commercial value, AND if they hit the existing reservoir, then it too will simply face depleted low pressures and induced liquids.

First, the latest RNS didn\u2019t just point to a modest 15\u201320% uplift \u2014 it reported a material increase in production, well ahead of that range. That tells you optimisation is already delivering more than the low expectations you\u2019re anchoring to\u2026.. Second, no one has claimed the current intervention is a \u201cpermanent fix\u201d in isolation. It\u2019s one step in a wider optimisation programme. Coil tubing, acidisation, flowback management and drawdown control are standard tools to reset well performance and maximise near-term cash generation \u2014 which is exactly what Angus needs right now\u2026.. The key point you keep overlooking is that Angus no longer requires a perfect reservoir outcome. Higher production today at current gas prices materially improves cash flow, strengthens the balance sheet, and changes the dynamics with creditors. That alone reduces risk versus the situation twelve months ago\u2026.. As for gas prices, yes they fluctuate \u2014 but the company is producing now into a stronger pricing environment, not modelling distant hypotheticals. Cash in the bank today matters more than speculative decline curves six months out\u2026.. Could production moderate over time? Of course. But starting from a significantly higher base, with ongoing optimisation and lower costs, puts Angus in a far better position than the \u201cinevitable failure\u201d scenario you keep repeating\u2026.. The latest RNS shows progress, not deterioration. Ignoring that and defaulting to worst-case outcomes doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually being reported\u2026..",

At this early stage of optimisation, seeing output at these levels is encouraging. No one is claiming this is the final stabilised rate, but starting from a much higher base fundamentally improves the economics. Even a moderation from recent highs still leaves production well ahead of where Angus was operating previously\u2026.. Crucially, the company no longer needs heroic assumptions. Higher production at current gas prices translates into strong near-term cash generation, covering opex and materially strengthening the balance sheet. That shifts discussions with creditors and lenders onto far firmer ground than last year\u2026.. Yes, reservoir management and decline are always factors, but optimisation is ongoing and the field is delivering today. The narrative that this is all temporary or destined to fail doesn\u2019t align with the actual data being released\u2026.. Momentum matters. Rising production, improving cash flow, lower costs, and restructuring discussions backed by operational progress are exactly what the market needs to see. If this trajectory continues, the outlook looks meaningfully better than the constant worst-case scenarios being repeated here\u2026..",

This will continue and can only get worse as you produce more and the reservoir pressure continues to drop. If they have only done a simple acid wash (which appears to be the case) all they've done is to clean up some of the pathways inbetweeen the rock grains near the well bore.  That should lead to a short-term uptick in gas production as gas  will be able to flow more easily to the well.  However it doesn't change the physics.    Fluids will continue to drop out, and if they pull too hard that will eventually totally impede any gas flow.  The well will choke itself to death.  Even a new well will suffer the same problems - unless they can identify a part of the field that has so far been untapped and has near original pressures.  There is zero evidence that this is the case or  that  ANGS have the knowledge or ability to identify such an area should it exist.",

          "content": "\"\"Does this intervention not provide a permanent solution to flushing out the liquids?\"\" The problem with the information this shower of sheite provides, is that it is very limited on detail. BUT from what they HAVE supplied, it pretty much indicates that they are NOT installing velocity strings as part of the workover, it is JUST a simple coil tubing intervention, to pump acid and then to flow out wellbore and near wellbore BANKED liquids and backflow the acid cleanup fluids. Once this has been flushed out, it appears the wells will simply go back on to production as before. WHICH is sheite, because it WILL result in simply inducing MORE liquids and the choking off of free gas continues... So expect an uplift in overall production, of around 15-20% overall, with a short honeymoon period, before a slow continued decline due to those liquids accumulating. Ultimately, it will not bring in the production needed to bail this shower out of the defaulted debt sinkhole they are in, unless gas prices rally and stay at 150p +, which is ALSO unlikely as demand season is quickly coming to an end !!",

If he's ignored his world would crumble. Belittling people on this board so in his head he feels superior. He'll say filter me but its a comical read how he throws a line with a baited hook then peaters people to answer him so he gets his daily relevance boost.

It owes PF around \u00a32 million for the original SFBY purchase. It owes Mercuria and Aleph around \u00a33 million on the eternal 8% ORRI that it's also never paid to date. I honestly forget if there are any other large sums owed - I may well have forgotten remaining amounts to settle previous hedge contracts - but let's go with the \u00a334 million above as a starting point. So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over. Without knowing that stuff, any speculation is pointless.",

It is in everyone\u2019s interest to resolve this and we now have the magic factor of significant production increase and much higher gas prices.

They rant with such passion, but as you listen to what they say it becomes increasingly clear that there is simply no reason nor logic behind the words and they are, in fact, quite insane. Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics. The sword of Damocles hangs over your head due to your own outrageous claims and the hair holding it is going to break sooner or later. When it does I will be here laughing. Tik tok\u2026",

We KNOW they had spunked pretty much all of their revenues at the end of the generous grace period, which can ONLY be put down to almost all consumed on basic OPEX, \u00a33711 MILLION / 24 months = an OPEX cash burn of \u00a31.54 MILLION/Month. STAGGERING !!! When you look at the Quarterlies do you not find it ODD that when the generous grace period ended, it oddly aligned with the monthly revenues dropping from above \u00a35m per quarter to the lowly 3's  hmmmmmmmmmm looks very orchestrated to me, or you could align it to the Booster that is supposed to BOOST revenues & production, but in reality it crashed it and is struggling to recover,, YOU DECIDEEEE !!! However, regardless of the DEFAULT, that is a HUGE amount of money squandered on what exactly ??? \u00a337.11 MILLION",

No capital or interest repayments required in Year One. 20 quarterly capital repayments of \u00a31.25m required starting end Mar 2025. Interest rate of 12% per annum (SONIA + 8%). We know that no capital repayments were made at either Mar 25 or Jun 25, because ANGS didn't have the cash at the time. So after  Year One (the grace year) ANGS would have owed \u00a320m of capital and \u00a32.23m of interest, totalling \u00a322.23m pounds. Presuming they've so far paid nothing back, \u00a322.23m over now four years will attract 16 quarterly repayments of \u00a31.39m plus a total of \u00a35.87m of interest, totalling \u00a328m.",

This application has now been approved, and we are awaiting imminent formal validation. Once received, the Company will progress to test the integrity of the well in readiness for future production, confirm the operability of the currently installed artificial lift, and establish the re-instatement production potential of the X2 well. This is low-cost operation, and if successful, it will allow for the reinstatement of the site with produced water trucked to Brockham for injection.",

Near term US weather forecasts turned milder, reducing heating demand and allowing more gas to flow to LNG export plants, improving the outlook for deliveries to Europe and the UK. The UK remains highly sensitive due to limited storage capacity and heavy reliance on imports, making it vulnerable to regional and global supply pressures. Geopolitical risk premiums also faded after US President Donald Trump said Washington is in talks with Iran, easing fears of disruptions to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz. Still, underlying vulnerability remains, with EU gas storage at just 41.1% full and UK storage around 36.9%. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uk-natural-gas",

We will not get a good idea of the effects (good, bad or so-so) until end March. \"During the workover programme production will be periodically suspended, with expected uptime at circa 90% in December 2025 and circa 60% in January 2026. The workover programme is designed over two phases, with the physical intervention followed by a clean-up period of approximately four to six weeks, before the results of the workovers can be assessed in March 2026.\" Which seems reasonable to me - and of course things slip so they move a bit to the right.

Obviously this shower were in SUCH a good position that they had to cry a suspension to save their souls, and many, many months later there is STILL no fix to this problem, surely if it was all so rosy and revenues could easily manage the debt then firstly it would never have happened like this, and secondly a correction deal could have been sorted pretty sharpish... unfortunately it is teetering and will likely continue just as PPP is doing, while retail sit here and can do nowt !!!",

Ultimately Trafigura are the offtake too, so it isn't like they can't see the sales revenue, and I am sure if they really wanted to, they could probably force some form of legal first dibs and simply give a small % of what remains to keep this shower running the field \"for THEM\"",

Saltfleetby is a producing UK gas field generating real revenue today, not a hypothetical asset or a story stock \u2026.. The most recent updates confirmed materially higher gas sales in Q4 2025, with revenue north of \u00a34m for the quarter. This came from improved uptime and optimisation, not a one-off spike. Production has stabilised and that directly improves cash generation, which is the only thing that ultimately matters \u2026.. Legacy low-price hedges have now largely rolled off, meaning a much greater proportion of production is being sold at prevailing market prices. Valuing the field as if those old hedges are permanent is simply outdated. Margins today are meaningfully better than they were even six months ago \u2026.. Claims that the company has \u201cno cash\u201d or \u201cno options\u201d also ignore the fact that Angus has been operating for an extended period with limited capex while creditor discussions continue. Lenders are rational actors and benefit far more from supporting a producing asset than forcing failure. That reality is why restructuring talks are ongoing \u2026.. Finally, writing off Saltfleetby as having no future value beyond immediate production shows a lack of perspective. Depleted gas fields with infrastructure and grid access have strategic importance in the UK. Whether people like management or not is irrelevant \u2014 the asset has value, and the current market price reflects sentiment, not fundamentals \u2026..",

No one has managed to put up a decent argument and numbers to be even slightly convincing, and the reason for that is they got too greedy and thought they could do whatever they wanted and get away with it, they have with retail because we have no voice, BUT Trafi are no fools, and they now totally control the situation and the outcome, AND THEY owe retail NOTHING, Trafi WILL clean up with this shower simply draining what is left of this depleted field as little more than sideshow operators, to fill Trafi coffers",

A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either!

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

(Low estimate) and that was also having to Spend a minimum of \u00a311million that they haven\u2019t got, and would have to borrow, and get permission to drill( see recent court rulings relating to this) (Angus also withdrew the planning permission and have not re-applied) . 2. A blip caused by a winter storm in the US cannot be used as a base for its figures. Ask it to do its sums on Summer 28 forward pricing only 55p per therm or even this summer 73.380 today (ice.com) 3.Angus hold a licence up until April 2027 for Hydrocarbon extraction! Nothing else. They as far as I can see haven\u2019t applied to store Gas, hydrogen, or Co2, they don\u2019t own the land or the big hole in the ground either! In Summary, If you give AI all the information it needs to give you a more rounded less rose tinted wearing outlook it will give you a very different answer.",

          "content": "As of January 2026, the Saltfleetby Gas Field (wholly owned by Angus Energy) has an estimated going-concern valuation of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million. This valuation is based on the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) and 2025/2026 financial updates. The field is the UK\u2019s largest onshore gas producer and its value is derived from three main areas: 1. Asset Valuation (NPV10) According to the technical audits, the \"Net Present Value\" (discounted at 10%) of the field\u2019s future cash flows is: P90 (Low Estimate): \u00a357.1 million P50 (Best Estimate): \u00a364.5 million Note: These figures are post-tax and already account for the UK government's Energy Profits Levy (Windfall Tax). 2. Revenue and Production (Going Concern) The field is currently a high-performing \"cash cow\" for Angus Energy. In the most recent trading update (issued January 22, 2026), the field showed: Quarterly Revenue: \u00a34.12 million (for Q4 2025). Annualized Revenue: Approximately \u00a316 million \u2013 \u00a320 million depending on seasonal gas prices. Output: Producing roughly 1.66 million therms of gas per month. 3. Future \"Upside\" Value Beyond current gas extraction, the field holds significant value for its potential after the gas is gone: Gas Storage: It is considered one of the best candidates in the UK for conversion into a hydrogen storage facility or for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This adds \"strategic value\" that isn't fully captured in the current \u00a365m gas valuation. New Drilling: Two new wells (SF9 and SF10) were scheduled for 2025 and early 2026 to maintain production \"plateau\" and accelerate gas extraction. Summary of \"Going Concern\" Health While the asset itself is valuable, the \"going concern\" status of the parent company (Angus Energy) was under review in late 2025 due to debt restructuring. However, the January 2026 update indicates a strong recovery, with production surging and legacy low-price \"hedges\" finally ending, allowing the company to sell gas at full market prices (approx. 102p per therm).",

This isn't exported in lorries but in a long pipeline to a refinery which is miles from the site.  It's been there for 20 years.   The pipeline is BURIED underground and is not visible. Do keep up!

RNSs are not meant to read like investor presentations or broker models\u2026. they are regulatory disclosures, and by design they don\u2019t include forward guidance, speculative cash forecasts, or granular commercial negotiations\u2026. That doesn\u2019t make the facts that are disclosed meaningless\u2026. \u00a330m total debt is a fact\u2026. the workover being funded from cash is a fact\u2026. materially higher production post-workover is a fact\u2026. lower opex versus last year is a fact\u2026. and legacy hedges rolling off into a stronger pricing environment is also a fact\u2026. You keep saying \u201cno facts\u201d while ignoring the ones that don\u2019t fit your narrative\u2026. then you fall back on history as if companies are not allowed to change trajectory after restructuring\u2026. that\u2019s analysis anchored in the past, not what\u2019s happening now\u2026. No one here is claiming RNSs tell the entire story\u2026. but they don\u2019t need to\u2026. what matters is direction of travel, and that direction has clearly improved compared with where Angus was heading into default last year\u2026. Cash generation improving, costs down, production up, and debt being restructured at lower rates is not a \u201cwet dream\u201d\u2026. it\u2019s a stabilisation phase\u2026. and stabilisation is exactly what precedes rerating in situations like this\u2026. You\u2019re free to remain sceptical\u2026. but dismissing every positive development as fiction doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026. it just means you\u2019re choosing not to engage with the facts that are already on the table\u2026.",

Calling the recent production uplift a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d ignores the fact that Saltfleetby has always been capable of higher rates once constraints were addressed\u2026. the latest RNS confirms a material improvement following the workover, not some cosmetic bounce\u2026. On the share count point, yes there are a lot of shares in issue\u2026. that\u2019s already well known and fully reflected in the price\u2026. what changes outcomes isn\u2019t the historical capital structure, it\u2019s cash generation and balance sheet repair, and that\u2019s exactly where things are improving\u2026. As for the \u201cnew well\u201d scepticism, nobody is pretending it\u2019s risk-free or imminent tomorrow\u2026. the point is that higher current production and stronger margins give Angus options they simply didn\u2019t have before\u2026. optionality matters when a company is coming out of a stressed period\u2026. You also keep anchoring to falling gas prices as if that\u2019s a certainty\u2026. prices fluctuate, but Angus is producing now, into a materially better pricing environment than most of 2024, with legacy hedges rolling off and a much leaner cost base\u2026. that combination is what improves margins, not a single headline price\u2026. No one sensible is saying this is a guaranteed straight line to \u00a37\u201310m per quarter overnight\u2026. what\u2019s being said is that the trajectory has changed\u2026. higher production, better realised prices, lower costs and active restructuring are all moving in the right direction\u2026. That\u2019s progress\u2026. and it\u2019s exactly what you want to see from a company that\u2019s been in suspension and is working its way back\u2026.",

I wouldn't trust them to drill a hole in a wall to hang a picture, never mind a completely \"new\" well, AND there is by no means a guarantee anything they drill will find anything of commercial value, AND if they hit the existing reservoir, then it too will simply face depleted low pressures and induced liquids.

Market Tailwinds: The expiration of low-priced legacy hedges in mid-2025 and recent peaks in UK gas prices (100.10 p/therm in Jan 2026) have significantly improved Angus Energy's operating margins.

Higher production at current gas prices isn\u2019t hypothetical \u2014 it\u2019s a current operational fact being reported to the market\u2026. That means stronger cash generation and a far better starting point than the flat-lined or declining production people here keep assuming\u2026. Even if gas prices moderate from current highs, improved production and lower costs still provide significantly more operational cash than before\u2026. That\u2019s exactly the sort of fundamental improvement that de-risks suspension outcomes\u2026. Using worst-case reservoir decline and short \u201choneymoon\u201d narratives as if they\u2019re the only possible trajectory ignores the actual RNS figures\u2026.

First, the latest RNS didn\u2019t just point to a modest 15\u201320% uplift \u2014 it reported a material increase in production, well ahead of that range. That tells you optimisation is already delivering more than the low expectations you\u2019re anchoring to\u2026.. Second, no one has claimed the current intervention is a \u201cpermanent fix\u201d in isolation. It\u2019s one step in a wider optimisation programme. Coil tubing, acidisation, flowback management and drawdown control are standard tools to reset well performance and maximise near-term cash generation \u2014 which is exactly what Angus needs right now\u2026.. The key point you keep overlooking is that Angus no longer requires a perfect reservoir outcome. Higher production today at current gas prices materially improves cash flow, strengthens the balance sheet, and changes the dynamics with creditors. That alone reduces risk versus the situation twelve months ago\u2026.. As for gas prices, yes they fluctuate \u2014 but the company is producing now into a stronger pricing environment, not modelling distant hypotheticals. Cash in the bank today matters more than speculative decline curves six months out\u2026.. Could production moderate over time? Of course. But starting from a significantly higher base, with ongoing optimisation and lower costs, puts Angus in a far better position than the \u201cinevitable failure\u201d scenario you keep repeating\u2026.. The latest RNS shows progress, not deterioration. Ignoring that and defaulting to worst-case outcomes doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually being reported\u2026..",

At this early stage of optimisation, seeing output at these levels is encouraging. No one is claiming this is the final stabilised rate, but starting from a much higher base fundamentally improves the economics. Even a moderation from recent highs still leaves production well ahead of where Angus was operating previously\u2026.. Crucially, the company no longer needs heroic assumptions. Higher production at current gas prices translates into strong near-term cash generation, covering opex and materially strengthening the balance sheet. That shifts discussions with creditors and lenders onto far firmer ground than last year\u2026.. Yes, reservoir management and decline are always factors, but optimisation is ongoing and the field is delivering today. The narrative that this is all temporary or destined to fail doesn\u2019t align with the actual data being released\u2026.. Momentum matters. Rising production, improving cash flow, lower costs, and restructuring discussions backed by operational progress are exactly what the market needs to see. If this trajectory continues, the outlook looks meaningfully better than the constant worst-case scenarios being repeated here\u2026..",

This will continue and can only get worse as you produce more and the reservoir pressure continues to drop. If they have only done a simple acid wash (which appears to be the case) all they've done is to clean up some of the pathways inbetweeen the rock grains near the well bore.  That should lead to a short-term uptick in gas production as gas  will be able to flow more easily to the well.  However it doesn't change the physics.    Fluids will continue to drop out, and if they pull too hard that will eventually totally impede any gas flow.  The well will choke itself to death.  Even a new well will suffer the same problems - unless they can identify a part of the field that has so far been untapped and has near original pressures.  There is zero evidence that this is the case or  that  ANGS have the knowledge or ability to identify such an area should it exist.",

BUT from what they HAVE supplied, it pretty much indicates that they are NOT installing velocity strings as part of the workover, it is JUST a simple coil tubing intervention, to pump acid and then to flow out wellbore and near wellbore BANKED liquids and backflow the acid cleanup fluids. Once this has been flushed out, it appears the wells will simply go back on to production as before. WHICH is sheite, because it WILL result in simply inducing MORE liquids and the choking off of free gas continues... So expect an uplift in overall production, of around 15-20% overall, with a short honeymoon period, before a slow continued decline due to those liquids accumulating. Ultimately, it will not bring in the production needed to bail this shower out of the defaulted debt sinkhole they are in, unless gas prices rally and stay at 150p +, which is ALSO unlikely as demand season is quickly coming to an end !!",

I honestly forget if there are any other large sums owed - I may well have forgotten remaining amounts to settle previous hedge contracts - but let's go with the \u00a334 million above as a starting point. So... for the last 8+ months, it's been \"renegotiating\" with Trafigura. We still don't know the terms that Trafigura will impose (and ANGS will have no choice but to accept... or go pop, as per the going concern language in all recent RNSes). Once those are known and there's clearer sight on ANGS's regular opex expenditure and also any future short- to mid-term capex needs, then we'll see what level of post capex/opex monthly revenue ANGS will be required to generate in order to meet the terms of any new refinancing, how possible that is, and what if anything will be left over.

Your laughable statement that Angus will need between \u00a332-37 million a year in revenue to break even fits firmly into the \u201cquite insane\u201d category and I am convinced that this will be proved within Q1 this year. If your lunatic claim is correct then Angus are clearly never going to be able to pay back the loans and we can all expect that Trafigura will call in their security and sell Saltfleetby to somebody else to recover their money. This means that we as investors will lose everything and you will be proved 100% correct in all your dire warnings about the company. However, if Trafigura do renegotiate the debt then it will be blindingly obvious to everyone that you have not got a clue what you are talking about and you just come on these boards to spout gibberish like it is your own private speakers corner. It can only be another couple of months until we find out the answer and you are proved publicly to be a total nut job with no grasp of business or economics.

We KNOW they had spunked pretty much all of their revenues at the end of the generous grace period, which can ONLY be put down to almost all consumed on basic OPEX, \u00a33711 MILLION / 24 months = an OPEX cash burn of \u00a31.54 MILLION/Month. STAGGERING !!! When you look at the Quarterlies do you not find it ODD that when the generous grace period ended, it oddly aligned with the monthly revenues dropping from above \u00a35m per quarter to the lowly 3's  hmmmmmmmmmm looks very orchestrated to me, or you could align it to the Booster that is supposed to BOOST revenues & production, but in reality it crashed it and is struggling to recover,, YOU DECIDEEEE !!! However, regardless of the DEFAULT, that is a HUGE amount of money squandered on what exactly ??? \u00a337.11 MILLION",
