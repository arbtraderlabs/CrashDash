      "Pattern 2 \u2013 The crash bottom score (11/21) is moderate, yet the drawdown of 99% from peak combined with zero trading volume creates a statistical anomaly that could mask a forthcoming corporate restructuring."

      "The Google Trends signal \u2018Dead_ticker \u2013 UP\u2019 contradicts the market\u2019s perception of the stock as worthless, hinting at possible hidden activity (e.g., a pending reverse split or a takeover bid) that has not yet entered formal channels."
