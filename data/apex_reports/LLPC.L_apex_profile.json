      "All volatility metrics (ATR and 20\u2011day StdDev) are zero, confirming the absence of trading volume and price discovery, while the lack of RNS announcements or catalysts indicates no forthcoming corporate events that could revive the ticker."

      "A zero\u2011price stock combined with a high momentum signal often signals a data\u2011feed glitch or a bot\u2011driven alert that misinterprets the ticker\u2019s status; this mismatch between Google Trends (dead ticker) and no social sentiment is a red flag for potential fraud or mis\u2011labeling.",
