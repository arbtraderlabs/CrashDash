IQE also experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, reflecting continued growth in AI and data centre markets, and increased sales of wireless products tied to new handset introductions which benefitted the Group's Taiwan operations.\nThis is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range\n[1]\n, with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves.\nAdditionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\nThe Group's banking facilities provided by HSBC Bank plc are subject to certain covenant tests. IQE has received a waiver from HSBC in relation to Q4 2025 EBITDA covenant testing, a reflection of the established and supportive relationship with the bank.\nCurrent Trading\nIQE enters 2026 with a strong Q1 order book, reflecting improved demand visibility across core segments including consumer mobile, data centre and AI-related photonics markets. The momentum in wireless demand observed in Q4 2025 is expected to continue, supported by existing customers and recent platform wins.\nGrowth in data centre deployments and AI-enabled compute, alongside ongoing strength in consumer mobile is also supporting increased demand for the Group's photonics products.\nStrategic Review\nThe Board is negotiating non-binding offers for the Group as a whole in addition to separate bids for certain other Group assets with a view to maximising shareholder\u00a0value. The Board is encouraged by the level of interest received and the recognition of the intrinsic value of the Group and its component parts.\u00a0Given the nature of such discussions there can be no certainty which, if any, of the these will progress to a completed deal.\nJutta Meier, Chief Executive Officer of IQE, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report a positive second half of trading for IQE in 2025. Coupled with a strong Q1 order book and sustained demand across key end markets, the Company is well-positioned to enter 2026.\nWe continue to advance our Strategic Review and I am encouraged by the progress we are making.

IQE also experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, reflecting continued growth in AI and data centre markets, and increased sales of wireless products tied to new handset introductions which benefitted the Group's Taiwan operations. This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

Even relative to current sales (1X based on estimates for FY 25 and current market cap) or forward sales(surely increasing) is not right, I think. Much more important is how potential purchasers would fit the IP and technical know-how into their business models/processes. Think about someone like Lumentum with a market cap of $25Bn: IQE is an important part of their supply chain and they would not want IQE being taken over by an unfriendly competitor. Hopefully this more positive update with signs that sales are starting to build momentum in multiple areas will make this a sellers, rather than a buyers, transaction if there is a deal. Let's hope the Board have the guts and vision to do the right thing. Remember that until quite recently this was trading at north of \u00a31.00 a share with real momentum. There's no reason why this shouldn't get back there, IMO, so I will keep holding this. Hold onto your hats, folks!",

          "content": "(Alliance News) - IQE PLC shares surged on Monday as it reported positive trading momentum in the second half of 2025, and noted deal interest amid an ongoing strategic review. Shares in IQE jumped 40% to 10.28 pence on Monday afternoon in London. The Cardiff-based supplier of advanced wafer products for the semiconductor industry said trading momentum was strong in the period amid faster than expected funding releases for some US military and defence programmes, which were previously expected for 2026. IQE said it experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, due to continued growth in the artificial intelligence and data centre markets. The firm expects this to result in performance at the upper end of the previously announced 2025 forecast range, with revenue of around GBP97 million resulting in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of at least GBP2.0 million. In 2024, IQE reported revenue of GBP118.0 million and adjusted Ebitda of GBP8.1 million. The company said it has a strong first quarter order book at the beginning of 2025, due to improved demand visibility across segments including consumer mobile, data centre and AI-related photonics markets. The firm added that the board is negotiating non-binding offers for the group as a whole, in addition to separate bids for other group assets, to try to maximise shareholder value. \"The board is encouraged by the level of interest received and the recognition of the intrinsic value of the group and its component parts,\" IQE said. The company said there can be no certainty which, if any, of these will progress to a completed deal. IQE said it has received a waiver from HSBC Holdings PLC on its fourth quarter Ebitda covenant testing due to its \"established and supportive\" relationship with the bank. \"I am pleased to report a positive second half of trading for IQE in 2025. Coupled with a strong Q1 order book and sustained demand across key end markets, the company is well-positioned to enter 2026,\" said Chief Executive Officer Jutta Meier. \"We continue to advance our strategic review and I am encouraged by the progress we are making. I remain confident in the opportunity ahead for the company and look forward to updating the market in due course.\" By Michael Hennessey, Alliance News reporter",

IQE also experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, reflecting continued growth in AI and data centre markets, and increased sales of wireless products tied to new handset introductions which benefitted the Group's Taiwan operations. This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

The compound semiconductor supplier says faster funding releases for some US defence programmes and photonics demand drive performance toward the upper end of its financial 2025 guidance, with revenue of around GBP97 million and adjusted Ebitda of at least GBP2.0 million. IQE also receives a waiver from HSBC Holdings PLC on its fourth-quarter 2025 Ebitda covenant test. Entering 2026, the group reports a \"strong\" first quarter order book. Wireless demand momentum is expected to continue, IQE says. The company adds that it continues to progress its strategic review, with non-binding offers under discussion for the group and selected assets.",

Even relative to current sales (1X based on estimates for FY 25 and current market cap) or forward sales(surely increasing) is not right, I think. Much more important is how potential purchasers would fit the IP and technical know-how into their business models/processes. Think about someone like Lumentum with a market cap of $25Bn: IQE is an important part of their supply chain and they would not want IQE being taken over by an unfriendly competitor. Hopefully this more positive update with signs that sales are starting to build momentum in multiple areas will make this a sellers, rather than a buyers, transaction if there is a deal. Let's hope the Board have the guts and vision to do the right thing. Remember that until quite recently this was trading at north of \u00a31.00 a share with real momentum. There's no reason why this shouldn't get back there, IMO, so I will keep holding this. Hold onto your hats, folks!",

          "content": "(Alliance News) - IQE PLC shares surged on Monday as it reported positive trading momentum in the second half of 2025, and noted deal interest amid an ongoing strategic review. Shares in IQE jumped 40% to 10.28 pence on Monday afternoon in London. The Cardiff-based supplier of advanced wafer products for the semiconductor industry said trading momentum was strong in the period amid faster than expected funding releases for some US military and defence programmes, which were previously expected for 2026. IQE said it experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, due to continued growth in the artificial intelligence and data centre markets. The firm expects this to result in performance at the upper end of the previously announced 2025 forecast range, with revenue of around GBP97 million resulting in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of at least GBP2.0 million. In 2024, IQE reported revenue of GBP118.0 million and adjusted Ebitda of GBP8.1 million. The company said it has a strong first quarter order book at the beginning of 2025, due to improved demand visibility across segments including consumer mobile, data centre and AI-related photonics markets. The firm added that the board is negotiating non-binding offers for the group as a whole, in addition to separate bids for other group assets, to try to maximise shareholder value. \"The board is encouraged by the level of interest received and the recognition of the intrinsic value of the group and its component parts,\" IQE said. The company said there can be no certainty which, if any, of these will progress to a completed deal. IQE said it has received a waiver from HSBC Holdings PLC on its fourth quarter Ebitda covenant testing due to its \"established and supportive\" relationship with the bank. \"I am pleased to report a positive second half of trading for IQE in 2025. Coupled with a strong Q1 order book and sustained demand across key end markets, the company is well-positioned to enter 2026,\" said Chief Executive Officer Jutta Meier. \"We continue to advance our strategic review and I am encouraged by the progress we are making. I remain confident in the opportunity ahead for the company and look forward to updating the market in due course.\" By Michael Hennessey, Alliance News reporter",

The Cardiff-based supplier of advanced wafer products for the semiconductor industry said trading momentum was strong in the period amid faster than expected funding releases for some US military and defence programmes, which were previously expected for 2026. IQE said it experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, due to continued growth in the artificial intelligence and data centre markets. The firm expects this to result in performance at the upper end of the previously announced 2025 forecast range, with revenue of around GBP97 million resulting in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of at least GBP2.0 million. In 2024, IQE reported revenue of GBP118.0 million and adjusted Ebitda of GBP8.1 million. The company said it has a strong first quarter order book at the beginning of 2025, due to improved demand visibility across segments including consumer mobile, data centre and AI-related photonics markets. The firm added that the board is negotiating non-binding offers for the group as a whole, in addition to separate bids for other group assets, to try to maximise shareholder value. \"The board is encouraged by the level of interest received and the recognition of the intrinsic value of the group and its component parts,\" IQE said. The company said there can be no certainty which, if any, of these will progress to a completed deal. IQE said it has received a waiver from HSBC Holdings PLC on its fourth quarter Ebitda covenant testing due to its \"established and supportive\" relationship with the bank. \"I am pleased to report a positive second half of trading for IQE in 2025. Coupled with a strong Q1 order book and sustained demand across key end markets, the company is well-positioned to enter 2026,\" said Chief Executive Officer Jutta Meier. \"We continue to advance our strategic review and I am encouraged by the progress we are making. I remain confident in the opportunity ahead for the company and look forward to updating the market in due course.\"",

          "content": "Light into data: How silicon photonics is powering the AI data center revolution In today\u2019s data-driven world, the demand for higher data transfer, speed, performance and energy efficiency is growing at an unprecedented pace.\u202fSilicon photonics combines the speed of light with the scalability of silicon manufacturing to meet these demands. What exactly is silicon photonics, how does it work \u2013 and crucially, why is it becoming so important? This article explores the fundamentals, applications and impact of silicon photonics. The magic of light on a chip What makes silicon photonics particularly powerful is its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Optical and electronic components can coexist on the same silicon chip by leveraging mature CMOS fabrication processes. This integration allows for mass manufacturing of optical components that were once bulky and expensive and dramatically lowers production costs. light into data silicon photonics How it works Silicon photonics converts electrical signals into optical signals and back again, allowing data to be transmitted as pulses of light. A laser generates a near-infrared light which is then modulated by electrical data signals. These modulators encode information into the light stream by altering properties such as intensity or phase. The modulated light travels through microscopic waveguides etched into the silicon substrate, which guide the light with minimal loss. At the receiving end, photodetectors convert the optical signals back into electrical signals which are translated back to the original data for processing. light into data silicon photonics These conversion and transmission processes enable silicon photonics to deliver ultra-fast data transfer speeds while maintaining energy efficiency.  The ability to integrate these functions on a single chip is a key factor driving its rapid adoption. For instance, STMicroelectronics silicon photonics technologies are already being applied in co-packaged optics for next generation AI and data centers, where optical interconnects deliver data rates above 400 Gbit/s with significantly lower power dissipation than alternative technologies. Powering the digital backbone Silicon photonics is being deployed in several critical sectors. In data centers and cloud computing environments (largely driven by AI demand), the technology enables ultra-fast optical interconnects between servers, storage, and networking equipment. This not only increases data throughput but also reduces power consumption and physical space requirements, helping data centers operate more efficiently and economically. Telecommunications networks also benefit from silicon photonics \u2013 by enabling compact, scalable transceivers, silicon photonics supports higher data rates and longer transmission distances over fiber optic networks, for faster internet speeds",

Regional Dominance: Asia-Pacific is the largest and fastest-growing region (41.37% share in 2025) due to its extensive manufacturing base, with North America holding a 39% share driven by US data center adoption. Key Technologies: The market is dominated by optical transceivers, followed by photonic integrated circuits (PICs), and LiDAR components. Challenges High Costs and Complexity: Manufacturing, particularly packaging and testing, is expensive (28% higher than conventional semiconductors) and technically challenging. Lack of Standardization: The absence of global standards for silicon photonics causes compatibility issues, hindering faster adoption.",

IQE also experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, reflecting continued growth in AI and data centre markets, and increased sales of wireless products tied to new handset introductions which benefitted the Group's Taiwan operations. This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

You can see it clearly on IQE's chart here if you withdraw it either with Candlesticks or OHLC.  Many (but not all) gaps get filled over time. So no great surprise if this eventually revisits circa 7.34 to complete some unfinished business. Frankly, I'd only be slightly concerned if the SP continued drifting well below that.",

          "content": "Light into data: How silicon photonics is powering the AI data center revolution In today\u2019s data-driven world, the demand for higher data transfer, speed, performance and energy efficiency is growing at an unprecedented pace.\u202fSilicon photonics combines the speed of light with the scalability of silicon manufacturing to meet these demands. What exactly is silicon photonics, how does it work \u2013 and crucially, why is it becoming so important? This article explores the fundamentals, applications and impact of silicon photonics. The magic of light on a chip What makes silicon photonics particularly powerful is its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Optical and electronic components can coexist on the same silicon chip by leveraging mature CMOS fabrication processes. This integration allows for mass manufacturing of optical components that were once bulky and expensive and dramatically lowers production costs. light into data silicon photonics How it works Silicon photonics converts electrical signals into optical signals and back again, allowing data to be transmitted as pulses of light. A laser generates a near-infrared light which is then modulated by electrical data signals. These modulators encode information into the light stream by altering properties such as intensity or phase. The modulated light travels through microscopic waveguides etched into the silicon substrate, which guide the light with minimal loss. At the receiving end, photodetectors convert the optical signals back into electrical signals which are translated back to the original data for processing. light into data silicon photonics These conversion and transmission processes enable silicon photonics to deliver ultra-fast data transfer speeds while maintaining energy efficiency.  The ability to integrate these functions on a single chip is a key factor driving its rapid adoption. For instance, STMicroelectronics silicon photonics technologies are already being applied in co-packaged optics for next generation AI and data centers, where optical interconnects deliver data rates above 400 Gbit/s with significantly lower power dissipation than alternative technologies. Powering the digital backbone Silicon photonics is being deployed in several critical sectors. In data centers and cloud computing environments (largely driven by AI demand), the technology enables ultra-fast optical interconnects between servers, storage, and networking equipment. This not only increases data throughput but also reduces power consumption and physical space requirements, helping data centers operate more efficiently and economically. Telecommunications networks also benefit from silicon photonics \u2013 by enabling compact, scalable transceivers, silicon photonics supports higher data rates and longer transmission distances over fiber optic networks, for faster internet speeds",

IQE also experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, reflecting continued growth in AI and data centre markets, and increased sales of wireless products tied to new handset introductions which benefitted the Group's Taiwan operations. This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

The sale was eventually 9p but for a company in serious problems and no real assets. Never understood why. Same seems to be happening here ... however this is selling considerably below the net asset value (even factoring out intangibles). Been tempted to buy in the 7's but hoping to get bigger nibbles at lower.",

That said, you can\u2019t ignore the scale of the losses but the increasing sales hinted at in the RNS is interesting. The most recent RNS does seem to have shifted things slightly. With weak sales and a decline through last year, IQE was negotiating from a position of weakness. That likely explains why the strategy moved from selling just Taiwan to considering a sale of the entire business. Fast-forward a few months and sales are starting to improve, which changes the picture. At the very least, the company now has a stronger hand when it comes to brokering a deal for all or part of the business. It also raises the question of whether a return to selling only Taiwan\u2014this time at a better price\u2014could be enough to clear the debt. With sales picking up, it feels like there are simply more options on the table now. Speculative hold/punt at this stage but with interested parties ongoing for a few months, positive RNS/sales it would make sense a deal sooner rather than later would benefit any purchaser.",

So no great surprise if this eventually revisits circa 7.34 to complete some unfinished business. Frankly, I'd only be slightly concerned if the SP continued drifting well below that.",

          "content": "Light into data: How silicon photonics is powering the AI data center revolution In today\u2019s data-driven world, the demand for higher data transfer, speed, performance and energy efficiency is growing at an unprecedented pace.\u202fSilicon photonics combines the speed of light with the scalability of silicon manufacturing to meet these demands. What exactly is silicon photonics, how does it work \u2013 and crucially, why is it becoming so important? This article explores the fundamentals, applications and impact of silicon photonics. The magic of light on a chip What makes silicon photonics particularly powerful is its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Optical and electronic components can coexist on the same silicon chip by leveraging mature CMOS fabrication processes. This integration allows for mass manufacturing of optical components that were once bulky and expensive and dramatically lowers production costs. light into data silicon photonics How it works Silicon photonics converts electrical signals into optical signals and back again, allowing data to be transmitted as pulses of light. A laser generates a near-infrared light which is then modulated by electrical data signals. These modulators encode information into the light stream by altering properties such as intensity or phase. The modulated light travels through microscopic waveguides etched into the silicon substrate, which guide the light with minimal loss. At the receiving end, photodetectors convert the optical signals back into electrical signals which are translated back to the original data for processing. light into data silicon photonics These conversion and transmission processes enable silicon photonics to deliver ultra-fast data transfer speeds while maintaining energy efficiency.  The ability to integrate these functions on a single chip is a key factor driving its rapid adoption. For instance, STMicroelectronics silicon photonics technologies are already being applied in co-packaged optics for next generation AI and data centers, where optical interconnects deliver data rates above 400 Gbit/s with significantly lower power dissipation than alternative technologies. Powering the digital backbone Silicon photonics is being deployed in several critical sectors. In data centers and cloud computing environments (largely driven by AI demand), the technology enables ultra-fast optical interconnects between servers, storage, and networking equipment. This not only increases data throughput but also reduces power consumption and physical space requirements, helping data centers operate more efficiently and economically. Telecommunications networks also benefit from silicon photonics \u2013 by enabling compact, scalable transceivers, silicon photonics supports higher data rates and longer transmission distances over fiber optic networks, for faster internet speeds",

This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

That said, you can\u2019t ignore the scale of the losses but the increasing sales hinted at in the RNS is interesting. The most recent RNS does seem to have shifted things slightly. With weak sales and a decline through last year, IQE was negotiating from a position of weakness. That likely explains why the strategy moved from selling just Taiwan to considering a sale of the entire business. Fast-forward a few months and sales are starting to improve, which changes the picture. At the very least, the company now has a stronger hand when it comes to brokering a deal for all or part of the business. It also raises the question of whether a return to selling only Taiwan\u2014this time at a better price\u2014could be enough to clear the debt. With sales picking up, it feels like there are simply more options on the table now. Speculative hold/punt at this stage but with interested parties ongoing for a few months, positive RNS/sales it would make sense a deal sooner rather than later would benefit any purchaser.",

You can see it clearly on IQE's chart here if you withdraw it either with Candlesticks or OHLC.  Many (but not all) gaps get filled over time. So no great surprise if this eventually revisits circa 7.34 to complete some unfinished business. Frankly, I'd only be slightly concerned if the SP continued drifting well below that.",

          "content": "Light into data: How silicon photonics is powering the AI data center revolution In today\u2019s data-driven world, the demand for higher data transfer, speed, performance and energy efficiency is growing at an unprecedented pace.\u202fSilicon photonics combines the speed of light with the scalability of silicon manufacturing to meet these demands. What exactly is silicon photonics, how does it work \u2013 and crucially, why is it becoming so important? This article explores the fundamentals, applications and impact of silicon photonics. The magic of light on a chip What makes silicon photonics particularly powerful is its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Optical and electronic components can coexist on the same silicon chip by leveraging mature CMOS fabrication processes. This integration allows for mass manufacturing of optical components that were once bulky and expensive and dramatically lowers production costs. light into data silicon photonics How it works Silicon photonics converts electrical signals into optical signals and back again, allowing data to be transmitted as pulses of light. A laser generates a near-infrared light which is then modulated by electrical data signals. These modulators encode information into the light stream by altering properties such as intensity or phase. The modulated light travels through microscopic waveguides etched into the silicon substrate, which guide the light with minimal loss. At the receiving end, photodetectors convert the optical signals back into electrical signals which are translated back to the original data for processing. light into data silicon photonics These conversion and transmission processes enable silicon photonics to deliver ultra-fast data transfer speeds while maintaining energy efficiency.  The ability to integrate these functions on a single chip is a key factor driving its rapid adoption. For instance, STMicroelectronics silicon photonics technologies are already being applied in co-packaged optics for next generation AI and data centers, where optical interconnects deliver data rates above 400 Gbit/s with significantly lower power dissipation than alternative technologies. Powering the digital backbone Silicon photonics is being deployed in several critical sectors. In data centers and cloud computing environments (largely driven by AI demand), the technology enables ultra-fast optical interconnects between servers, storage, and networking equipment. This not only increases data throughput but also reduces power consumption and physical space requirements, helping data centers operate more efficiently and economically. Telecommunications networks also benefit from silicon photonics \u2013 by enabling compact, scalable transceivers, silicon photonics supports higher data rates and longer transmission distances over fiber optic networks, for faster internet speeds",

IQE also experienced higher than forecast photonics demand in the period, reflecting continued growth in AI and data centre markets, and increased sales of wireless products tied to new handset introductions which benefitted the Group's Taiwan operations. This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

That said, you can\u2019t ignore the scale of the losses but the increasing sales hinted at in the RNS is interesting. The most recent RNS does seem to have shifted things slightly. With weak sales and a decline through last year, IQE was negotiating from a position of weakness. That likely explains why the strategy moved from selling just Taiwan to considering a sale of the entire business. Fast-forward a few months and sales are starting to improve, which changes the picture. At the very least, the company now has a stronger hand when it comes to brokering a deal for all or part of the business. It also raises the question of whether a return to selling only Taiwan\u2014this time at a better price\u2014could be enough to clear the debt. With sales picking up, it feels like there are simply more options on the table now. Speculative hold/punt at this stage but with interested parties ongoing for a few months, positive RNS/sales it would make sense a deal sooner rather than later would benefit any purchaser.",

          "content": "Light into data: How silicon photonics is powering the AI data center revolution In today\u2019s data-driven world, the demand for higher data transfer, speed, performance and energy efficiency is growing at an unprecedented pace.\u202fSilicon photonics combines the speed of light with the scalability of silicon manufacturing to meet these demands. What exactly is silicon photonics, how does it work \u2013 and crucially, why is it becoming so important? This article explores the fundamentals, applications and impact of silicon photonics. The magic of light on a chip What makes silicon photonics particularly powerful is its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Optical and electronic components can coexist on the same silicon chip by leveraging mature CMOS fabrication processes. This integration allows for mass manufacturing of optical components that were once bulky and expensive and dramatically lowers production costs. light into data silicon photonics How it works Silicon photonics converts electrical signals into optical signals and back again, allowing data to be transmitted as pulses of light. A laser generates a near-infrared light which is then modulated by electrical data signals. These modulators encode information into the light stream by altering properties such as intensity or phase. The modulated light travels through microscopic waveguides etched into the silicon substrate, which guide the light with minimal loss. At the receiving end, photodetectors convert the optical signals back into electrical signals which are translated back to the original data for processing. light into data silicon photonics These conversion and transmission processes enable silicon photonics to deliver ultra-fast data transfer speeds while maintaining energy efficiency.  The ability to integrate these functions on a single chip is a key factor driving its rapid adoption. For instance, STMicroelectronics silicon photonics technologies are already being applied in co-packaged optics for next generation AI and data centers, where optical interconnects deliver data rates above 400 Gbit/s with significantly lower power dissipation than alternative technologies. Powering the digital backbone Silicon photonics is being deployed in several critical sectors. In data centers and cloud computing environments (largely driven by AI demand), the technology enables ultra-fast optical interconnects between servers, storage, and networking equipment. This not only increases data throughput but also reduces power consumption and physical space requirements, helping data centers operate more efficiently and economically. Telecommunications networks also benefit from silicon photonics \u2013 by enabling compact, scalable transceivers, silicon photonics supports higher data rates and longer transmission distances over fiber optic networks, for faster internet speeds",

This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves. Additionally, good progress has been made with stakeholders including customers and suppliers to improve near-term liquidity and working capital, resulting in a cash position of \u00a315.6m as at 31 December 2025.\"",

That said, you can\u2019t ignore the scale of the losses but the increasing sales hinted at in the RNS is interesting. The most recent RNS does seem to have shifted things slightly. With weak sales and a decline through last year, IQE was negotiating from a position of weakness. That likely explains why the strategy moved from selling just Taiwan to considering a sale of the entire business. Fast-forward a few months and sales are starting to improve, which changes the picture. At the very least, the company now has a stronger hand when it comes to brokering a deal for all or part of the business. It also raises the question of whether a return to selling only Taiwan\u2014this time at a better price\u2014could be enough to clear the debt. With sales picking up, it feels like there are simply more options on the table now. Speculative hold/punt at this stage but with interested parties ongoing for a few months, positive RNS/sales it would make sense a deal sooner rather than later would benefit any purchaser.",

          "content": "Light into data: How silicon photonics is powering the AI data center revolution In today\u2019s data-driven world, the demand for higher data transfer, speed, performance and energy efficiency is growing at an unprecedented pace.\u202fSilicon photonics combines the speed of light with the scalability of silicon manufacturing to meet these demands. What exactly is silicon photonics, how does it work \u2013 and crucially, why is it becoming so important? This article explores the fundamentals, applications and impact of silicon photonics. The magic of light on a chip What makes silicon photonics particularly powerful is its compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Optical and electronic components can coexist on the same silicon chip by leveraging mature CMOS fabrication processes. This integration allows for mass manufacturing of optical components that were once bulky and expensive and dramatically lowers production costs. light into data silicon photonics How it works Silicon photonics converts electrical signals into optical signals and back again, allowing data to be transmitted as pulses of light. A laser generates a near-infrared light which is then modulated by electrical data signals. These modulators encode information into the light stream by altering properties such as intensity or phase. The modulated light travels through microscopic waveguides etched into the silicon substrate, which guide the light with minimal loss. At the receiving end, photodetectors convert the optical signals back into electrical signals which are translated back to the original data for processing. light into data silicon photonics These conversion and transmission processes enable silicon photonics to deliver ultra-fast data transfer speeds while maintaining energy efficiency.  The ability to integrate these functions on a single chip is a key factor driving its rapid adoption. For instance, STMicroelectronics silicon photonics technologies are already being applied in co-packaged optics for next generation AI and data centers, where optical interconnects deliver data rates above 400 Gbit/s with significantly lower power dissipation than alternative technologies. Powering the digital backbone Silicon photonics is being deployed in several critical sectors. In data centers and cloud computing environments (largely driven by AI demand), the technology enables ultra-fast optical interconnects between servers, storage, and networking equipment. This not only increases data throughput but also reduces power consumption and physical space requirements, helping data centers operate more efficiently and economically. Telecommunications networks also benefit from silicon photonics \u2013 by enabling compact, scalable transceivers, silicon photonics supports higher data rates and longer transmission distances over fiber optic networks, for faster internet speeds",

All will be determined in the coming weeks/months by acquisition deals. Worst scenario will be the sale of part of the business to pay down debt, maintain IQE as a stand alone entity (reduced in size) and delisting, which will be a massive blow to current shareholders. Best case will be an all share offer for \u00a320 per share.",

This is expected to result in a performance at the upper end of the previously announced FY 2025 forecast range[1], with revenue of c.\u00a397m resulting in an adjusted EBITDA position of at least \u00a32.0m due to improved operating leverage as capacity utilisation improves.
