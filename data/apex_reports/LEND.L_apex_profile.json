The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit.\nThe Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m).\nDuring the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m).\nThe Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning. During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs. The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m).\nAs a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability.\nThe Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0in\u00a0March 2026.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nOliver Jackson / Ansh Batura (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Proposals comprised a Tender Offer for up to 1.7 million ZDP Shares, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding those held in treasury), at a Tender Price of 120 pence per ZDP Share, with ZDP Shareholders able to elect to receive the Tender Price in cash or in new Ordinary Shares of equivalent value. In addition, Shareholders were invited to approve the ZDP Amendments, which included the adoption of the New Articles to remove certain restrictions on the Company as detailed in the Circular. As set out above, at the Meetings, all Resolutions were duly passed by the requisite majorities, thereby enabling the Company to proceed with the Tender Offer and to implement the ZDP Amendments as described in the Circular.\nResult of the Tender Offer\nThe Tender Offer to acquire up to 1,700,000 ZDP Shares at a price of 120 pence per ZDP Share closed at 1.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025. A total of 1,700,000 ZDP Shares were validly tendered and accepted under the Tender Offer, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding those held in treasury). All 1,700,000 ZDP Shares validly tendered and accepted under the Tender Offer were tendered by Somerston, the Company's majority shareholder. Accordingly, the Company will purchase an aggregate of 1,700,000 ZDP Shares under the Tender Offer for a total consideration of \u00a32.04 million, calculated at the Tender Offer price of 120 pence per ZDP Share in exchange for the issue of 501,721,593 new Ordinary Shares. Settlement of the Tender Offer will take place in accordance with the terms set out in the Circular. The repurchased ZDP Shares will be cancelled, and settlement is expected to be completed on or around 22 December 2025.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication has been made for the 501,721,593 new Ordinary Shares, to be issued pursuant to the Tender Offer, to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the new\nOrdinary Shares will commence on 22 December 2025.\nImmediately following Admission, the Company will have 1,085,859,939 Ordinary Shares in issue, each with one voting right. There are no Ordinary Shares held in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights will be 1,085,859,939. This figure may be used by shareholders, from Admission, as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine whether they are required to notify their interest under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall, unless defined in this announcement or unless the context provides otherwise, bear the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Circular.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn / Oliver Jackson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TENDER OFFER (AS DEFINED HEREIN) IN OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION IN OR FROM WHICH, OR TO OR FROM ANY PERSON TO OR FROM WHOM, IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE SUCH OFFER UNDER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OR OTHERWISE.\n28 November 2025\nSancus Lending Group Limited\n(\"Sancus\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nProposed Tender Offer for, and\namendments to the terms of the, ZDP Shares\nRelated Party Transactions\nand\nTrading Update\nSancus Lending Group Limited (AIM: LEND) announces proposals to further simplify its capital structure through a tender offer for its existing zero dividend preference shares (\"\nZDP Shares\n\") and related amendments to the rights attaching to the ZDP Shares and a trading update. The proposals, which are more fully described in a circular to ZDP Shareholders and Ordinary Shareholders to be published later today (the \"\nCircular\n\"), are subject to approval at shareholder meetings to be held at the Company's registered office, Suite 1, First Floor, Windsor House, Lower Pollet, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WF, Channel Islands on 19 December 2025, commencing respectively at 10.00 a.m. and 10.05 a.m.\nProposed enhancement to Capital Structure\nThe Company is proposing to launch a tender offer to acquire up to 1,700,000 ZDP Shares, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding ZDP Shares held in treasury), at a tender price of 120.00 pence per ZDP Share (the \"\nTender Offer\n\"). ZDP Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and certain Overseas Shareholders) may elect to receive the Tender Price either in cash (the \"\nCash Option\n\") or in new Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company (the \"\nOrdinary Shares Option\n\"), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Circular.\u200b\nConcurrently with the Tender Offer, the Company is proposing amendments to the terms of the ZDP Shares (the \"\nZDP Amendments\n\") by way of the adoption of new articles of incorporation (the \"\nNew Articles\n\"), which will remove certain historic restrictions on the Company while preserving the existing ZDP maturity date of 5 December 2030 and the final capital entitlement of 209.90 pence per ZDP Share (the \"\nFinal Capital Entitlement\n\"). Following implementation of the Tender Offer and ZDP Amendments, the Board expects the Group to benefit from a simpler capital structure with a reduced Final Capital Entitlement and increased operational and financing flexibility.\u200b\nThe Circular (including the Notice of the ZDP Class Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting), Tender Form and Forms of Proxy will be posted to Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders later today and will also be available\u00a0on the Company's website at:\nhttps://corporate.sancus.com/investor-relations/\n.\nTrading Update\nSince the Company's results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025, the Company has continued to trade in line with the Board's expectations.\nIn the ten months to 31 October 2025 the Group generated revenues of \u00a316.7 million versus \u00a313.4 million in the ten months to 31 October 2024. In the ten months to 31 October 2025, the Group wrote \u00a3146.7 million of new loan facilities versus \u00a375.6 million in the ten months to 31 October 2024. As at 31 October, loans under management were \u00a3301 million (31 October 2024: \u00a3209.7 million). The Company continues to experience stable credit quality. Notwithstanding that the Group's UK and Channel Islands business continue to operate in an uncertain market environment the Board is confident of achieving further growth in its loan volumes and revenues for the remainder of 2025 as it continues to work towards achieving long term operating profitability.\nDetails of the Tender Offer\nUnder the Tender Offer, each eligible ZDP Shareholder whose name appears on the register at 6.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025 (the \"\nRecord Date\n\") will be entitled to tender up to 100 per cent. of their ZDP Shareholding at the Tender Price (their \"\nTender Entitlement\n\"). ZDP Shareholders who successfully tender ZDP Shares will receive the Tender Price per ZDP Share either in cash under the Cash Option or via the issue of new Ordinary Shares under the Ordinary Shares Option, with the Ordinary Shares to be issued at a price equal to the volume\n\u2011\nweighted average of the mid\n\u2011\nmarket prices of the Ordinary Shares for the five Business Days prior to the date of the Circular, being 0.4066 pence per Ordinary Share .\u200b\nThe maximum number of ZDP Shares that the Company will be obliged to purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer is 1,700,000 with any ZDP Shares purchased to be cancelled. The Tender Offer is conditional,\ninter alia\n, on the passing of the requisite shareholder resolution at the Extraordinary General Meeting (\"\nEGM\n\") authorising the Company to acquire ZDP Shares off\n\u2011\nmarket, the Board being satisfied that the Company will meet the statutory solvency test under Guernsey company law immediately following completion, and the Tender Offer not having been terminated in accordance with the terms set out in the Circular.\u200b\nZDP Amendments\nThe ZDP Amendments will be implemented through the adoption of the New Articles, which will set out the revised rights attaching to the ZDP Shares with effect from the date of approval at the EGM (the \"\nZDP Amendment Resolution\n\"). Under the New Articles, the ZDP Shares will: (i) continue to provide a right to be redeemed on 5 December 2030 at the Final Capital Entitlement of 209.90 pence per ZDP Share (subject to the solvency test under Guernsey company law); and (ii) continue not to accrue any further capital growth, reflecting changes approved earlier in June 2025.\u200b\nCertain historic protections which currently restrict the Company's ability, without prior ZDP Shareholder approval, to undertake specified corporate and financing actions (including, among other things, incurring certain levels of borrowings, issuing share capital ranking ahead of or pari passu with the ZDP Shares, and effecting certain capital reductions) will be removed, as described in detail in Part 1 and Part 3 of the Circular. The Board believes that, given the expected reduction in the number of ZDP Shares in issue and the corresponding reduction in the aggregate Final Capital Entitlement, these restrictions are no longer appropriate and that the ZDP Amendments are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.\u200b\nShareholder meetings and timetable\nImplementation of the Tender Offer and the ZDP Amendments is subject to the approval of ZDP Shareholders at a class meeting (the \"\nZDP Class Meeting\n\") and of Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders at the EGM (together, the \"\nMeetings\n\"). The ZDP Class Meeting has been convened for 10.00 a.m. on 19 December 2025, to be followed by the EGM at 10.05 a.m. (or as soon thereafter as the ZDP Class Meeting has been concluded or adjourned), in each case at the Company's registered office, Suite 1, First Floor, Windsor House, Lower Pollet, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WF, Channel Islands.\u200b\nThe latest time and date for receipt of forms of proxy for the ZDP Class Meeting is 10.00 a.m. on 17 December 2025 and for the EGM is 10.05 a.m. on 17 December 2025, and the latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms and associated share certificates (or other documents of title) in respect of the Tender Offer is 1.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025. Subject to the Conditions being satisfied, the Tender Offer is expected to close at 1.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025, with the results of the Meetings and the total number of ZDP Shares validly tendered expected to be announced on 19 December 2025 and settlement of consideration (cash and/or new Ordinary Shares) to occur on or around 22 December 2025.\u200b\nRelated Party Transactions\nSomerston Fintech Limited (\"\nSomerston Fintech\n\"), a member of Somerston Group Limited (together, \"\nSomerston\n\"), is a Substantial Shareholder in the Company and is therefore a related party for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). Somerston has undertaken to tender all of its ZDP Shares under the Tender Offer, electing for the Ordinary Shares Option, and to vote in favour of all resolutions to be proposed at the Meetings, with Somerston Fintech's tender to be subject to scaling\n\u2011\nback to ensure that non\n\u2011\nSomerston ZDP Shareholders are able to achieve a full exit under the Tender Offer.\u200b\nSomerston Fintech's participation in the Tender Offer and the ZDP Amendments in respect of the ZDP Shares held by Somerston Fintech each constitute related party transactions under AIM Rule 13, in respect of which the Independent Directors, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Shore Capital and Corporate Limited (\"\nShore Capital\n\"), consider the terms to be fair and reasonable insofar as Ordinary Shareholders are concerned.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall, unless defined in this announcement or unless the context provides otherwise, bear the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Circular.\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer of Sancus, commented:\n\"These proposals mark another important step in simplifying our capital structure and enhancing the Group's financial flexibility.\nThe Tender Offer provides an opportunity for ZDP Shareholders to realise value on attractive terms, while the proposed amendments will give the Group greater flexibility to support its expanding loan book. Trading remains robust and, with continued momentum across our markets, we are confident that these changes will support Sancus in delivering sustainable progress for all stakeholders.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn / Oliver Jackson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nLETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF SANCUS CONTAINED IN THE CIRCULAR\n1\nIntroduction\nEarlier\ntoday,\nthe\nCompany\nannounced\nProposals\nto\nfurther\nsimplify\nits\ncapital\nstructure.\nThe\nCompany\nis\nproposing to make a Tender Offer for up to 1.7 million ZDP Shares, being equal to approximately 52 per\ncent.\nof\nthe\nissued\nZDP\nShares\n(excluding\nZDP\nShares\nheld\nin\ntreasury)\nat\na\nTender\nPrice\nof\n120\npence\nper\nZDP Share (the \"\nTender Price\n\") (the \"\nTender Offer\n\"). In the Tender Offer, tendering ZDP Shareholders may\nchoose to receive the Tender Price in cash (the \"\nCash Option\n\") or alternatively to receive new Ordinary Shares of equivalent value (the \"\nOrdinary Shares Option\n\").\nGiven what is expected to be a significant reduction in the number of ZDP Shares in issue following the Tender Offer and also as a result of recent tender offers and buybacks by the Company, the Company is\nalso\nproposing\namendments\nto\nthe\nterms\nof\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nto\nremove\ncertain\nrestrictions\non\nthe\nCompany\n(the \"\nZDP Amendments\n\" and, together with the Tender Offer, the \"\nProposals\n\").\nThe Proposals have the support of Somerston Group, the Company's largest Shareholder. Somerston Fintech is entitled to vote on the Proposals at the Meetings and has undertaken to vote in favour of all Resolutions. Somerston Fintech has also undertaken to accept the Tender Offer in full, for the Ordinary Shares Option. As Somerston Fintech's holding of ZDP Shares exceeds the maximum number of ZDP Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer is being made, its tender will, if required, be scaled back to allow non-Somerston ZDP Shareholders a full exit of their investment in ZDP Shares at the Tender Price.\nThese proposals are intended to further simplify the Company's capital structure and enhance its corporate\nflexibility, including to significantly reduce and manage the Company's future obligation to pay the Final Capital Entitlement in respect of the ZDP Shares, and remove restrictions on the Company that were established when the ZDP Shares were first issued.\nThe Tender Offer requires the approval of Ordinary Shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The ZDP Amendments require the approval of both Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders at the Meetings.\nThe purpose of this document is to provide Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders with details of the Proposals and set out the reasons why the Independent Directors recommend that you vote in favour of the Proposals. As a holder of both Ordinary Shares and ZDP Shares, Somerston Fintech is entitled to vote on the Proposals and has irrevocably undertaken to vote in favour of the Resolutions, so each of the Resolutions is expected to be passed.\nThis\ndocument\nalso\ncontains\nthe\nterms\nand\nconditions\nof\nthe\nTender\nOffer,\ntogether\nwith\ndetails\nof\nhow\nZDP\nShareholders\ncan\ntender\nZDP\nShares\nin\nconsideration\nfor\nOrdinary\nShares\nor\na\ncash\nTender\nPrice,\nif\nthey\nwish and are eligible to do so.\n2\nCompany overview and trading\nupdate\nOn 4 September 2025, the Company published its unaudited interim results for the six months ended\n30\nJune\n2025.\nThe\ninterim\nresults\nare\navailable\non\nthe\nCompany's\nwebsite\n(https://corporate.sancus.com/)\nand some highlights are extracted below.\n\"The Group has had an encouraging start to 2025.

The ZDP Maturity Date is 5 December 2030, on which date the holders of ZDP Shares are entitled to receive\nfrom\nthe\nCompany\n209.90\npence\nfor\neach\nZDP\nShare\nthat\nthey\nhold.\nThe\nFinal\nCapital\nEntitlement\nis\nto be paid by way of the redemption of the ZDP Shares, and under the Articles and applicable company\nlaw\nthe\nCompany\nmay\nonly\nredeem\nsuch\nShares\nto\nthe\nextent\nthat\nthe\nBoard\nis\ncomfortable\nthat,\nafter\nsuch redemption, the Company can satisfy the solvency test prescribed by Guernsey company law.\nIn\nthe\nevent\nthat\nthe\nCompany\ncannot\nredeem\nthe\nZDP\nShares\non\nthe\nmaturity\ndate,\nthe\nZDP\nholders\ndo not have any rights to force redemption.\nFollowing\nthe\nproposals\nadopted\nearlier\nin\n2025,\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nare\nnot\naccruing\nany\nfurther\ncapital\ngrowth, which should be considered by ZDP Shareholders when assessing whether to accept the Tender Offer.\nThe Company has, in the past, utilised available cash funds to acquire ZDP Shares (through on-market\nbuybacks\nand\ntender\noffers)\nwith\na\nview\nto\nreducing\nthe\nquantum\nof\nthe\nFinal\nCapital\nEntitlement.\nThe\nTender Offer is expected to significantly reduce that amount further.\nSomerston Group, the Company's majority Ordinary Shareholder, is also a major ZDP Shareholder\nand\nhas\nacquired\nfurther\nZDP\nShares\nin\nrecent\nyears\nas\nwell\nas\nseeing\nits\npercentage\nholding\nof\nZDP Shares\nincrease\nby\nthe\ntender\noffer\nfor\nZDP\nShares\nthat\nwas\nmade\nby\nthe\nCompany\nin\nJune\n2025.\nAs\nat the date of this document, Somerston holds 96.9 per cent. of the ZDP Shares in issue\n2\n.\nFollowing completion of the Tender Offer, and given Somerston's irrevocable undertaking to accept\nthe Tender Offer in full (subject to scale back) for the Ordinary Shares Option, the Company anticipates\nthat there will be 1,562,506 ZDP Shares\n2\nin issue. This will represent a very small proportion of the Company's overall capital base.\nThe\nExisting\nArticles\nset\nout\ncertain\nprotections\nfor\nZDP\nShareholders\nafforded\nby\nundertakings\nby\nthe\nCompany not to, without the prior sanction of ZDP Shareholders, take certain actions. These\nrestrictions were established when the ZDP Shares were first issued and apply regardless of how many\nremain outstanding. The Board believes that, following completion of the Tender Offer, it would no longer be appropriate for the Company to be restricted by these provisions given the relatively low number of ZDP Shares that would remain in issue and the associated materially reduced potential\nliability associated with the Final Capital Entitlement. Accordingly, the ZDP Amendments would remove\nsome, but not all, of these protections as set out in paragraph 4.2 below.\nThe present Proposals are consistent with the view expressed by the Board in June 2025 that the\nCompany\nwill\nbenefit\nfrom\na\nsimpler\ncapital\nstructure\nwith\na\ndecreased\nemphasis\non\nthe\nZDP\nShares.\nThe Ordinary Shares Option is being made available to ZDP Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and certain Overseas Shareholders as explained in paragraph 11 of Part 2 of this document) to allow those ZDP Shareholders who wish to do so to exchange their holding of ZDP Shares for new Ordinary Shares at the Tender Price.\nThe\nBoard\nbelieves\nthat\nthe\nProposals\nare\nin\nthe\nbest\ninterests\nof\nthe\nOrdinary\nShareholders\nand\nafford\nZDP Shareholders an opportunity to exit their investment in full.\nZDP Shareholders who wish to continue to hold ZDP Shares, as amended, may do so. As noted in paragraph A.1 of Part 5 of this document, UK resident ZDP Shareholders should generally not be treated as making a disposal for the purposes of UK taxation of chargeable gains as a result of the ZDP Amendments. It is important to note that the discussion of the tax treatment contained in Part 5 of this document is intended only as a general and non-exhaustive summary of the expected tax treatment and ZDP Shareholders are advised to seek independent professional advice as to the tax consequences for them of the Proposals.\nNothing in this document constitutes or should be construed or relied upon as legal or tax advice.\n4.2\nKey Features of the amended ZDP\nShares\nIf\nthe\nZDP\nAmendments\nare\nadopted,\nthe\nZDP\nShares:\n\u25cf\nwill continue to have a repayment date of 5 December 2030 at a redemption price of 209.90 pence, subject to the Company having sufficient assets at the time to satisfy the solvency test set out under Guernsey company law;\n\u25cf\nwill\ncontinue\nto\nsee\nno\nfurther\ncapital\ngrowth;\n\u25cf\nwill continue to have the protections afforded by undertakings by the Company not to, without the prior sanction of ZDP Shareholders:\n\u274d\npass\na\nresolution\nreleasing\nthe\nDirectors\nfrom\ntheir\nobligation\nto\nredeem\nthe\nZDP\nShares\non\nthe ZDP Maturity Date;\n\u274d\npass\na\nresolution\nfor\nthe\nvoluntary\nwinding\nup\nor\nliquidation\nof\nthe\nCompany,\nsuch\nwinding\nup to take effect prior to the ZDP Maturity Date; or\n\u274d\npass\nany\nresolution\nto\nvary,\nmodify\nor\nabrogate\nany\nof\nthe\nspecial\nrights\nattached\nto\nthe\nZDP\nShares; and\n\u25cf\nwill\ncease\nto have the protections afforded by undertakings by the Company not to, without the prior sanction of ZDP Shareholders:\n\u274d\npay\ndividends\nto\nholders\nof\nOrdinary\nShares\nin\nexcess\nof\nan\namount\nset\nout\nin\nthe\nExisting Articles;\n\u274d\nissue further shares or securities, or rights to subscribe for or to convert or exchange any\nsecurities\ninto\nshares\nor\nsecurities\nor\nreclassify\nissued\nshare\ncapital\ninto\nshares\nor\nsecurities of a particular class where such shares or securities would on issue, conversion, exchange\nor\nreclassification\nrank\nas\nto\ncapital\nin\npriority\nto\nor\npari\npassu\nwith\nthe\nZDP\nShares,\nsubject\nto a Cover Test;\n2\nExcluding\ntreasury\nshares.\n\u274d\npass\na\nresolution\nto\nreduce\nthe\ncapital\nof\nthe\nCompany,\nsubject\nto\na\nCover\nTest;\n\u274d\nincur any borrowings in excess of \u00a330 million (subject to certain exclusions) or guarantee the indebtedness of any of its subsidiaries;\n\u274d\nmake\nany\nmaterial\nchange\nto\nthe\naccounting\npolicies\nadopted\nby\nthe\nCompany;\nor\n\u274d\nmake a material change to the business of the Company as a whole, which at the time of making such change, appears likely in the reasonable opinion of the Directors to be materially prejudicial to the holders of the ZDP Shares.\nThe foregoing list is a summary of the protections attaching to the ZDP Shares that are proposed to\nbe removed pursuant to the ZDP Amendments. The full text of these provisions is set out in the Existing\nArticles and also (in the form of a comparison document showing the changes between the two) the New Articles, both of which are available for inspection as set out in Part 6 of this document.\nSave\nas\nset\nout\nabove,\nthe\nrights\nof\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nfollowing\nthe\nimplementation\nof\nthe\nProposals\nwill\nbe\nthe\nsame\nas\nthe\nrights\nof\nthe\nexisting\nZDP\nShares.\nThe\namended\nrights\nof\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nare\nset\nout in the New Articles and are described in full in Part 3 of this document.\nThe ability of the Company to pay the Final Capital Entitlement is dependent on the\nperformance\nof\nthe\nCompany's\nbusiness\nand\ninvestments.\nZDP\nShares\nare\nnot\na\nguaranteed,\nprotected or secured investment and ZDP Shareholders may therefore not receive their full Final Capital Entitlement.\n4.3\nAdoption of the New\nArticles\nThe\nZDP\nAmendments\nwill\nbe\nimplemented\nby\nway\nof\nthe\nadoption\nof\nthe\nNew\nArticles.\nThe New Articles contain the amended rights attaching to the ZDP Shares as set out in Part 3 of this document.

Following the ZDP Amendments, ZDP Shareholders shall continue to hold\nZDP Shares on the amended terms as set out in the New Articles. In the case of any discrepancy between this document and the New Articles, the terms of the New Articles will prevail.\n4.4\nDealings in ZDP\nShares\nNo new securities will be issued by the Company in connection with the ZDP Amendments and the ZDP Shares will continue to be held by ZDP Shareholders, albeit on the revised terms of the ZDP\nAmendments.\nZDP Shareholders will not receive replacement share certificates in respect of their ZDP Shares (unless\nthey\nare\nelecting\nfor\nthe\nOrdinary\nShares\nOption\nin\nthe\nTender\nOffer\nor\nare\naccepting\nthe\nTender\nOffer\nin respect of some but not all of their ZDP Shares).\nAlthough\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nremain\nfreely\ntradeable,\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nare\nnot\nadmitted\nto\ntrading\non\nany\nmarket\nor\nstock\nexchange\nand\nno\nformal\nfacility\n(such\nas\nCREST)\nis\navailable\nto\nfacilitate\nthe\ntrading\nof\nthe ZDP Shares.
