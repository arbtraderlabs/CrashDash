The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit.\nThe Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m).\nDuring the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m).\nThe Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning. During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs. The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m).\nAs a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability.\nThe Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0in\u00a0March 2026.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nOliver Jackson / Ansh Batura (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Proposals comprised a Tender Offer for up to 1.7 million ZDP Shares, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding those held in treasury), at a Tender Price of 120 pence per ZDP Share, with ZDP Shareholders able to elect to receive the Tender Price in cash or in new Ordinary Shares of equivalent value. In addition, Shareholders were invited to approve the ZDP Amendments, which included the adoption of the New Articles to remove certain restrictions on the Company as detailed in the Circular. As set out above, at the Meetings, all Resolutions were duly passed by the requisite majorities, thereby enabling the Company to proceed with the Tender Offer and to implement the ZDP Amendments as described in the Circular.\nResult of the Tender Offer\nThe Tender Offer to acquire up to 1,700,000 ZDP Shares at a price of 120 pence per ZDP Share closed at 1.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025. A total of 1,700,000 ZDP Shares were validly tendered and accepted under the Tender Offer, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding those held in treasury). All 1,700,000 ZDP Shares validly tendered and accepted under the Tender Offer were tendered by Somerston, the Company's majority shareholder. Accordingly, the Company will purchase an aggregate of 1,700,000 ZDP Shares under the Tender Offer for a total consideration of \u00a32.04 million, calculated at the Tender Offer price of 120 pence per ZDP Share in exchange for the issue of 501,721,593 new Ordinary Shares. Settlement of the Tender Offer will take place in accordance with the terms set out in the Circular. The repurchased ZDP Shares will be cancelled, and settlement is expected to be completed on or around 22 December 2025.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication has been made for the 501,721,593 new Ordinary Shares, to be issued pursuant to the Tender Offer, to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the new\nOrdinary Shares will commence on 22 December 2025.\nImmediately following Admission, the Company will have 1,085,859,939 Ordinary Shares in issue, each with one voting right. There are no Ordinary Shares held in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights will be 1,085,859,939. This figure may be used by shareholders, from Admission, as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine whether they are required to notify their interest under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall, unless defined in this announcement or unless the context provides otherwise, bear the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Circular.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn / Oliver Jackson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The proposals, which are more fully described in a circular to ZDP Shareholders and Ordinary Shareholders to be published later today (the \"\nCircular\n\"), are subject to approval at shareholder meetings to be held at the Company's registered office, Suite 1, First Floor, Windsor House, Lower Pollet, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WF, Channel Islands on 19 December 2025, commencing respectively at 10.00 a.m. and 10.05 a.m.\nProposed enhancement to Capital Structure\nThe Company is proposing to launch a tender offer to acquire up to 1,700,000 ZDP Shares, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding ZDP Shares held in treasury), at a tender price of 120.00 pence per ZDP Share (the \"\nTender Offer\n\"). ZDP Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and certain Overseas Shareholders) may elect to receive the Tender Price either in cash (the \"\nCash Option\n\") or in new Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company (the \"\nOrdinary Shares Option\n\"), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Circular.\u200b\nConcurrently with the Tender Offer, the Company is proposing amendments to the terms of the ZDP Shares (the \"\nZDP Amendments\n\") by way of the adoption of new articles of incorporation (the \"\nNew Articles\n\"), which will remove certain historic restrictions on the Company while preserving the existing ZDP maturity date of 5 December 2030 and the final capital entitlement of 209.90 pence per ZDP Share (the \"\nFinal Capital Entitlement\n\"). Following implementation of the Tender Offer and ZDP Amendments, the Board expects the Group to benefit from a simpler capital structure with a reduced Final Capital Entitlement and increased operational and financing flexibility.\u200b\nThe Circular (including the Notice of the ZDP Class Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting), Tender Form and Forms of Proxy will be posted to Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders later today and will also be available\u00a0on the Company's website at:\nhttps://corporate.sancus.com/investor-relations/\n.\nTrading Update\nSince the Company's results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025, the Company has continued to trade in line with the Board's expectations.\nIn the ten months to 31 October 2025 the Group generated revenues of \u00a316.7 million versus \u00a313.4 million in the ten months to 31 October 2024. In the ten months to 31 October 2025, the Group wrote \u00a3146.7 million of new loan facilities versus \u00a375.6 million in the ten months to 31 October 2024. As at 31 October, loans under management were \u00a3301 million (31 October 2024: \u00a3209.7 million). The Company continues to experience stable credit quality. Notwithstanding that the Group's UK and Channel Islands business continue to operate in an uncertain market environment the Board is confident of achieving further growth in its loan volumes and revenues for the remainder of 2025 as it continues to work towards achieving long term operating profitability.\nDetails of the Tender Offer\nUnder the Tender Offer, each eligible ZDP Shareholder whose name appears on the register at 6.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025 (the \"\nRecord Date\n\") will be entitled to tender up to 100 per cent. of their ZDP Shareholding at the Tender Price (their \"\nTender Entitlement\n\"). ZDP Shareholders who successfully tender ZDP Shares will receive the Tender Price per ZDP Share either in cash under the Cash Option or via the issue of new Ordinary Shares under the Ordinary Shares Option, with the Ordinary Shares to be issued at a price equal to the volume\n\u2011\nweighted average of the mid\n\u2011\nmarket prices of the Ordinary Shares for the five Business Days prior to the date of the Circular, being 0.4066 pence per Ordinary Share .\u200b\nThe maximum number of ZDP Shares that the Company will be obliged to purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer is 1,700,000 with any ZDP Shares purchased to be cancelled. The Tender Offer is conditional,\ninter alia\n, on the passing of the requisite shareholder resolution at the Extraordinary General Meeting (\"\nEGM\n\") authorising the Company to acquire ZDP Shares off\n\u2011\nmarket, the Board being satisfied that the Company will meet the statutory solvency test under Guernsey company law immediately following completion, and the Tender Offer not having been terminated in accordance with the terms set out in the Circular.\u200b\nZDP Amendments\nThe ZDP Amendments will be implemented through the adoption of the New Articles, which will set out the revised rights attaching to the ZDP Shares with effect from the date of approval at the EGM (the \"\nZDP Amendment Resolution\n\"). Under the New Articles, the ZDP Shares will: (i) continue to provide a right to be redeemed on 5 December 2030 at the Final Capital Entitlement of 209.90 pence per ZDP Share (subject to the solvency test under Guernsey company law); and (ii) continue not to accrue any further capital growth, reflecting changes approved earlier in June 2025.\u200b\nCertain historic protections which currently restrict the Company's ability, without prior ZDP Shareholder approval, to undertake specified corporate and financing actions (including, among other things, incurring certain levels of borrowings, issuing share capital ranking ahead of or pari passu with the ZDP Shares, and effecting certain capital reductions) will be removed, as described in detail in Part 1 and Part 3 of the Circular. The Board believes that, given the expected reduction in the number of ZDP Shares in issue and the corresponding reduction in the aggregate Final Capital Entitlement, these restrictions are no longer appropriate and that the ZDP Amendments are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.\u200b\nShareholder meetings and timetable\nImplementation of the Tender Offer and the ZDP Amendments is subject to the approval of ZDP Shareholders at a class meeting (the \"\nZDP Class Meeting\n\") and of Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders at the EGM (together, the \"\nMeetings\n\"). The ZDP Class Meeting has been convened for 10.00 a.m. on 19 December 2025, to be followed by the EGM at 10.05 a.m. (or as soon thereafter as the ZDP Class Meeting has been concluded or adjourned), in each case at the Company's registered office, Suite 1, First Floor, Windsor House, Lower Pollet, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WF, Channel Islands.\u200b\nThe latest time and date for receipt of forms of proxy for the ZDP Class Meeting is 10.00 a.m. on 17 December 2025 and for the EGM is 10.05 a.m. on 17 December 2025, and the latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms and associated share certificates (or other documents of title) in respect of the Tender Offer is 1.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025. Subject to the Conditions being satisfied, the Tender Offer is expected to close at 1.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025, with the results of the Meetings and the total number of ZDP Shares validly tendered expected to be announced on 19 December 2025 and settlement of consideration (cash and/or new Ordinary Shares) to occur on or around 22 December 2025.\u200b\nRelated Party Transactions\nSomerston Fintech Limited (\"\nSomerston Fintech\n\"), a member of Somerston Group Limited (together, \"\nSomerston\n\"), is a Substantial Shareholder in the Company and is therefore a related party for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). Somerston has undertaken to tender all of its ZDP Shares under the Tender Offer, electing for the Ordinary Shares Option, and to vote in favour of all resolutions to be proposed at the Meetings, with Somerston Fintech's tender to be subject to scaling\n\u2011\nback to ensure that non\n\u2011\nSomerston ZDP Shareholders are able to achieve a full exit under the Tender Offer.\u200b\nSomerston Fintech's participation in the Tender Offer and the ZDP Amendments in respect of the ZDP Shares held by Somerston Fintech each constitute related party transactions under AIM Rule 13, in respect of which the Independent Directors, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Shore Capital and Corporate Limited (\"\nShore Capital\n\"), consider the terms to be fair and reasonable insofar as Ordinary Shareholders are concerned.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall, unless defined in this announcement or unless the context provides otherwise, bear the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Circular.\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer of Sancus, commented:\n\"These proposals mark another important step in simplifying our capital structure and enhancing the Group's financial flexibility.\nThe Tender Offer provides an opportunity for ZDP Shareholders to realise value on attractive terms, while the proposed amendments will give the Group greater flexibility to support its expanding loan book. Trading remains robust and, with continued momentum across our markets, we are confident that these changes will support Sancus in delivering sustainable progress for all stakeholders.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn / Oliver Jackson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nLETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF SANCUS CONTAINED IN THE CIRCULAR\n1\nIntroduction\nEarlier\ntoday,\nthe\nCompany\nannounced\nProposals\nto\nfurther\nsimplify\nits\ncapital\nstructure.\nThe\nCompany\nis\nproposing to make a Tender Offer for up to 1.7 million ZDP Shares, being equal to approximately 52 per\ncent.\nof\nthe\nissued\nZDP\nShares\n(excluding\nZDP\nShares\nheld\nin\ntreasury)\nat\na\nTender\nPrice\nof\n120\npence\nper\nZDP Share (the \"\nTender Price\n\") (the \"\nTender Offer\n\"). In the Tender Offer, tendering ZDP Shareholders may\nchoose to receive the Tender Price in cash (the \"\nCash Option\n\") or alternatively to receive new Ordinary Shares of equivalent value (the \"\nOrdinary Shares Option\n\").\nGiven what is expected to be a significant reduction in the number of ZDP Shares in issue following the Tender Offer and also as a result of recent tender offers and buybacks by the Company, the Company is\nalso\nproposing\namendments\nto\nthe\nterms\nof\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nto\nremove\ncertain\nrestrictions\non\nthe\nCompany\n(the \"\nZDP Amendments\n\" and, together with the Tender Offer, the \"\nProposals\n\").\nThe Proposals have the support of Somerston Group, the Company's largest Shareholder. Somerston Fintech is entitled to vote on the Proposals at the Meetings and has undertaken to vote in favour of all Resolutions. Somerston Fintech has also undertaken to accept the Tender Offer in full, for the Ordinary Shares Option. As Somerston Fintech's holding of ZDP Shares exceeds the maximum number of ZDP Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer is being made, its tender will, if required, be scaled back to allow non-Somerston ZDP Shareholders a full exit of their investment in ZDP Shares at the Tender Price.\nThese proposals are intended to further simplify the Company's capital structure and enhance its corporate\nflexibility, including to significantly reduce and manage the Company's future obligation to pay the Final Capital Entitlement in respect of the ZDP Shares, and remove restrictions on the Company that were established when the ZDP Shares were first issued.\nThe Tender Offer requires the approval of Ordinary Shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The ZDP Amendments require the approval of both Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders at the Meetings.\nThe purpose of this document is to provide Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders with details of the Proposals and set out the reasons why the Independent Directors recommend that you vote in favour of the Proposals. As a holder of both Ordinary Shares and ZDP Shares, Somerston Fintech is entitled to vote on the Proposals and has irrevocably undertaken to vote in favour of the Resolutions, so each of the Resolutions is expected to be passed.\nThis\ndocument\nalso\ncontains\nthe\nterms\nand\nconditions\nof\nthe\nTender\nOffer,\ntogether\nwith\ndetails\nof\nhow\nZDP\nShareholders\ncan\ntender\nZDP\nShares\nin\nconsideration\nfor\nOrdinary\nShares\nor\na\ncash\nTender\nPrice,\nif\nthey\nwish and are eligible to do so.\n2\nCompany overview and trading\nupdate\nOn 4 September 2025, the Company published its unaudited interim results for the six months ended\n30\nJune\n2025.\nThe\ninterim\nresults\nare\navailable\non\nthe\nCompany's\nwebsite\n(https://corporate.sancus.com/)\nand some highlights are extracted below.\n\"The Group has had an encouraging start to 2025.

The Ordinary Shares have been admitted to trading on AIM since August 2005. The ZDP Shares were issued in December 2014 and were traded on the main market of the London Stock Exchange\nbetween\nOctober\n2015\nand\nDecember\n2024.\nAs\nat\nthe\ndate\nof\nthis\ndocument,\nthe\nCompany's\nissued\nshare capital comprises 584,138,346 Ordinary Shares\n2\nand 3,262,506 ZDP Shares\n2\n.\nThe ZDP Shares are non-participating and non-voting (except in certain limited circumstances, including at the ZDP Class Meeting and on Resolution 2 at the Extraordinary General Meeting) but carry the right to the repayment of a Final Capital Entitlement on the ZDP Maturity Date. The ZDP Maturity Date is 5 December 2030, on which date the holders of ZDP Shares are entitled to receive\nfrom\nthe\nCompany\n209.90\npence\nfor\neach\nZDP\nShare\nthat\nthey\nhold.\nThe\nFinal\nCapital\nEntitlement\nis\nto be paid by way of the redemption of the ZDP Shares, and under the Articles and applicable company\nlaw\nthe\nCompany\nmay\nonly\nredeem\nsuch\nShares\nto\nthe\nextent\nthat\nthe\nBoard\nis\ncomfortable\nthat,\nafter\nsuch redemption, the Company can satisfy the solvency test prescribed by Guernsey company law.\nIn\nthe\nevent\nthat\nthe\nCompany\ncannot\nredeem\nthe\nZDP\nShares\non\nthe\nmaturity\ndate,\nthe\nZDP\nholders\ndo not have any rights to force redemption.\nFollowing\nthe\nproposals\nadopted\nearlier\nin\n2025,\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nare\nnot\naccruing\nany\nfurther\ncapital\ngrowth, which should be considered by ZDP Shareholders when assessing whether to accept the Tender Offer.\nThe Company has, in the past, utilised available cash funds to acquire ZDP Shares (through on-market\nbuybacks\nand\ntender\noffers)\nwith\na\nview\nto\nreducing\nthe\nquantum\nof\nthe\nFinal\nCapital\nEntitlement.\nThe\nTender Offer is expected to significantly reduce that amount further.\nSomerston Group, the Company's majority Ordinary Shareholder, is also a major ZDP Shareholder\nand\nhas\nacquired\nfurther\nZDP\nShares\nin\nrecent\nyears\nas\nwell\nas\nseeing\nits\npercentage\nholding\nof\nZDP Shares\nincrease\nby\nthe\ntender\noffer\nfor\nZDP\nShares\nthat\nwas\nmade\nby\nthe\nCompany\nin\nJune\n2025.\nAs\nat the date of this document, Somerston holds 96.9 per cent. of the ZDP Shares in issue\n2\n.\nFollowing completion of the Tender Offer, and given Somerston's irrevocable undertaking to accept\nthe Tender Offer in full (subject to scale back) for the Ordinary Shares Option, the Company anticipates\nthat there will be 1,562,506 ZDP Shares\n2\nin issue. This will represent a very small proportion of the Company's overall capital base.\nThe\nExisting\nArticles\nset\nout\ncertain\nprotections\nfor\nZDP\nShareholders\nafforded\nby\nundertakings\nby\nthe\nCompany not to, without the prior sanction of ZDP Shareholders, take certain actions. These\nrestrictions were established when the ZDP Shares were first issued and apply regardless of how many\nremain outstanding. The Board believes that, following completion of the Tender Offer, it would no longer be appropriate for the Company to be restricted by these provisions given the relatively low number of ZDP Shares that would remain in issue and the associated materially reduced potential\nliability associated with the Final Capital Entitlement. Accordingly, the ZDP Amendments would remove\nsome, but not all, of these protections as set out in paragraph 4.2 below.\nThe present Proposals are consistent with the view expressed by the Board in June 2025 that the\nCompany\nwill\nbenefit\nfrom\na\nsimpler\ncapital\nstructure\nwith\na\ndecreased\nemphasis\non\nthe\nZDP\nShares.\nThe Ordinary Shares Option is being made available to ZDP Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and certain Overseas Shareholders as explained in paragraph 11 of Part 2 of this document) to allow those ZDP Shareholders who wish to do so to exchange their holding of ZDP Shares for new Ordinary Shares at the Tender Price.\nThe\nBoard\nbelieves\nthat\nthe\nProposals\nare\nin\nthe\nbest\ninterests\nof\nthe\nOrdinary\nShareholders\nand\nafford\nZDP Shareholders an opportunity to exit their investment in full.\nZDP Shareholders who wish to continue to hold ZDP Shares, as amended, may do so. As noted in paragraph A.1 of Part 5 of this document, UK resident ZDP Shareholders should generally not be treated as making a disposal for the purposes of UK taxation of chargeable gains as a result of the ZDP Amendments. It is important to note that the discussion of the tax treatment contained in Part 5 of this document is intended only as a general and non-exhaustive summary of the expected tax treatment and ZDP Shareholders are advised to seek independent professional advice as to the tax consequences for them of the Proposals.\nNothing in this document constitutes or should be construed or relied upon as legal or tax advice.\n4.2\nKey Features of the amended ZDP\nShares\nIf\nthe\nZDP\nAmendments\nare\nadopted,\nthe\nZDP\nShares:\n\u25cf\nwill continue to have a repayment date of 5 December 2030 at a redemption price of 209.90 pence, subject to the Company having sufficient assets at the time to satisfy the solvency test set out under Guernsey company law;\n\u25cf\nwill\ncontinue\nto\nsee\nno\nfurther\ncapital\ngrowth;\n\u25cf\nwill continue to have the protections afforded by undertakings by the Company not to, without the prior sanction of ZDP Shareholders:\n\u274d\npass\na\nresolution\nreleasing\nthe\nDirectors\nfrom\ntheir\nobligation\nto\nredeem\nthe\nZDP\nShares\non\nthe ZDP Maturity Date;\n\u274d\npass\na\nresolution\nfor\nthe\nvoluntary\nwinding\nup\nor\nliquidation\nof\nthe\nCompany,\nsuch\nwinding\nup to take effect prior to the ZDP Maturity Date; or\n\u274d\npass\nany\nresolution\nto\nvary,\nmodify\nor\nabrogate\nany\nof\nthe\nspecial\nrights\nattached\nto\nthe\nZDP\nShares; and\n\u25cf\nwill\ncease\nto have the protections afforded by undertakings by the Company not to, without the prior sanction of ZDP Shareholders:\n\u274d\npay\ndividends\nto\nholders\nof\nOrdinary\nShares\nin\nexcess\nof\nan\namount\nset\nout\nin\nthe\nExisting Articles;\n\u274d\nissue further shares or securities, or rights to subscribe for or to convert or exchange any\nsecurities\ninto\nshares\nor\nsecurities\nor\nreclassify\nissued\nshare\ncapital\ninto\nshares\nor\nsecurities of a particular class where such shares or securities would on issue, conversion, exchange\nor\nreclassification\nrank\nas\nto\ncapital\nin\npriority\nto\nor\npari\npassu\nwith\nthe\nZDP\nShares,\nsubject\nto a Cover Test;\n2\nExcluding\ntreasury\nshares.\n\u274d\npass\na\nresolution\nto\nreduce\nthe\ncapital\nof\nthe\nCompany,\nsubject\nto\na\nCover\nTest;\n\u274d\nincur any borrowings in excess of \u00a330 million (subject to certain exclusions) or guarantee the indebtedness of any of its subsidiaries;\n\u274d\nmake\nany\nmaterial\nchange\nto\nthe\naccounting\npolicies\nadopted\nby\nthe\nCompany;\nor\n\u274d\nmake a material change to the business of the Company as a whole, which at the time of making such change, appears likely in the reasonable opinion of the Directors to be materially prejudicial to the holders of the ZDP Shares.\nThe foregoing list is a summary of the protections attaching to the ZDP Shares that are proposed to\nbe removed pursuant to the ZDP Amendments. The full text of these provisions is set out in the Existing\nArticles and also (in the form of a comparison document showing the changes between the two) the New Articles, both of which are available for inspection as set out in Part 6 of this document.\nSave\nas\nset\nout\nabove,\nthe\nrights\nof\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nfollowing\nthe\nimplementation\nof\nthe\nProposals\nwill\nbe\nthe\nsame\nas\nthe\nrights\nof\nthe\nexisting\nZDP\nShares.\nThe\namended\nrights\nof\nthe\nZDP\nShares\nare\nset\nout in the New Articles and are described in full in Part 3 of this document.\nThe ability of the Company to pay the Final Capital Entitlement is dependent on the\nperformance\nof\nthe\nCompany's\nbusiness\nand\ninvestments.\nZDP\nShares\nare\nnot\na\nguaranteed,\nprotected or secured investment and ZDP Shareholders may therefore not receive their full Final Capital Entitlement.\n4.3\nAdoption of the New\nArticles\nThe\nZDP\nAmendments\nwill\nbe\nimplemented\nby\nway\nof\nthe\nadoption\nof\nthe\nNew\nArticles.\nThe New Articles contain the amended rights attaching to the ZDP Shares as set out in Part 3 of this document.

In addition, Shareholders were invited to approve the ZDP Amendments, which included the adoption of the New Articles to remove certain restrictions on the Company as detailed in the Circular.

The proposals, which are more fully described in a circular to ZDP Shareholders and Ordinary Shareholders to be published later today (the \"\nCircular\n\"), are subject to approval at shareholder meetings to be held at the Company's registered office, Suite 1, First Floor, Windsor House, Lower Pollet, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WF, Channel Islands on 19 December 2025, commencing respectively at 10.00 a.m. and 10.05 a.m.\nProposed enhancement to Capital Structure\nThe Company is proposing to launch a tender offer to acquire up to 1,700,000 ZDP Shares, representing approximately 52 per cent. of the issued ZDP Shares (excluding ZDP Shares held in treasury), at a tender price of 120.00 pence per ZDP Share (the \"\nTender Offer\n\"). ZDP Shareholders (other than Restricted Shareholders and certain Overseas Shareholders) may elect to receive the Tender Price either in cash (the \"\nCash Option\n\") or in new Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company (the \"\nOrdinary Shares Option\n\"), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Circular.\u200b\nConcurrently with the Tender Offer, the Company is proposing amendments to the terms of the ZDP Shares (the \"\nZDP Amendments\n\") by way of the adoption of new articles of incorporation (the \"\nNew Articles\n\"), which will remove certain historic restrictions on the Company while preserving the existing ZDP maturity date of 5 December 2030 and the final capital entitlement of 209.90 pence per ZDP Share (the \"\nFinal Capital Entitlement\n\"). Following implementation of the Tender Offer and ZDP Amendments, the Board expects the Group to benefit from a simpler capital structure with a reduced Final Capital Entitlement and increased operational and financing flexibility.\u200b\nThe Circular (including the Notice of the ZDP Class Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting), Tender Form and Forms of Proxy will be posted to Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders later today and will also be available\u00a0on the Company's website at:\nhttps://corporate.sancus.com/investor-relations/\n.\nTrading Update\nSince the Company's results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025, the Company has continued to trade in line with the Board's expectations.\nIn the ten months to 31 October 2025 the Group generated revenues of \u00a316.7 million versus \u00a313.4 million in the ten months to 31 October 2024. In the ten months to 31 October 2025, the Group wrote \u00a3146.7 million of new loan facilities versus \u00a375.6 million in the ten months to 31 October 2024. As at 31 October, loans under management were \u00a3301 million (31 October 2024: \u00a3209.7 million). The Company continues to experience stable credit quality. Notwithstanding that the Group's UK and Channel Islands business continue to operate in an uncertain market environment the Board is confident of achieving further growth in its loan volumes and revenues for the remainder of 2025 as it continues to work towards achieving long term operating profitability.\nDetails of the Tender Offer\nUnder the Tender Offer, each eligible ZDP Shareholder whose name appears on the register at 6.00 p.m. on 17 December 2025 (the \"\nRecord Date\n\") will be entitled to tender up to 100 per cent. of their ZDP Shareholding at the Tender Price (their \"\nTender Entitlement\n\"). ZDP Shareholders who successfully tender ZDP Shares will receive the Tender Price per ZDP Share either in cash under the Cash Option or via the issue of new Ordinary Shares ",

In the first half of the year our residential lending businesses in the UK and Ireland, along with our Channel Islands property lending joint venture, have all made further progress in strengthening their market positions and operating platforms. This allowed us to achieve a 9% increase in Assets Under Management (\"AUM\") to \u00a3258.8m (31 December 2024: \u00a3237.6m; 30 June 2024: \u00a3209m) and deliver Group revenue of \u00a39.7m, a 29% increase on revenue of \u00a37.5m in H1 2024. We have reported a profit before tax of \u00a30.1m compared to a loss before tax of \u00a3(0.6m) in H1 2024, supported by a gain of \u00a31.0m from the buy-back of ZDP shares. We know that we need to deliver sustained operating profitability. Our recently strengthened teams, new business pipeline and enhanced funding diversity gives me confidence that we are on track to achieve this ambition.\"\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nGroup revenue increased 29% to \u00a39.7m (H1 2024: \u00a37.5m).\n\u00b7\nProfit before tax of \u00a30.1m compared to a loss before tax of \u00a3(0.6m) in H1 2024.\n\u00b7\nNew loan facilities written increased 64% to \u00a384.4m (H1 2024: \u00a351.3m).\n\u00b7\nAUM increased 9% to \u00a3258.8m as at 30 June 2025 from \u00a3237.6m as at 31 December 2024 (30 June 2024: \u00a3209m).\nSTRATEGIC AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nAchievement of \u00a30.1m profit before tax, reflecting improved operating performance and also supported by \u00a31.0m of gains from the buy-back of \u00a31.4m of ZDP shares in H1 2025.\n\u00b7\nGood progress in strengthening operating platforms, including further deepening of UK and Irish teams.\no\nUK AUM increased 14% to \u00a395.6m (31 December 2024: \u00a384.0m; 30 June 2024: \u00a375.8m) with the business writing new facilities of \u00a334.4m (H1 2024: \u00a327.8m).\no\nIrish AUM increased 29% to \u00a361.7m (31 December 2024: \u00a347.8m; 30 June 2024: \u00a339.2m) with the business writing new facilities of \u00a325.4m (H1 2024: \u00a314.7m).\no\nChannel Islands AUM decreased slightly to \u00a3101.6m (31 December 2024: \u00a3105.8m; 30 June 2024: \u00a393.9m) reflecting positive momentum in winding down the legacy Sancus Jersey loan book, with the business also writing \u00a324.6m of new facilities within the joint venture with Hawk (\"JV\")(H1 2024: \u00a38.8m).\n\u00b7\nFurther diversification and strengthening of the Group's funding sources:\no\nAgreement of revised terms for the Company's funding facility with Pollen Street Capital with the facility being increased to \u00a3200m and extended to June 2030.

The Company also announces that it has entered into an additional funding facility to support the planned growth in its property backed lending book.\nTrading Update\nIn the Period, the Group's revenue increased by 29 per cent. to \u00a39.7 million (2024: \u00a37.5 million).\u00a0During the Period, the Company wrote new loan facilities of \u00a378.6 million, an increase of 54 per cent. (2024: \u00a351.0 million). These increases reflect increased activity levels across the Group with the UK and Irish businesses, in particular, delivering growth. As at 30 June 2025, the Group's assets under management of \u00a3259 million had increased by 9 per cent. (31 December 2024: \u00a3238 million).\nOverall, the Company currently estimates that it will report a profit before tax of approximately \u00a30.1 million\u00a0for the Period (2024: loss before tax of \u00a30.6 million). This improved operating result reflects the benefits of the organic growth delivered in the Period, disciplined credit management and stable credit quality and a gain arising from the repurchase of a portion of the Group's ZDP shares during the Period.\nMarket Context\nThe UK & Channel Island property market continues to operate under challenging conditions as interest rates remain stubbornly high, which has placed pressure on borrower affordability and dampened activity levels in our core residential property lending segment.\nIn contrast, the Irish market is benefitting from a more supportive macroeconomic environment, with lower base rates and resilient demand for property-backed finance. The performance of the Irish business provides the Group with valuable geographic diversification, helping to offset the impact of more difficult trading conditions in the UK and Channel Islands.\nOutlook\nThe Group remains focused on achieving sustainable run-rate profitability and has entered the second half of the year with an encouraging new business pipeline. The recently secured complementary funding facility positions the Group well to capitalise on selective growth opportunities across its core markets.\nThe Company expects to announce its unaudited interim results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025 in early September 2025.\nNew \u00a320 million Paragon Bank Facility\nThe Group\u00a0is pleased to\u00a0announce\u00a0that\u00a0it has entered into agreements with Paragon Bank plc for the provision of a \u00a320 million committed funding facility (the \"\nParagon Facility\n\"). The Paragon Facility, which has a 3 year term, will\u00a0increase the Group's capacity to grow its property backed lending book in England, Wales and Scotland.\nThe junior capital required for the Paragon Facility will be provided under the Somerston Junior Funding Commitment of up to\u00a0\u00a310 million, details of which were announced by the Company on\u00a030 January 2025. In the short-term, the Group expects to draw up to \u00a32.5 million under the Somerston Junior Funding Commitment to finance the junior capital requirements of the Paragon Facility, leaving \u00a33.1 million undrawn.\nThis new facility complements the Group's recently extended and upsized senior secured facility with Pollen Street Capital, which was increased from \u00a3125 million up to \u00a3200 million and extended to June 2030. Together, these funding arrangements significantly strengthen the Group's lending capacity and provide a diversified platform to support future growth across its core markets.\nCapitalised terms not defined in this announcement have the meanings given to them in the Company's announcement of\u00a030 January 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn\u00a0(Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nInstinctif Partners\u00a0(PR Adviser)\nHannah Scott\nGalyna Kulachek\n+44 (0)20 7457 2020\nApex Fund and Corporate Services (Guernsey) Limited\nNikita Pingale\nAoife Bennett\n+44 (0)20 3530 3696\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TENDER OFFER (AS DEFINED HEREIN) IN OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION IN OR FROM WHICH, OR TO OR FROM ANY PERSON TO OR FROM WHOM, IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE SUCH OFFER UNDER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OR OTHERWISE.\n4 June 2025\nSancus Lending Group Limited\n(\"Sancus\" the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nProposed amendments to ZDP Shares & Bonds\nTender Offer for ZDP Shares\nIssue of New Bonds\nRelated Party Transactions\nand\nUpdate on Current Trading\nSancus Lending Group Limited (AIM: LEND) provides an update on its current trading and announces\na series of inter-conditional proposals designed to simplify the Company's capital structure, enhance financial flexibility, and support its strategic plan for growth and profitability. These proposals, which are subject to approval at shareholder meetings scheduled for 24 June 2025, include amendments to the Company's Zero Dividend Preference Shares (\"\nZDPs\n\"), a Tender Offer to acquire certain ZDPs, and related amendments to the Company's Bonds.\nProposed enhancement to Capital Structure\nThe Company is proposing to amend the terms of the ZDPs by extending their maturity date from 5 December 2027 to 5 December 2030 and suspend the accrual of further capital growth in the ZDPs from the date of shareholder approval, expected to be 24 June 2025. Under the amended terms, the final capital entitlement of the ZDPs would be fixed at 209.90 pence per share, payable in 2030, subject to the Company meeting the statutory solvency test under Guernsey law at that time. These amendments are intended to reduce the Company's future financial obligations and enable better deployment of cash resources in the medium term.\nConcurrently, the Company is launching a Tender Offer to acquire up to 1,257,937 ZDPs, representing 100% of the issued ZDPs not held by Somerston Group Limited (\"\nSomerston\n\"), the Company's majority shareholder. The Tender Price of 120.00 pence per ZDP share, represents a premium of approximately 11% to the price at which ZDPs were bought by the Company in December 2024 in connection with the delisting of the ZDPs and a discount of approximately 43% to the theoretical 2030 Final Capital Entitlement. The Tender Offer provides liquidity to ZDP Shareholders who wish to exit their investment early, while also reducing the Company's outstanding capital obligations. The Tender Offer is expected to complete on or around 24 June 2025 and will be funded through a conditional subscription by Somerston Fintech for new unsecured bonds equivalent to the maximum amount to be tendered, further details of which are set out below. Philip J Milton, which owns 16.3% of the Company's ordinary shares and 22.1% of the ZDPs, has irrevocably undertaken to tender all of the ZDPs held by it in the Tender Offer.\nTo fund the Tender Offer, the Company proposes a conditional bond issue, whereby Somerston Fintech will subscribe for New Bonds equivalent to the value of ZDPs validly tendered. The New Bonds will be issued on the same terms as existing bonds due on 31 December 2027, but will include a new payment-in-kind (\"\nPIK\n\") interest option allowing interest to accrue and be paid on maturity at an enhanced rate of 8.5% per annum. Additionally, the Company is seeking written approval from existing Bondholders to adopt this optional PIK feature across all Bonds, with Somerston Fintech (holding over 80% of bonds) having committed to vote in favour.\nA circular (including the Notice of Class Meetings, Notice of EGM, Tender Form and Forms of Proxy) (the \"\nZDP Circular\n\") will be posted to Ordinary Shareholders and ZDP Shareholders later today and will also be available\u00a0on the Company's website at:\nwww.sancus.com\n.\nA circular (including the Bondholder Resolution) (the \"\nBond Circular\n\" and together with the ZDP Circular, the \"\nCirculars\n\") will be posted to Bondholders\nlater today\nand will also be available\u00a0on the Company's website at:\nwww.sancus.com\n.\nNotices of the ZDP Class Meeting, the Ordinary Class Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company to be held at the Company's registered office, Suite 1, First Floor, Windsor House, Lower Pollet, St. ",

Our residential property lending businesses are now operating efficiently in the UK & Ireland, as is our joint venture for property lending in the Channel Islands.\nWe expect to be profitable in each of these markets in the coming year and look forward to ongoing investment in their growth. Amberton, our private wealth & asset management joint venture established in 2021 to manage our Loan Notes, has successfully grown its programme during 2024 and we expect to maintain this growth as we continue to\naccess private wealth clients and aim to provide them with attractive risk adjusted returns.\nDuring the year, we achieved a \u00a335.5 million (18%) increase in Assets Under Management (\"AUM\") to \u00a3237.6m (2023: \u00a3202.1m). This helped us deliver\na 36% growth in Group revenue to \u00a316.8m (2023: \u00a312.3m) and reduce our operating loss to \u00a32.3m in 2024, from \u00a39.8m in 2023. We reported a profit before tax of \u00a30.1m, also helped by other net gains of \u00a32.7m (2023: \u00a30.0m), primarily reflecting the gains on the buy-back of ZDP Shares. While we have much work to do in order to deliver sustained operating profitability, these results and the benefits of actions taken in the year to improve the positioning of our core business gives me confidence that we now have the platform from which to deliver profitable growth and accelerate our strategic progress.\"\nFinancial Highlights\n\u2022\nGroup revenue increased by 36% to \u00a316.8m (2023: \u00a312.3m).\n\u2022\nAn Expected Credit Loss (\"ECL\") credit of \u00a30.4m compared to \u00a34.8m charge in 2023, reflecting a stabilisation in the credit quality of the Group's on balance sheet loan portfolio and continued progress in managing legacy loan exposures.\n\u2022\nGroup Profit Before Tax (\"PBT\") for the year of \u00a30.1m (2023: Loss Before Tax \u00a39.0m) including gains of \u00a32.8m on the buy-back of some Zero Dividend Preference Shares (\"ZDP Shares\")\nOperational Highlights\n\u2022\nLoan book at year end of \u00a3237.6m, an 18% increase in the year (2023: \u00a3202.1m).\n\u2022\nUK AUM increased by 33% to \u00a384.0m (2023: \u00a363.0m), with the business writing \u00a348.3m of new facilities vs \u00a337.0m in 2023.\n\u2022\nIrish loan book grew by 45% to \u00a347.8m (2023: \u00a332.9m) with the business writing new facilities of \u00a339.9m (2023: \u00a346.1m).\n\u2022\nChannel Islands Hawk joint-venture, which commenced in January 2024, wrote new facilities of \u00a320.1m in very challenging market conditions. At the year-end it had AUM of \u00a3105.8m, including \u00a383.1m relating to the legacy Sancus Jersey and Hawk businesses (2023: \u00a3106.2m).\n\u2022\nAmberton joint venture increased its loan note programme to AUM of \u00a341.7 million (2023: \u00a326.9m).\nStrategic Highlights\n\u00b7\nAchievement of \u00a30.1m PBT, reflecting improved operating performance especially in the latter part of 2024 also supported by \u00a32.8m of gains from the buy-back of ZDP Shares.\n\u00b7\nGood progress in our UK and Irish property lending businesses, specifically:\no\nStrengthening of the UK business, including enhanced leadership team and the opening of a Manchester office to allow us to accelerate the growth of the UK business.\no\nContinued expansion and strong profitability within the Irish business.\no\nLaunch of Channel Island joint venture with Hawk Lending Limited, giving us a continued interest in the Channel Islands property financing market (Sancus Jersey is in run-off) and enhanced access to private wealth relationships.\no\nContinued growth of private wealth and asset management joint venture, Amberton, helped support the Group's diversification of funding, including through the launch of Loan Note 9.\no\nIssuance of our first Euro loan note (\u20ac1.1m).\n\u00b7\nFurther strengthening of the Group's capital position and flexibility:\no\nExtension of the maturity date of the Corporate Bond to October 2027 from December 2025.\no\nRepurchase of \u00a33.5m of ZDP Shares, resulting in a gain on purchase of c. \u00a32.8m. The ZDP Shares were delisted in December 2024.\no\nSomerston, the Group's largest shareholder, subscribed for \u00a35m of preference shares in Sancus Loans Limited, one of our subsidiaries, in April 2024.\nCurrent Trading and post balance sheet events\n\u00b7\nIn the first two months of 2025 we generated revenues of \u00a33.0m, a 20% increase on revenues generated in the equivalent 2024 period (2024: \u00a32.5m).\n\u00b7\nNew Facilities written in the first two months were \u00a324.3m. Although this is slightly lower than the equivalent 2024 period (2024: \u00a327.7m) the business has a stronger pipeline than it did at this stage in 2024.\n\u00b7\nAUM as at 28 February 2025 were \u00a3247.9m, a 4% increase on AUM as at 31 December 2024 of \u00a3237.6m.\n\u00b7\nThese factors give management confidence that the business is capable of delivering run-rate profitability in 2025.\n\u00b7\nIn",

The person responsible for making this announcement on behalf of the Company is Rory Mepham.\n30 January 2025\nSancus Lending Group Limited (the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update and Junior Funding Commitment\nThe Board of the Company today provides an update on the Group's unaudited results for the year ended 31 December 2024 and announces that its majority shareholder, Somerston, has entered into a commitment to provide it with up to \u00a310m of junior funding to support loan financing facilities that the Company has and/or anticipates entering into.\nTrading Update\nAt the year-end the Group had loans under management of \u00a3238m, an increase of 18% on the prior year (31 December 2023: \u00a3202m), reflecting growth in our UK and Irish businesses. During 2024 the Company wrote new facilities of \u00a3114m, a 12% increase on the prior year (2023: \u00a3102m).\nDuring the year the Group increased its turnover by 36% to c. \u00a316.8m (2023: \u00a312.3m). Overall, the Company currently estimates that, after considering the effect of a gain of c. \u00a32.8m from the repurchase of some if its Zero Dividend Preference Shares, it will report an at or around break even result for the year ended 31 December 2024, substantially better than the loss of \u00a39.0m it reported in 2023. The Board is encouraged by the strategic and operating actions management is taking. The business remains committed to returning the Group to profitability and is targeting achieving run-rate profitability in 2025.\nJunior Funding Commitment\nOne of these strategic actions includes ensuring that the Group maintains sufficient financial strength and liquidity in order that it can execute its growth strategy, including financing further loan portfolios. The Group, via its wholly owned subsidiary, Sancus Loans Limited (\"\nSancus Loans\n\"), has access to a loan facility of up to \u00a3125 million (subject to certain criteria), provided by funds managed by Pollen Street Capital (the \"\nPollen Street Facility\n\"), maturing in November 2026, and which is currently \u00a3105m drawn. In addition, the Group is also making good progress in finalising other financing facilities for its UK and Irish businesses, including with another leading UK challenger bank.\nAll of these facilities, including further drawings under the Pollen Street Facility, require junior funding to support the senior funds advanced by the relevant counterparty. The Group is pleased to announce that Somerston Fintech Limited (\"\nSomerston Fintech\n\"), a subsidiary of Somerston Group, the majority shareholder of the Company, has committed to subscribe for up to \u00a310m of junior funding (the \"\nSomerston Junior Commitment\n\") in the existing or future loan financing facilities of the Group, subject to standard conditions precedent. It is anticipated that, when utilised, the Somerston Junior Commitment will be effected by Somerston Fintech subscribing for preference shares in, or extending subordinated loans to, the relevant financing entity. In addition, the Somerston Junior Commitment can also be used to subscribe for 8% Sancus Bonds to enable the Group to provide junior funding to a financing facility of the Group. Where the Somerston Junior Commitment is used to subscribe for preference shares, these will carry the same 15% non-cash, cumulative coupon as the preference shares that Somerston Fintech currently has in Sancus Loans Limited, one of the Group's subsidiaries, which were issued in April 2024 and mature in November 2026. Where the Somerston Junior Commitment is used to subscribe for subordinated loans to a financing entity, these will have a non-cash cumulative coupon of 9.75% over the Bank of England base rate and an additional variable fee such that the target IRR of the subordinated loan issued is c. 17%, payable at the maturity of the relevant facility.\nRelated party transaction\nSomerston Fintech is a related party to the Company in accordance with the AIM Rules, by virtue of Somerston Fintech's substantial shareholding in the Company. Accordingly, the Somerston Junior Commitment constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. The independent directors (being the Company's directors with the exception of Tracy Clarke) consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Panmure Liberum Limited, that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as its shareholders are concerned.\nNotice of Annual Results\nThe Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2024 in March 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory MephamKeith Lawrence+44 (0)1481 708 280\nPanmure Liberum Limited",

No ZDP Shares were acquired by Somerston.\nFollowing the above transaction, the Company has 16,314,551 ZDP Shares in issue, of which 11,894,628 ZDP Shares are held by the Company as treasury shares. The total number of ZDP Share voting rights is therefore 4,419,923.\nThis figure of 4,419,923 may be used by holders of ZDP Shares as the denominator for the calculations by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the ZDP Shares under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nIssue of Bonds\nAs announced on 13 November 2024, the ZDP Share Buyback was funded by the issue by the Company to Somerston of 8 per cent. unsecured Bonds. Pursuant to a conditional subscription from Somerston, subject to completion of the ZDP Share Buyback, Bonds have been issued to Somerston in an aggregate principal amount of \u00a32,003,303.\nCancellation of Listing of ZDP Shares\nFollowing its announcement on 13 November 2024, the Company confirms that the Cancellation of the ZDP Shares is expected to become effective at 7.00 a.m. on 11 December 2024. Applications have been made to the FCA and the LSE to effect a Cancellation of the ZDP Shares in the non-equity shares and non-voting equity shares category of the Official List and to trading on the Main Market.\nFollowing the Cancellation, in respect of the ZDP Shares, the Company will no longer be subject to the regulatory and statutory regime which applies to companies admitted to listing in the non-equity shares and non-voting equity shares category of the Official List and traded on the Main Market.\nThe Cancellation will not apply to the Company's Ordinary Shares, which will continue to be admitted to trading on the AIM market of the LSE.\nTransactions in the ZDP Shares post the Cancellation\nZDP Shareholders should note that they are able to continue to trade in the ZDP Shares on the Main Market following the ZDP Share Buyback and prior to the effective date of Cancellation.\nThe Company wishes to remind holders of its ZDP Shares that, if a ZDP Shareholder retains their ZDP Shares following the Cancellation, although the ZDP Shares will remain freely tradeable, they will no longer be tradeable on the Main Market and no other formal facility (such as CREST) will be available to facilitate the trading of the ZDP Shares.\nAll ZDP Shareholders should note that following Cancellation the ability for ZDP Shareholders to dispose of their ZDP Shares will be significantly diminished and will be dependent on there being a willing buyer for those ZDP Shares at such time.\nThose ZDP Shareholders who hold their ZDP Shares in CREST will be sent share certificates for their holding by 31 December 2024.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall have the same meanings as set out in the Company's announcement on 13 November 2024 '\nCancellation of ZDP Share Listing and Buyback\n'.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham\nKeith Lawrence\n+44 (0)1481 708 280\nPanmure Liberum Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker)\nChris Clarke\nWilliam King\n+44 (0) 20 3100 2000\nInstinctif Partners\u00a0(PR Advisor)\nHannah Scott\nAugustine Chipungu\n+44 (0)20 7457 2020\nApex Group Ltd\nMatt Falla\nNicola Momberg\n+44 (0)1481 755530\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The 39% increase in revenue reflects our success in driving increased fee income. Our Assets Under Management increased to \u00a3209m versus \u00a3202m as at 31 December 2023 and we continue to strive to move from loss to profitability.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u2022\nNew loan facilities written in H1 2024 of \u00a351m (H1 2023: \u00a357m).\n\u2022\nGroup revenue H1 2024 of \u00a37.5m (H1 2023: \u00a35.4m).\n\u2022\nA reduction in IFRS 9 provisions in H1 2024 of \u00a30.5m (H1 2023: increase of \u00a30.8m).\n\u2022\nReduction in Group Borrowing Costs to \u00a31.2m (H1 2023: \u00a31.7m) and a gain on repurchase of ZDPs of c. \u00a31.1m (H1 2023: \u00a3nil).\n\u2022\nGroup operating loss H1 2024 of \u00a31.5m (H1 2023: loss \u00a33.3m).\n\u2022\nNet loss after tax H1 2024 of \u00a30.6m (H1 2023: loss \u00a33.3m).\nStrategic and Operating Highlights\n\u2022\nJoint venture with Hawk Lending Limited launched.

Whilst the Group reported a loss of \u00a3(0.6)m for H1 2024, the loss is materially improved from the loss of \u00a3(3.3)m in H1 2023 and has also been helped by the exceptional gain of c. \u00a31.1m on the ZDP shares. The Company remained disciplined in the volume of new loans written in H1 2024 and enters H2 2024 cautiously optimistic about its new business opportunities. The joint venture we announced with Hawk Lending Limited in December 2023 became operational in H1 2024 and the business has now started writing new business. The management team is taking all necessary steps to ensure it becomes a profitable contributor to the Group.\nOur People\nAs detailed in the 2023 Annual Report, Keith Lawrence was appointed as our new Group Chief Financial Officer in March 2024, succeeding Tracy Clarke who had acted as Interim Chief Financial Officer since March 2023. Tracy has now resumed her role as a non-executive director of the Group.\nCapital\nIn April 2024 Somerston, the Group's largest shareholder, subscribed for \u00a35m of preference shares in Sancus Loans Limited, one of our core subsidiaries. Also in April, the Group repurchased 1.4m of its ZDP shares at a cost of \u00a31.5m, resulting in an accounting gain of c. \u00a31.1m.\nDividend and Shareholders\nIt is the Board's intention to reinvest surplus resources for growth. As such, the Group does not intend to declare a dividend for the period. The dividend policy will be revisited at the appropriate time, should the profitability and cash flow profile support the reinstatement of a dividend.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their continuing support and patience and for the efforts of the management and employees.\nAs I noted in the Chairman's statement in the 2023 annual report, we remain cautious about the continuing challenges ahead. I firmly believe that we have the right strategy, systems and personnel to put the business onto a stronger footing and return to profitability and I look forward to reporting more positive developments in the coming period.\nSteve Smith\nChairman\n16 September 2024\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW\nOverview\nIn the first half of 2024 we continued to navigate the negative impacts of a sustained period of higher interest rates on the housing market. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on the steps re",

The person responsible for making this announcement on behalf of the Company is Rory Mepham.\nSancus Lending Group Limited\n(\"Sancus\", the \"Company\" or \"Group\")\nFinal Results for the year ended 31 December 202\n3\n28 June 2024\nHIGHLIGHTS\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer of Sancus Lending Group Limited, commented:\n\"\nWe remain committed to returning Sancus to profitable growth. During the year we have continued to focus on getting our operating platform functioning efficiently in our three core markets, the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands. Our strategic focus is clear - to become a private credit and property focussed asset and wealth manager - in which management, our shareholders and funders have specific sectorial expertise and deal flow.\nWhile we focus on credit quality and are on track to deliver our renewed strategies our reported operating loss of \u00a39.9m, includes an Expected Credit Loss (\"ECL\") charge of \u00a34.8 million predominantly against legacy loans written in 2019 or before. The carrying cost of these historic loans and an increased group borrowing cost accounted for the majority of the remainder of the loss.\nDuring the year our residential property credit business achieved a 23% increase in pro-forma loans under management to \u00a3208m, including the impact of a joint venture we announced with Hawk Lending Limited in December 2023. This joint venture, in addition to strengthening our Channel Islands lending position will also improve our access to family office wealth. We also saw good growth in the Irish business.\nThe Sancus team remain committed to achieving the highest possible proceeds from the \"workout\" of legacy loans and we anticipate completing the majority of these workouts in 2024. We have had an encouraging start to the year. In the 5 months to May 2024 we generated revenues of \u00a36.3m\u00a0(including our share of the joint venture announced with Hawk Lending Limited). This compares to \u00a34.6m for the 5 months to 31 May 2023. Our pro-forma Assets Under Management (\"AUM\") Is now \u00a3216m, a 7% increase on the equivalent year-end position (\u00a3202m) and we have an encouraging business pipeline. Although we expect to report an operating loss for the 6 months to 30 June 2024 we expect this will be substantially lower than the \u00a33.8m operating loss for the 6 months to 30 June 2023. While the immediate economic outlook for the residential property market remains somewhat uncertain we are excited by the potential of the teams that we have assembled in the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands. We believe that these teams now have the platform from which to deliver profitable growth and accelerate our strategic progress.\"\nFinancial Highlights\n\u2022\nGroup revenue increased by 23% to \u00a312.3m (2022: \u00a310.0m)\n\u2022\nOperating losses of \u00a39.9m (2022: loss \u00a34.7m)\n\u2022\nAn ECL charge of \u00a34.8m compared to \u00a30.4m charge in 2022, reflecting required provisions against loans written by the previous management team\n\u2022\nGroup PBT loss for the year of \u00a39.1m (2022: loss \u00a314.1m)\nOperational Highlights\n\u2022\nPro-forma loan book at year end \u00a3202m (2022: \u00a3169m), reflecting the impact of the Hawk Lending Limited joint venture\n\u2022\nGeographic focus remains unchanged: Irish loan book grew by 67% to \u00a332.9m (2022: \u00a319.7m), UK loan book largely flat at \u00a363.0m (2022: \u00a365.9m) with Channel Islands benefitting from impact of Hawk Lending Limited joint venture (pro-forma loan book of \u00a3103.1m vs \u00a370.5m in 2022)\n\u2022\nNew facilities written lower at \u00a3102m (2022: \u00a3122m), primarily reflecting the UK property market (2023 loans written: \u00a337m vs 2022: \u00a384m). Irish loans written up 153% at \u00a346m\nStrategic Highlights\n\u2022\nCompletion of a joint venture with Hawk Lending Limited to form a new Jersey based private credit and debt advisory business. The joint venture also significantly enhances the Group's Channel Islands network of private wealth relationships.\n\u2022\nFurther strengthening of the Group's capital flexibility:\no\nSomerston purchased \u00a33m of ZDP bonds held in treasury in April 2023\no\nSomerston also subscribed for \u00a35m of preference shares in Sancus Lending (UK) Limited, one of our subsidiaries, in April 2024\n\u2022\nThe Group completed its withdrawal from Guernsey and Gibraltar in early 2023. As part of our withdrawal from\nGuernsey finance and treasury functions were provided by Carlton Management Services until March 2024. This contract has now come to an end and relevant staff have now been employed by Sancus.\nCurrent Trading\n\u2022\nRevenues of \u00a36.3m\u00a0in the 5 months to 31 May 2024 (including our share of the Hawk Lending Limited joint venture) with all parts of the business reporting revenue growth. This compares to revenue of \u00a34.6m for the 5 months to 31 May 2023.\n\u2022\nPro-forma AUM of \u00a3216m vs ",

          "full_content": "24 Apr 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 7743L\nSancus Lending Group Limited\n24 April 2024\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as amended by The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. The person responsible for making this announcement on behalf of the Company is Rory Mepham.\n24 April 2024\nSancus Lending Group Limited\n(the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update and Capital Strengthening\nThe Board of the Company today provides an update on the Group's unaudited results for the year ended 31 December 2023 and announces a strengthening of the Group's capital position.\nAt the year-end the Group had pro-forma loans under management of \u00a3208m, an increase of 23% (31 December 2022: \u00a3169m). The increase reflects growth in our Irish loan book, which grew strongly from \u00a321m to \u00a332m as at 31 December 2023 and also the pro-forma impact of the joint venture we announced with Hawk Lending Limited in Jersey on 5 December 2023. As at 31 December 2023 the pro-forma Jersey loan book was \u00a3114m (31 December 2022: \u00a370.5m). The UK loan book was broadly flat at \u00a363m (31 December 2022: \u00a365.9m).\nDuring the year the Group increased its turnover by 24% to c. \u00a312.4m (31 December 2022: \u00a310.0m). This growth reflects progress in our UK and Irish businesses in particular. Overall, the Company now currently estimates that it will report an operating loss of between \u00a39.5m to \u00a310.0m for the year ended 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a3(4.7)m). This primarily reflects the estimated impact of anticipated IFRS9 write-downs on legacy loans written prior to the current senior management team joining the business. The Board remains committed to returning the Group to profitability and is confident in the strategic actions it is taking to achieve this.\nOne of these strategic actions includes ensuring that the Group maintains sufficient financial strength and liquidity in order that it can execute its strategy. Sancus Loans Limited (\"Sancus Loans\") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group that, as at 31 December 2023, funded \u00a377.75m of its loans and which is primarily financed by a financing facility provided by funds managed by Pollen Street Capital. The Group is pleased to announce that Somerston Fintech Limited (\"Somerston Fintech\"), a subsidiary of Somerston Group, the majority shareholder of the Company, has subscribed for \u00a35,000,000 of preference shares (the \"Preference Shares\") in Sancus Loans (the \"Subscription\"). The Preference Shares will be issued with a non-cash, cumulative coupon rate of 15% and a maturity date of 23 November 2026. The proceeds of the Subscription will be used to strengthen the liquidity of Sancus Loans. The Group also expects that approximately \u00a34m of these proceeds will be available for transfer from Sancus Loans to other Group subsidiaries in order to provide the Group with additional corporate flexibility and working capital.\nRelated party transaction\nSomerston Fintech is a related party to the Company in accordance with the AIM Rules, by virtue of Somerston Fintech's shareholding in the Company. Accordingly, the issue of the Preference Shares to Somerston Fintech constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. The independent directors (being the Company's directors with the exception of Tracy Clarke) consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Liberum Capital, that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as its independent shareholders are concerned.\nNotice of Annual Results\nThe Group will release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2023 in June 2024.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham\nKeith Lawrence\n+44 (0)1481 708 280\nLiberum Capital (Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker)\nChris Clarke\nWilliam King\n+44 (0) 20 3100 2000\nInstinctif Partners (PR Adviser)\nTim Linacre\nVivian Lai\n+44 (0)207 457 2020\nApex Group Ltd\nMatt Falla\nNicola Momberg\n+44 (0)1481 755530\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Funding for the Joint Venture's lending operations will be provided through a combination of funding sources including a \u00a330 million facility provided by the Morton Family, the respective existing co-funder networks, existing and new loan notes, and other institutional sources of funding, including the Sancus Group's \u00a3125 million facility with Pollen Street Capital (subject to relevant criteria).\nAll staff from Sancus Lending (Jersey) Limited and Hawk Group Limited are expected to ultimately be retained and employed by the Joint Venture.

However the uncertainty in residential real estate markets in the jurisdictions in which we operate, together with the impact of inflation and rising interest rates, has led to a slow down in loan origination in H1 2023 as we became more selective from both a credit and loan pricing perspective.\nThe refinance and extension of the ZDP share final entitlement to December 2027, and the increase and extension of the Pollen Street Plc facility up to \u00a3125m (expiry not before November 2026) at the end of 2022, provide the Company with a more stable base from which to grow when the right opportunities present themselves, in the meantime caution shall prevail.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nNew loan facilities written H1 2023 of \u00a383m (H1 2022: \u00a386m);\n\u00b7\nGroup revenue H1 2023 of \u00a35.4m (H1 2022: \u00a34.8m);\n\u00b7\nGroup operating loss H1 2023 of \u00a33.8m (H1 2022: loss \u00a32.1m);\n\u00b7\n\u00a33m of ZDP shares held in Treasury were sold to the Group's largest shareholder, Somerston, providing further growth capital;\n\u00b7\nAn increase in IFRS 9 provisions H1 2023 of \u00a30.8m (H1 2022: \u00a3nil).\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nThe Company completed its office rationalisation program in H1 2023, and now operates from three locations, Jersey; Dublin and London, to align with its core lending markets and optimise costs.\n\u00b7\nGeographic focus remains unchanged, with three core markets UK, Ireland and Offshore. Offshore represent 42% of the current loan book, UK 39% and Ireland 19%. Ireland is the fastest growing market with a 52% increase in loans under management in H1 2023.\n\u00b7\nThe Company continues to seek ways to reduce its operational costs. Headcount was further reduced during the period from 39 to 31 FTE.\n\u00b7\nSince onboarding Salesforce software at the end of 2022, significant progress has been made with implementation and use of technology to manage workflows, standardisation of process and controls across the lending life cycle and integration with the Company's propriety loan management system.\n\u00b7\nFocus on maintaining credit discipline has remained.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham\n+44 (0)1534 708 900\nLiberum Capital (Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker)\nLauren Kettle\nChris Clarke\nWilliam King\n+44 (0) 20 3100 2000\nInstinctif Partners (PR Adviser)\nTim Linacre\nVictoria Hayns\n+44 (0)207 457 2020\nSanne Fund Services (Guernsey) Limited\n(Company Secretary)\nMatt Falla\n+44 (0)1481 755530\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nIntroduction\nIn the last 12 months the Company has made advances in its structural change program, and whilst operational progress is not reflected in the results for the H1 2023, we expect to see benefits in H2 2023 and beyond. In H1 2023 the Company reported a loss of \u00a33.3m, and the loan book has remained flat since Dec 2022 at \u00a3169m, a reflection of robust credit discipline and a cautious approach to loan deployment, particularly in the UK. The cost of Funding has increased and we are now operating in the highest interest rate environment since 2008. Careful use of Group capital, and draw-down from our funding sources, is paramount to the successful navigation of a very tough market environment, but in spite of these exacting circumstances demand in our chosen markets remains firm and we believe may present opportunities for the Company to grow in the coming period.\nOur People\nAs noted in our FY22 results, we did not expect to increase headcount in 2023, and we took the opportunity to reduce Group headcount further to 31 as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: 39).\nAs detailed in the 2022 Annual Report, Tracy Clarke was appointed as Group CFO on 30 March 2023 and Carlton Management Services Limited was appointed to restructure the Group Finance Function. The migration of the Group Finance Function under Tracy's leadership was completed in Q2 2023.\nCapital Raise\nA significant milestone at the end of 2022 was the extension of the ZDP final entitlement date from 5 December 2022 to 5 December 2027. In addition, \u00a33m of ZDP shares held in Treasury were sold to Somerston, the Company's largest shareholder, in April 2023, providing the company with additional growth capital. I thank our ZDP shareholders for their continued support.\nDividend and Shareholders\nIt is the Board's intention to reinvest surplus resources for growth. As such, the Group does not intend to declare a dividend for the period.\u00a0The Board intends to revisit this policy at the appropriate time, should the profitability and cash flow profile support the reinstatement of a dividend.\nOn beha",

The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit.\nThe Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m).\nDuring the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m).\nThe Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning. During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs. The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m).\nAs a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability.\nThe Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0in\u00a0March 2026.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham, Chief Executive Officer\nKeith Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)1481 708280\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths\u00a0/\u00a0George Payne\u00a0(Corporate Advisory)\nOliver Jackson / Ansh Batura (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nRedwood Co Sec Limited\nCharlotte Sanders\nGwen Norman\n+44 (0)1481 701950\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "Sancus Lending Group Limited (\"Sancus\" the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") Trading Update Sancus Lending Group Limited (AIM: LEND) provides the following update on its results for the year ended 31 December 2025. The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit. The Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m). During the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m). The Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning.    During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs.  The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m). As a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability. The Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in March 2026. For further information, please contact:",

          "content": "Sancus Lending Group Limited (\"Sancus\" the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") Trading Update Sancus Lending Group Limited (AIM: LEND) provides the following update on its results for the year ended 31 December 2025. The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit. The Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m). During the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m). The Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning.    During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs.  The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m). As a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability. The Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in March 2026. For further information, please contact:",

As Sancus continues this growth trajectory into 2026, the market will re-rate the stock from a \"distressed\" play to a \"growth\" play . Currently, the stock is trading at a significant discount to its peer group's average Price-to-Sales and Book Value, because of the wide spread and low liquidity, price movement is often \"lumpy\"\u2014it stays flat for days and then will move 30% ii a few hours. Conservative Forecast: 2.50p \u2013 2.80p. This assumes the market digests the recent gains and waits for the audited results in March 2026. 5.00p+, assumes Sancus announces a major new funding partner or a further reduction in debt (ZDP repurchases) later this year.

By buying now, you are essentially paying a \"liquidity premium\" today to capture the significant upside potential before the rest of the market arrives. Strong Fundamental Momentum As of early 2026, Sancus has shown significant operational improvements that the market price (and spread) may not yet fully reflect.  A recent 32% increase in turnover (to approximately \u00a322.1m) means without a shadow of a doubt that their specialised property bridging and development finance model is gaining serious traction. The company estimated a jump from a nominal \u00a30.1m profit to over \u00a31.0m. This \"inflection point\" is often where small-cap stocks see the most dramatic growth. New Lending: A 96% increase in new lending facilities (\u00a3212m) indicates a massive expansion in their pipeline. This ladies and gentlemen is a very strong buy in my honest opinion. GL",

The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit. The Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m). During the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m). The Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning.    During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs.  The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m). As a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability. The Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in March 2026. For further information, please contact:",

By buying now, you are essentially paying a \"liquidity premium\" today to capture the significant upside potential before the rest of the market arrives. Strong Fundamental Momentum As of early 2026, Sancus has shown significant operational improvements that the market price (and spread) may not yet fully reflect.  A recent 32% increase in turnover (to approximately \u00a322.1m) means without a shadow of a doubt that their specialised property bridging and development finance model is gaining serious traction. The company estimated a jump from a nominal \u00a30.1m profit to over \u00a31.0m. This \"inflection point\" is often where small-cap stocks see the most dramatic growth. New Lending: A 96% increase in new lending facilities (\u00a3212m) indicates a massive expansion in their pipeline. This ladies and gentlemen is a very strong buy in my honest opinion. GL",

          "content": "Sancus Lending Group Limited (\"Sancus\" the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") Trading Update Sancus Lending Group Limited (AIM: LEND) provides the following update on its results for the year ended 31 December 2025. The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit. The Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m). During the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m). The Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning.    During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs.  The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m). As a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability. The Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in March 2026. For further information, please contact:",

Conservative Forecast: 2.50p \u2013 2.80p. This assumes the market digests the recent gains and waits for the audited results in March 2026. 5.00p+, assumes Sancus announces a major new funding partner or a further reduction in debt (ZDP repurchases) later this year.

By buying now, you are essentially paying a \"liquidity premium\" today to capture the significant upside potential before the rest of the market arrives. Strong Fundamental Momentum As of early 2026, Sancus has shown significant operational improvements that the market price (and spread) may not yet fully reflect.  A recent 32% increase in turnover (to approximately \u00a322.1m) means without a shadow of a doubt that their specialised property bridging and development finance model is gaining serious traction. The company estimated a jump from a nominal \u00a30.1m profit to over \u00a31.0m. This \"inflection point\" is often where small-cap stocks see the most dramatic growth. New Lending: A 96% increase in new lending facilities (\u00a3212m) indicates a massive expansion in their pipeline. This ladies and gentlemen is a very strong buy in my honest opinion. GL",

          "content": "Sancus Lending Group Limited (\"Sancus\" the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") Trading Update Sancus Lending Group Limited (AIM: LEND) provides the following update on its results for the year ended 31 December 2025. The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit. The Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m). During the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m). The Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning.    During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs.  The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m). As a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability. The Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in March 2026. For further information, please contact:",

Currently, the stock is trading at a significant discount to its peer group's average Price-to-Sales and Book Value, because of the wide spread and low liquidity, price movement is often \"lumpy\"\u2014it stays flat for days and then will move 30% ii a few hours. Conservative Forecast: 2.50p \u2013 2.80p. This assumes the market digests the recent gains and waits for the audited results in March 2026. 5.00p+, assumes Sancus announces a major new funding partner or a further reduction in debt (ZDP repurchases) later this year. The management is solid now with fantastic people at the top.",

By buying now, you are essentially paying a \"liquidity premium\" today to capture the significant upside potential before the rest of the market arrives. Strong Fundamental Momentum As of early 2026, Sancus has shown significant operational improvements that the market price (and spread) may not yet fully reflect.  A recent 32% increase in turnover (to approximately \u00a322.1m) means without a shadow of a doubt that their specialised property bridging and development finance model is gaining serious traction. The company estimated a jump from a nominal \u00a30.1m profit to over \u00a31.0m. This \"inflection point\" is often where small-cap stocks see the most dramatic growth. New Lending: A 96% increase in new lending facilities (\u00a3212m) indicates a massive expansion in their pipeline. This ladies and gentlemen is a very strong buy in my honest opinion. GL",

The figures in this announcement remain subject to audit. The Group increased turnover by 32% to approximately \u00a322.1m (2024: \u00a316.8m). This performance reflects continued strong growth in the Group's core UK and Irish businesses, both of which delivered robust results despite a challenging market environment. The Group's Channel Islands business also recorded an improved performance. The Company currently estimates that it will report a significantly improved profit before tax slightly in excess of \u00a31.0m (2024: \u00a30.1m). During the year, the Company wrote new lending facilities totalling \u00a3212m, representing a 96% increase (2024: \u00a3108m). At the year end, the Group had loans under management of approximately \u00a3317m, an increase of 33% (31 December 2024: \u00a3238m). The Board is encouraged by the Group's trading performance and the progress being made to enhance its strategic and operational positioning.    During the year, the Group took further steps to reducing leverage and future financing risk through additional repurchases of its ZDPs.  The expected profit before tax referred to above includes gains of \u00a32.6m from these actions (2024: \u00a32.8m). As a result of these actions and the progress and resilience demonstrated by the Group's core businesses, the Board remains confident in the Group's future prospects. The Group looks forward to delivering further growth in 2026 across its core lending businesses which, together with maintaining disciplined cost and loan underwriting control, should deliver run-rate profitability. The Group expects to release its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2025 in March 2026. For further information, please contact:",
