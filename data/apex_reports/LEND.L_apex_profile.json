In the eight months to 31 August 2024 the Company achieved revenues of \u00a310.0 million versus \u00a37.8 million in the eight months to 31 August 2023. As at 31 August 2024 the Company had written \u00a367 million of new loan facilities in the year to date versus \u00a351 million as at 30 June 2024. As at 31 August 2024 loans under management were \u00a3218 million. The Company continues to experience stable credit quality and management is confident of continued growth in its loan volumes for the remainder of 2024 as it continues to work towards achieving long term profitability.\nProposed Amendments to the Bonds\nThe Company is seeking to extend the maturity date of the Bonds from 31 December 2025 to 31 October 2027 and is offering to increase the coupon payable for the remaining duration of the Bonds from 7% to 8%. In addition, the Company is seeking to increase the maximum principal amount of the Bonds that may be issued from \u00a315 million, up to the maximum level of borrowing prescribed by the terms of the Company's ZDP Shares (subject to exclusions) of \u00a330 million. As at 30 June the Company had total borrowings of \u00a327 million, comprising \u00a315 million in respect of the Bonds and \u00a312 million in respect of the carrying value of the Company's ZDP Shares.\nFull details of the proposed Bondholder Resolution will be set out in the Bondholder Circular being distributed to Bondholders today. If the proposed resolution is passed it will take effect from 31 October 2024.\n\u200b\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham\nKeith Lawrence\n+44 (0)1481 708 280\nPanmure Liberum Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker)\nChris Clarke\nWilliam King\n+44 (0) 20 3100 2000\nInstinctif Partners\u00a0(PR Advisor)\nHannah Scott\nAugustine Chipungu\n+44 (0)20 7457 2020\nApex Group Ltd\nMatt Falla\nNicola Momberg\n+44 (0)1481 755530\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

All of the ZDP Shares purchased will be cancelled. No ZDP Shares were acquired by Somerston.\nFollowing the above transaction, the Company has 16,314,551 ZDP Shares in issue, of which 11,894,628 ZDP Shares are held by the Company as treasury shares. The total number of ZDP Share voting rights is therefore 4,419,923.\nThis figure of 4,419,923 may be used by holders of ZDP Shares as the denominator for the calculations by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the ZDP Shares under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nIssue of Bonds\nAs announced on 13 November 2024, the ZDP Share Buyback was funded by the issue by the Company to Somerston of 8 per cent. unsecured Bonds. Pursuant to a conditional subscription from Somerston, subject to completion of the ZDP Share Buyback, Bonds have been issued to Somerston in an aggregate principal amount of \u00a32,003,303.\nCancellation of Listing of ZDP Shares\nFollowing its announcement on 13 November 2024, the Company confirms that the Cancellation of the ZDP Shares is expected to become effective at 7.00 a.m. on 11 December 2024. Applications have been made to the FCA and the LSE to effect a Cancellation of the ZDP Shares in the non-equity shares and non-voting equity shares category of the Official List and to trading on the Main Market.\nFollowing the Cancellation, in respect of the ZDP Shares, the Company will no longer be subject to the regulatory and statutory regime which applies to companies admitted to listing in the non-equity shares and non-voting equity shares category of the Official List and traded on the Main Market.\nThe Cancellation will not apply to the Company's Ordinary Shares, which will continue to be admitted to trading on the AIM market of the LSE.\nTransactions in the ZDP Shares post the Cancellation\nZDP Shareholders should note that they are able to continue to trade in the ZDP Shares on the Main Market following the ZDP Share Buyback and prior to the effective date of Cancellation.\nThe Company wishes to remind holders of its ZDP Shares that, if a ZDP Shareholder retains their ZDP Shares following the Cancellation, although the ZDP Shares will remain freely tradeable, they will no longer be tradeable on the Main Market and no other formal facility (such as CREST) will be available to facilitate the trading of the ZDP Shares.\nAll ZDP Shareholders should note that following Cancellation the ability for ZDP Shareholders to dispose of their ZDP Shares will be significantly diminished and will be dependent on there being a willing buyer for those ZDP Shares at such time.\nThose ZDP Shareholders who hold their ZDP Shares in CREST will be sent share certificates for their holding by 31 December 2024.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall have the same meanings as set out in the Company's announcement on 13 November 2024 '\nCancellation of ZDP Share Listing and Buyback\n'.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSancus Lending Group Limited\nRory Mepham\nKeith Lawrence\n+44 (0)1481 708 280\nPanmure Liberum Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker)\nChris Clarke\nWilliam King\n+44 (0) 20 3100 2000\nInstinctif Partners\u00a0(PR Advisor)\nHannah Scott\nAugustine Chipungu\n+44 (0)20 7457 2020\nApex Group Ltd\nMatt Falla\nNicola Momberg\n+44 (0)1481 755530\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
