The Group reported an operating profit in the Financial Year of \u00a3118,000 (2024: loss \u00a31,215,000), a loss before taxation for the Financial Year of \u00a3310,000 (2024: loss \u00a31,639,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a3259,000 (2024: loss \u00a3821,000). The loss per share for the Financial Year was 0.71p (2024: loss per share 2.26p).\nWell, that was another very challenging year! Obviously, there were repercussions and fall out from the demise of QM Systems, but the remaining teams and businesses have buckled down and grown remaining core turnover by 27% from \u00a32.9 million to \u00a33.7 million and I am confident that we shall continue to grow and will have soon clawed our way back to profitability, indeed on an EBITDA basis this year was positive to the tune of \u00a3207,000.\nWhilst I was cautiously optimistic this time last year that our core businesses were in the right industries which would be less affected by private sector lack of confidence because they service the utilities, government and rail industries, it sadly transpires that either funding has been cut or delayed or, where it has been made available, there is significant indecision on where and how to spend it. Accordingly, we are increasingly looking to overseas markets to sell our products and expertise. This bodes well for the future but does involve longer gestation periods.\nFinally, I would like to pay tribute to all of our staff, subsidiary board directors and main board directors for all their hard work and loyalty as we strive to achieve further progress at each of our businesses. In particular, I salute Randal MacDonnell, PipeHawk's highly respected and valued non-executive director who sadly passed away in September, and whose advice, tenacity and good humour will be sorely missed. We intend to appoint an additional non-executive director to the Board in due course.\nThomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\")\nTED finished the year on a high, increasing its turnover from \u00a31.14 million to \u00a31.77 million, growth of over 55% compared to 2024. This resulted in a healthy post-tax profit of \u00a3156k (2024: loss \u00a3104k).\nThe partnership between TED and Unipart continues to flourish, with the additional exposure and sales network Unipart brings to the partnership through marketing strategies and exhibitions combined with TED's newly developed High Output machinery and our other rail attachment offerings.\nExhibiting at the IAF exhibition show in Munster, Germany in May 2025 gained a high footfall of potential clients with serious interest in our rail equipment. Major interest is coming predominantly from Brazil, North America and India, and the machine methodology is being embedded into high profile infrastructure projects due to come to fruition in 2026.\nTED also showcased its rail attachments and special purpose machinery at the UK's largest rail event, Rail Live in June this year.\nThis led to sales leads and requests for quotes (\"RFQs\") of over \u00a3500k, some of which are now entering our order book destined for maintenance work on the London Underground Rail Network.\nTransport for London and the London Underground have approved TED machinery to be utilised for on-going and future maintenance projects.\nThe release of CP7 contracts to UK rail infrastructure for tier 1 and 2 contractors remains cautious and therefore our clients spend is being withheld until they are guaranteed the work bank. However, RFQs remain steady even though the gestation period for some RFQs is slow but seems to be gathering momentum as renewals and maintenance projects are released and confidence returns.\nThe outlook for 2026 and beyond is very positive.\nAdien Ltd (\"Adien\")\nThe last financial year for Adien proved to be positive overall. The Adien staff have settled well into their new premises and have managed to make a number of efficiencies as a result.\nAdien had a very strong start to the financial year with all teams at full occupation throughout almost the whole six-month period. Unfortunately, the second half of the year proved more difficult, with one very large infrastructure project which had been scheduled to start in mid-January getting progressively delayed until the end of spring. Adien had gone to great lengths in planning and accommodating the project only for the proposed start day to be delayed by three months. It then proved difficult to get full utilisation out of the teams during that three-month period at very short notice. Structural changes have been put in place to minimise the likelihood of such instances occurring moving forward and, in the unlikely event that they do, to mitigate their impact.\nThe project pipeline in 2025 has become somewhat difficult to navigate as a number of sectors that were expecting to see reasonable growth indicated that there will be little to no spend in 2025 and 2026. This primarily relates to anything MOD and local council related. MOD has shelved virtually all plans regarding barracks development/expansion or refurbishment. Likewise, there were several plans in relation to town/city centre regeneration projects which have also been shelved fully. There appears to be a lot of uncertainty and lack of commitment within the construction industry as a whole currently.\nHowever, on the positive side, Adien is doing well within the Telecoms, Water and Power industries with reasonable year on year growth. This is where we will continue our focus. Orders are strong here and have provided us with a nearly complete programme of works until the end of the calendar year. Coupled with our new CCTV division, it is anticipated that Adien will see good growth in the next year.\nUtsi Electronics Ltd (\"Utsi\")\nDespite global events stretching both customer relationships and supply chain timescales, throughout the year, as well as disrupting access to some regional markets, our plan for growth has continued to deliver tangible results, with turnover up over 30%, for the second year in succession, now bringing our bottom line within touching distance of being positive. While UK market sales have remained flat, sales to EU and ROW have been buoyant in comparison. As we have continued to re-establish ourselves within existing markets, we have also expanded the boundaries of our expertise into adjacent technologies, creating new opportunities for sideward growth. Our fostering of deeper relationships with our distribution chain; based on the prospect of mutual innovation - mutual growth, has also begun to open new doors, to work with international distributors, operating in allied fields, to provide additional customer specific requirements. While the timely sourcing of materials remains a concern. The future for Utsi continues to be bright and full of promise.\nFinancial position\nThe Group continues to be in a net liability position and is still reliant on my continuing financial support.\nMy letter of support dated 26 November 2023 was renewed on 16 November 2025 to provide the Group with financial support until 31 December 2026. Loans due to me, other than those covered by the CULS (as defined below) agreement, are unsecured and accrue interest at an annual rate of Bank of England base rate plus 2.15%.\nThe Group's \u00a31.0 million convertible unsecured loan stock issued to me (the \"CULS\") was renewed on 30 June 2022 and extended on identical terms, such that the CULS are now repayable on 13 August 2026. Further details of the CULS were most recently announced by the Group on 26 September 2024.\nIn addition to the loans I have provided to the Company in previous years, I have deferred a certain proportion of fees and the interest due on loans I have provided until the Company is in a suitably strong position to make the full payments. During the Financial Year, the deferred element of fees and interest amounted to \u00a3259,000 and the aggregate amount of deferred fees and interest outstanding to me as at the end of the Financial Year amounted to approximately \u00a32.0 million in total, all of which has been recognised as a liability in the Company's accounts.\nStrategy & Outlook\nThe Group remains committed to creating sustainable earnings-based growth and focusing on the expansion of its business with forward-looking products and services. PipeHawk acts responsibly towards its shareholders, business partners, employees, society and the environment in each of its business areas.\nPipeHawk is committed to technologies and products that unite the goals of customer value and sustainable development. Despite wider current market conditions, all divisions of the Group are currently performing well, and I remain optimistic in my outlook for the Group.\nGordon Watt\nExecutive Chairman\nDate: 24 November 2025\nIndependent auditor's report for the year ended 30 June 2025\n\"Opinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of PipeHawk Plc (the \"Parent Company\") and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") for the year ended 30 June 2025 which comprise:\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of financial position and Parent company statement of financial position\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of cash flow and Parent company statement of cash flow\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of changes in equity and Parent company statement of changes in equity and\n\u2022 the Notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\n\u2022 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's affairs as at 30 June 2025 and of its loss for the year then ended.\n\u2022 have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards; and\n\u2022 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that due to the financial requirements of the Group and the Parent Company, the Executive Chairman, G.G. Watt, will provide ongoing financial support for a period of at least twelve months from the approval date of the financial statements. These events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u2022 The information given in the strategic report and the report of the directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u2022 The strategic report and the report of the directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u2022 adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u2022 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u2022 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u2022 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 12, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\nOur approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:\n\u2022 we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the computer component manufacturing and supply sector;\n\u2022 we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006 and taxation legislation;\n\u2022 we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of management and inspecting legal correspondence; and\n\u2022 identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:\n\u2022 making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and\n\u2022 considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.\nTo address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:\n\u2022 performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;\n\u2022 tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions; and\n\u2022 investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.\nIn response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which included, but were not limited to:\n\u2022 agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;\n\u2022 reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;\n\u2022 enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.\nThere are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.\nA further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nMaterial misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve deliberate concealment or collusion.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

General information\nPipeHawk plc (the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") is a public limited company incorporated in the England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The addresses of its registered office and principal place of business are disclosed in the company information section on page 1. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) are described on page 7.\nThe financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of all companies in the Group. In accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate statement of comprehensive income for the parent Company has not been presented.\n1.2. Basis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (IAS) The principal accounting policies are set out below.\nAdoption of new and revised standards\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and, in some cases, have not yet been adopted by the UK. The directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company and Group in future periods.\n1.3. Basis of preparation - Going concern\nThe directors have reviewed the Parent Company and Group's funding requirements for the next twelve months which show positive anticipated cash flow generation, prior to any repayment of loans advanced by the Executive Chairman. The preparation of cash flow forecasts for the Group requires estimates to be made of the quantum and timing of cash receipts from future commercial revenues and the timing of future expenditure. The board consider that\nthe challenging political, economic and financial backdrop in the UK presents uncertainties for the group to achieve its revenue growth forecasts\n. The directors have obtained a renewed pledge from G G Watt to provide ongoing financial support including additional funding if required for a period of at least twelve months from the approval date of the Group and Parent Company statement of financial positions. The directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the entity has adequate resources to continue in its operational exercises for the foreseeable future. It is on this basis that the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of preparation within these financial statements. However, a material uncertainty exists regarding the ability of the Group and Parent Company to remain a going concern without the continuing financial support of the Executive Chairman.\nThe financial statement does not include adjustments which would arise in the event of not being a going concern.\n1.4. Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n1.5. Business combinations\nAcquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations.\nGoodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.\n1.6. Goodwill\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.\nIf the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\nOn disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n1.7. Revenue recognition\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services are recognised as control transfers to the customer in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 as follows:\nIdentify the contract with the customer\nA legally enforceable contract is entered into with a customer for the construction of a piece of equipment, or for the design and preparation of complete software and hardware test solutions and the provision of specialist surveying.\nIdentify the performance obligation\nThe performance obligation for the sale of goods is the construction and delivery of the specified equipment as per the contractual agreement and is satisfied over time as the work progresses.\nThe performance obligation for the sale of services is the design and preparation of complete software and hardware test solutions and the provision of specialist surveying as per the contractual agreement and is satisfied over time as the work progresses and control transfers to the customer.\nDetermine transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company expected to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised equipment to the customer. This includes fixed contract prices, and where applicable, estimated variable consideration, which is only included to the extent that it is highly probably that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\nAllocate the transaction price\nA revenue contract contains a single performance obligation with no separately satisfiable obligations. Therefore, the contract value is the transaction price.\nRecognise revenue\nRevenue is recognised over time as control passes to the customer. Revenue invoices are raised to the customer on a stage of completion basis, or on shorter term projects invoices are issued on completion. Where this results in a timing difference between revenue invoiced and revenue allowed a resulting contract asset or contract liability is recognised on the balance sheet.\nContract asset: When the company has incurred actual direct costs beyond the point of which revenue invoices have been raised, a contract asset is recognised for the amount of actual direct costs in excess of total revenue invoices raised.\nContract liabilities: When the company has invoiced the customer at a stage of completion beyond the point of which actual direct costs have been incurred, a contract liability is recognised for the amount which aggregate revenue invoices raised exceeds the amount of actual direct costs incurred.\n1.8. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty is valued on a fair value basis, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Assets held under leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nThe principal annual rates used to depreciate property, plant and equipment are:\nFreehold land and buildings 1% / 2%\nEquipment, fixtures and fittings 20% / 25%\nMotor vehicles 25%\n1.9. Inventories and work in progress\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs, including an appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead expenses, are assigned to inventories by the method most appropriate to the particular class of inventory, with the majority being valued on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\nWork in progress is valued at cost, which includes expenses incurred on behalf of clients and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable costs on incomplete assignments. The value of work in progress is reduced where appropriate to provide for irrecoverable costs\n.\n1.10. Financial assets\nThe Group's financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The Group's accounting policy for each category of financial asset is as follows:\nFinancial assets held at amortised cost\nTrade receivables and other receivables are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.\nImpairment provisions are recognised based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.\nThe Group's financial assets held at amortised cost comprise other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\nEquity instruments\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n1.11. Leased/Right of Use assets\nThe leases liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the individual entities incremental borrowing rate. The lease term comprises the non-cancellable period of the contract, together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option based on operational needs and contractual terms. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, and reducing it by the lease payments made. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option.\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs. Subsequently, right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liability.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease. The Group has elected to apply exemptions for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. For these leases, payments are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Right-of-use assets are presented within non-current assets on the face of the statement of financial position, and lease liabilities are shown separately on the statement of financial position in current liabilities and non-current liabilities depending on the maturity of the lease payments.\nUnder IFRS16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets.\nPayments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.\n1.12. Pension scheme contributions\nPension contributions are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they fall due. All pension costs are in relation to defined contribution schemes.\n1.13. Share based payments\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 18.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each statement of financial position date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.\n1.14. Foreign currencies\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 30 June. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transactions, and processed through the profit & loss account.\n1.15. Taxation\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nCurrent and deferred tax for the year\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the statement of comprehensive income, except when they relate to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity.\n1.16. Impairment of property, plant and equipment\nAt each year end date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable\namount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n1.17. Research and development\nThe Group undertakes research and development to expand its activity in technology and innovation to develop new products that will begin directly generating revenue in the future. Expenditure on research is expensed as incurred, development expenditure is capitalised only if the criteria for capitalisation are recognised in IAS 38. The Company claims tax credits on its research and development activity and recognises the income in current tax.\n1.18. Government grants\nDuring the period, the Group received benefits from Government grants totalling \u00a3 nil (2024: 18,000).\n1.19. Critical judgement in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the directors have made in the process of applying the entity's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financial statements.\nThe estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nCritical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies\nThe following are the critical judgement/s, apart from those involving estimations that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nPipeHawk consolidated accounts operate under IFRS 15 which adopts the following approach to recognising revenue.\nRevenue on long-term projects is recognised on the percentage of completion method (unless a loss is forecast on that project), they state the significant risks and rewards are transferred and that the recognition of revenue over the duration of a contract is appropriate as enforceable contracts are in place.\nEach project is customer specific and has an enforceable contract. Throughout the project each project is assessed individually by the management to ascertain the percentage of revenue recognised and this is continually updated throughout the project. As each project is specific to customer and we can enforce the contract, we have applied percentage complete basis at year end rather than transfer of significant risks and rewards basis of ownership. The directors are satisfied that percentage completion remains the appropriate critical judgement.\nKey source of estimation uncertainty\nThe key assumption concerning estimation at the balance sheet date, with a risk of causing any adjustment to carrying amounts in the assets and liabilities within the next financial year, would be in relation to the valuations of the properties owned by the group.\nThe management believe the current estimates are accurate based on revaluation and are now more in line with their true value. The buildings are an integral part of the businesses future as going concerns, and there is currently no plan to sell, so therefore the risk is not deemed as significant.\nGoing concern\nThe preparation of cash flow forecasts for the Group requires estimates to be made of the quantum and timing of cash receipts from future commercial revenues and the timing of future expenditure, all of which are subject to uncertainty, see Basis of preparation - Going concern note 1.3\n2 Segmental analysis\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nTurnover by geographical market\nUnited Kingdom\n3,296\n8,739\nEurope\n49\n82\nOther\n398\n317\n3,743\n9,138\nThe Group operates out of one geographical location being the UK. Accordingly, the primary segmental disclosure is based on activity. Per IFRS 8 operating segments are based on internal reports about components of the Group, which are regularly reviewed and used by Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), the current executive chairman, for strategic decision making and resource allocation, in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. The Group's reportable operating segments are as follows\n:\n\u00b7\nAdien Limited - Utility detection and mapping services - Sale of services\n\u00b7\nUtsi Electronics Limited - Development, assembly and sale of GPR equipment - Sale of goods\n\u00b7\nThomson Engineering Design Limited - Rail trackside solutions (included in the test system solutions segment) - Sale of services\n\u00b7\nWessex Precision Instruments Limited - Non trading\nThe CODM monitors the operating results of each segment for the purpose of performance assessments and making decisions on resource allocation. Performance is based on revenue generations and profit before tax, which the CODM believes are the most relevant in evaluating the results relative to other entities in the industry.\nInformation regarding each of the operations of each reportable segment is included below, all non-current assets owned by the Group are held in the UK.\nUtility detection and mapping services\nDevelopment, assembly and sale of GPR equipment\nAutomation and test system solutions\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 June 2025\nTotal segmental revenue\n1,537\n433\n1,773\n3,743\nOperating (loss) / profit\n68\n(114)\n164\n118\nFinance costs\n(53)\n(350)\n(25)\n(428)\n(Loss) / Profit before taxation\n15\n(464)\n139\n(310)\nSegment assets\n612\n430\n597\n1,639\nSegment liabilities\n659\n6,510\n878\n8,047\nNon-current asset additions\nRevaluation reserve-property\n3\n-\n-\n93\n15\n48\n18\n141\nDepreciation and amortisation\n44\n17\n109\n170\nUtility detection and mapping services\nDevelopment, assembly and sale of GPR equipment\nAutomation and test system solutions\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 June 2024\nTotal segmental revenue\n1,448\n330\n7,360\n9,138\nOperating (loss) / profit\n85\n154\n(1,454)\n(1,215)\nFinance costs\n(35)\n(335)\n(54)\n(424)\n(Loss) / Profit before taxation\n50\n(181)\n(1,508)\n(1,639)\nSegment assets\n497\n322\n1,112\n1,931\nSegment liabilities\n579\n6,319\n1,220\n8,118\nNon-current asset additions\n48\n-\n47\n95\nDepreciation and amortisation\n60\n18\n541\n619\n3 Finance costs\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nInterest payable\n428\n424\n428\n424\nInterest payable comprises interest on:\nLeases\n11\n23\nDirectors' loans\n259\n259\nOther\n158\n142\n428\n424\n4 Operating profit for the year\nThis is arrived at after charging for the Group:\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nResearch and development costs not capitalised\n611\n602\nDepreciation and amortisation\nImpairment of goodwill\nImpairment of stock recognised as an expense\n170\n-\n7\n619\n163\n10\nAuditor's remuneration\nFees payable to the Company's auditor for the audit of the Group's financial statements\n33\n53\nFees payable to the Company's auditor and its subsidiaries for the provision of tax services\n5\n-\nThe Company's audit fee is \u00a318,000 (2024: \u00a329,000).\n5 Staff costs\nGroup\n2025\n2024\nNo.\nNo.\nAverage monthly number of employees, including directors:\nProduction and research\n33\n89\nSelling and research\n5\n9\nAdministration\n9\n10\n47\n108\nGroup\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nStaff costs, including directors:\nWages and salaries\n1,454\n4,313\nSocial security costs\n143\n414\nOther pension costs\n77\n227\n1,674\n4,954\nCompany\n2025\n2024\nNo.\nNo.\nAverage monthly number of employees, including directors:\nSelling and research\n-\n-\nAdministration\n1\n1\n1\n1\nCompany\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nStaff costs, including directors:\nWages and salaries\n124\n82\nSocial security costs\n-\n-\nOther pension costs\n-\n-\n124\n82\n6 Directors' remuneration\nSalary\nand fees\nBenefits\nin kind\n2025\nTotal\n2024\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nG G Watt\n71\n-\n71\n71\nR MacDonnell\n2\n-\n2\n2\nT Williams\n10\n-\n10\n9\nAggregate emoluments\n83\n-\n83\n82\nDirectors' pensions\n2025\n2024\nNo.\nNo.\nThe number of directors who are accruing retirement benefits under:\nDefined contributions policies\n-\n-\nThe directors represent key management personnel.\nRefer to note 18 for details of directors share options.\n7\nTaxation\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nUnited Kingdom Corporation Tax\nCurrent taxation\n(51)\n(68)\nAdjustments in respect of prior years\n-\n120\n(51)\n52\nDeferred taxation\n-\n-\nTax on loss\n(51)\n52\nCurrent tax reconciliation\nTaxable loss for the year\n(310)\n(1,639)\nTheoretical tax at UK corporation tax rate 19% (2024: 19%)\n(59)\n(383)\nEffects of:\nR&D tax credit adjustments\n(99)\n(38)\nFixed asset timing differences\n1\n4\nNot deductible for tax purposes\nImpairment of goodwill\n8\n-\n259\n(31)\nDeferred tax not recognised\n98\n229\nAdjustments in respect of prior years\n-\n120\nUtilisation of losses\n-\n1\nShort term timing differences\n-\n(109)\nTotal income tax (credit) / charge\n( 51)\n52\nThe Group has tax losses amounting to approximately \u00a33,293,000 (2024: \u00a33,807,000), available for carry forward to set off against future trading profits\n.

Directors' loans comprise of two elements. A loan attracting interest at 2.15% over Bank of England base rate. At the year-end \u00a32,336,000 (2024: \u00a32,342,000) was outstanding in relation to this loan. During the year to 30 June 2025 \u00a3241,000 (2024: \u00a3543,000) was repaid. The Company has the right to defer payment for a period of 366 days.\nOn 13 August 2010 the Company issued \u00a31 million of Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock (\"CULS\") to G.G Watt, the Chairman of the Company. The CULS were issued to replace loans made by G.G Watt to the Company amounting to \u00a31 million and has been recognised in non-current liabilities of \u00a33,336,000.\nPursuant to amendments made on 13 November 2014, 9 November 2018 and 30 June 2022 the principal terms of the CULS are as follows:\n- The CULS may be converted at the option of Gordon Watt at a price of p per share at any time prior to 13 August 2026;\n- Interest is payable at a rate of 10 per cent per annum on the principal amount outstanding until converted, prepaid or repaid, calculated and compounded on each anniversary of the issue of the CULS. On conversion of any CULS, any unpaid interest shall be paid within 20 days of such conversion;\n- The CULS are repayable, together with accrued interest on 13 August 2026 (\"the Repayment Date\").\nNo equity element of the convertible loan stock was recognised on issue of the instrument as it was not considered to be material.\nBank and other loans\nIncluded in bank and other loans is an invoice discounting facility of \u00a3218,774 (2024: \u00a3170,766).\nThe principal terms of which are interest at 2.58% over Bank of England base rate and secured on the company's debtors.\nIncluded in bank and other loans is a secured mortgage of \u00a378,417 which incurs an interest rate of 2.44% over base rate for 10 years and at a rate of 2.64% over base thereafter.\nAs a result of COVID 19, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) became available for the business. This enabled the group to secure two loans. The loan for \u00a3400,000 had a remaining balance outstanding of \u00a387,000, at a rate of 3.96%, over base and the second loan of \u00a3150,000 had a remaining balance outstanding of \u00a340,000, at a rate of 2.96% over base.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group's operations.\nThe main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. A number of procedures are in place to enable these risks to be controlled. For liquidity risk these include profit/cash forecasts by business segment, quarterly management accounts and comparison against forecast. The board reviews and agrees policies for managing this risk on a regular basis.\nCredit risk\nThe credit risk exposure is the carrying amount of the financial assets as shown in note 14 (with the exception of prepayments which are not financial assets) and the exposure to the cash balances. Of the amounts owed to the Group at 30 June 2025, the top 3 customers comprised 70% (2024: 41%) of total trade receivables.\nThe Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and the Group uses its own trading records to rate its major customers, also the Group invoices in advance where possible. The Group's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Having regard to the credit worthiness of the Groups significant customers the directors believe that the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.\nWithin revenue there are two customers which individually represent 22.4% and 10.0% of the overall revenue for the financial year, this compared to 11.8% and 9.1% in the previous financial year\n.\nAn analysis of trade and other receivables:\n2025\nWeighted average loss rate\nGross carrying\nvalue\nImpairment loss allowance\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nPerforming\n0.00%\n728\n-\n2024\nWeighted average loss rate\nGross carrying value\nImpairment loss allowance\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nPerforming\n0.00%\n1,007\n-\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group finances its operations through a mixture of shareholders' funds and borrowings. The Group borrows exclusively in Sterling and principally at fixed and floating rates of interest and are disclosed at note 16.\nAs disclosed in note 16 the Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on its borrowings with a variable element of interest. If interest rates were to increase by one percentage point the interest charge would be \u00a323,000 higher. An equivalent decrease would be incurred if interest rates were reduced by one percentage point.\nLiquidity risk\nAs stated in note 1 the Executive Chairman, G.G Watt, has pledged to provide ongoing financial support for a period of at least twelve months from the approval date of the Group statement of financial position. It is on this basis that the directors consider that neither the Group nor the Company is exposed to a significant liquidity risk.\nContractual maturity analysis for financial liabilities:\n2025\nLess than\n1 year\nDue between\n1-2 years\nDue between\n2 - 5+ years\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTrade and other payables\n966\n-\n-\n966\nBorrowings\nLease liability\n3,285\n116\n3,540\n25\n42\n56\n6,867\n197\n4,367\n3,565\n98\n8,030\n2024\nLess than\n1 year\nDue between\n1-2 years\nDue between\n2 - 5+ years\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTrade and other payables\n1,374\n121\n-\n1,495\nBorrowings\nLease liability\n2,818\n111\n3,614\n96\n70\n-\n6,502\n207\n4,303\n3,831\n70\n8,204\nFinancial liabilities of the Company are all due within less than three months with the exception of the intercompany balances that are due between 1 and 5 years.\nFair value of financial instruments\nLoans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.

          "content": "14 Mar 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 6366A\nPipeHawk PLC\n14 March 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) no. 596/2014 (which forms part of domestic UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018)\u00a0(\"MAR\"). With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n14 March 2025\nPipeHawk plc\n(\"PipeHawk\", \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nUnaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2024\nChairman's Statement\nIn my Chairman's Statement accompanying the unaudited interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2023 (\"H1 2023\"), I congratulated the Governor of the Bank of England on delivering a sterling job of dampening down demand such that, with associated economic and political headwinds, very few new orders were placed during the period concerned, with the notable exception of Adien Ltd (\"Aiden\"). This continued negative sentiment coupled with two anticipated material orders not being forthcoming ultimately contributed to QM Systems Limited (\"QM\") being placed into administration just as the six-month period on which I am now reporting started.\nNevertheless, PipeHawk's remaining key subsidiaries have performed well in the circumstances enabling the Group to report a return to net profitability. The Group's turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2024 was \u00a32,089,000 (H1 2023: \u00a34,572,000). This represented a decrease of approximately 54% over the comparable period last year, which included QM, although represented an increase of approximately 83% if QM's turnover of \u00a33,431,000 for H1 2023 is excluded. The Group's profit before taxation was \u00a329,000 (H1 2023: loss before tax of \u00a3633,000; \u00a3203,000 loss before tax if QM is excluded) and the Group's profit after taxation was \u00a359,000 (H1 2023: loss after tax of \u00a3441,000).\nAs mentioned in November 2024 in the annual report and accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group's remaining key subsidiaries service the utilities, government and rail industries and, hence, are significantly less reliant on the confidence of private sector businesses to commit funds for major investment projects. Though, somewhat ironically, while Network Rail has a reported budget of \u00a344 billion to spend on UK rail infrastructure in the five years from April 2024, Network Rail seems very reticent to place orders with its Tier 1 suppliers. As a result, the start to the current calendar year has been slower than that I would have wished. Nevertheless, the prospective order book across all three operating subsidiaries remains buoyant, and I am confident that the overall recovery will continue.\nThomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\")\nTED continues to see steady activity for request for quotes (\"RFQs\") in the UK for strategic equipment as contracts are slowly released from Network Rail. This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year.\nSome of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure.\nThe strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.\nThe respective regional Unipart sales teams are now tasked with following up those leads to bring them to fruition.\nPlans are now established also to exhibit TED's innovative products at the IAF Technology Show in Germany in May 2025, which is the largest exhibition for track technology in Europe, occurring only once every three years.\nWe believe that the proactive continuation of Unipart's global marketing initiatives will ensure that TED's products are embedded in future rail infrastructure projects around the world.\nThe Unipart rail attachment business remains stable with a regular monthly order intake, as sales relationships are firmly established around the world, including most recently in Australia, Canada, America and France.\nAdien\nJuly to December 2024 proved to be a positive period for Adien, off the back of strong activity from the sales team in the first six months of that year. In this regard, Adien was at 95%+ capacity during this half-year period. Much of this activity saw Adien mainly committed to the Scottish and Southern Electricity (\"SSE\") projects together with a healthy number of ministry of defence and telecommunication sites.\nThe current Adien order book is strong, with a few large projects seeing the site teams booked until the end of April 2025. Following on from a refocus regarding networking and marketing, Adien was able to secure a good selection of new clients over this six-month period with purchase orders and commitments for a number of large projects expected to start in the current calendar year.\nAdien has managed to secure around 50% of the new operatives required for our planned further site teams over this period, who are now in training.\nWith the new asset management plan (AMP) phases being issued in the new year for the water industry, Adien's sales team is planning for this and are already looking to several national suppliers for collaboration on a tranche of projects which are expected to start in the summer of 2025.\nUtsi Electronics Ltd (\"Utsi\")\nAs global events continue to affect order schedules across multiple markets, it has been a slower than expected first six months for UTSI but one which carries with it the prospect of a much brighter future.\nWith major customers now more familiar with the cyclical nature of 'the new normal', their returning confidence is being reflected in a more buoyant, regular and substantive order outlook which, on current signs, promises to deliver a busy and more positive year end.\nNegotiating the peaks and troughs of component availability and their corresponding cost fluctuations, in order to effect delivery of these increasing orders will however place greater strains on the Group's cashflow in the short term, as we are forced to move away from using a 'just in time' model.\nWith our continued R&D investment into new product lines and re-design of those existing products which may now provide greater returns from having more time/cost effective build processes, the future for UTSI is looking\nbright.\nFinancial position\nAs announced on 28 November 2024, my letter of financial support was renewed on 20 November 2024 to provide the Group with financial support until 31 December 2025.\nIn addition to the loan I have provided to the Company in previous years, my fellow directors and I have deferred a certain proportion of our fees and interest payments due on loans until the Company is in a suitably strong position to make these payments in full.\u00a0During the six months ended 31 December 2024, these deferred fees and interest payments amounted to approximately \u00a3134,000 in total, all of which have been accrued in the Company's interim results, and at 31 December 2024 amounted in total to \u00a32,169,000.\nGordon Watt\nChairman\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk Plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel no. 01252 338 959\nAllenby Capital (Nomad and Broker)\nDavid Hart / Vivek Bhardwaj\nTel no. 020 3328 5656\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 31 December 2024\n6 months ended 31 December 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\n6 months ended 31 December 2023\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended\n30 June\n2024 (audited)\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n2,089\n4,572\n9,138\nStaff costs\nImpairment of goodwill\n(831)\n-\n(2,404)\n-\n(4,954)\n(163)\nGeneral administrative expenses\n(1,021)\n(2,566)\n(5,236)\nProfit / (Loss) on ordinary activities before interest, taxation and exceptional items\n237\n(398)\n(1,215)\nFinance costs\n(207)\n(235)\n(424)\nProfit / (Loss) before taxation\nand exceptional items\n30\n(633)\n(1,639)\nTaxation credit / (charge)\n29\n192\n(52)\nProfit / (Loss)\nfor the period attributable to equity holders of the Company\n59\n(441)\n(1,691)\nExceptional gains on de-recognition (QM Systems)\n-\n-\n870\nOther comprehensive income\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income / (expense) for the period net of tax\n59\n(441)\n(821)\nProfit / (Loss) per share (pence) -

The Group reported an operating profit in the Financial Year of \u00a3118,000 (2024: loss \u00a31,215,000), a loss before taxation for the Financial Year of \u00a3310,000 (2024: loss \u00a31,639,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a3259,000 (2024: loss \u00a3821,000). The loss per share for the Financial Year was 0.71p (2024: loss per share 2.26p).\nWell, that was another very challenging year! Obviously, there were repercussions and fall out from the demise of QM Systems, but the remaining teams and businesses have buckled down and grown remaining core turnover by 27% from \u00a32.9 million to \u00a33.7 million and I am confident that we shall continue to grow and will have soon clawed our way back to profitability, indeed on an EBITDA basis this year was positive to the tune of \u00a3207,000.\nWhilst I was cautiously optimistic this time last year that our core businesses were in the right industries which would be less affected by private sector lack of confidence because they service the utilities, government and rail industries, it sadly transpires that either funding has been cut or delayed or, where it has been made available, there is significant indecision on where and how to spend it. Accordingly, we are increasingly looking to overseas markets to sell our products and expertise. This bodes well for the future but does involve longer gestation periods.\nFinally, I would like to pay tribute to all of our staff, subsidiary board directors and main board directors for all their hard work and loyalty as we strive to achieve further progress at each of our businesses. In particular, I salute Randal MacDonnell, PipeHawk's highly respected and valued non-executive director who sadly passed away in September, and whose advice, tenacity and good humour will be sorely missed. We intend to appoint an additional non-executive director to the Board in due course.\nThomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\")\nTED finished the year on a high, increasing its turnover from \u00a31.14 million to \u00a31.77 million, growth of over 55% compared to 2024. This resulted in a healthy post-tax profit of \u00a3156k (2024: loss \u00a3104k).\nThe partnership between TED and Unipart continues to flourish, with the additional exposure and sales network Unipart brings to the partnership through marketing strategies and exhibitions combined with TED's newly developed High Output machinery and our other rail attachment offerings.\nExhibiting at the IAF exhibition show in Munster, Germany in May 2025 gained a high footfall of potential clients with serious interest in our rail equipment. Major interest is coming predominantly from Brazil, North America and India, and the machine methodology is being embedded into high profile infrastructure projects due to come to fruition in 2026.\nTED also showcased its rail attachments and special purpose machinery at the UK's largest rail event, Rail Live in June this year.\nThis led to sales leads and requests for quotes (\"RFQs\") of over \u00a3500k, some of which are now entering our order book destined for maintenance work on the London Underground Rail Network.\nTransport for London and the London Underground have approved TED machinery to be utilised for on-going and future maintenance projects.\nThe release of CP7 contracts to UK rail infrastructure for tier 1 and 2 contractors remains cautious and therefore our clients spend is being withheld until they are guaranteed the work bank. However, RFQs remain steady even though the gestation period for some RFQs is slow but seems to be gathering momentum as renewals and maintenance projects are released and confidence returns.\nThe outlook for 2026 and beyond is very positive.\nAdien Ltd (\"Adien\")\nThe last financial year for Adien proved to be positive overall. The Adien staff have settled well into their new premises and have managed to make a number of efficiencies as a result.\nAdien had a very strong start to the financial year with all teams at full occupation throughout almost the whole six-month period.

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n14 March 2025\nPipeHawk plc\n(\"PipeHawk\", \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nUnaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2024\nChairman's Statement\nIn my Chairman's Statement accompanying the unaudited interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2023 (\"H1 2023\"), I congratulated the Governor of the Bank of England on delivering a sterling job of dampening down demand such that, with associated economic and political headwinds, very few new orders were placed during the period concerned, with the notable exception of Adien Ltd (\"Aiden\"). This continued negative sentiment coupled with two anticipated material orders not being forthcoming ultimately contributed to QM Systems Limited (\"QM\") being placed into administration just as the six-month period on which I am now reporting started.\nNevertheless, PipeHawk's remaining key subsidiaries have performed well in the circumstances enabling the Group to report a return to net profitability. The Group's turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2024 was \u00a32,089,000 (H1 2023: \u00a34,572,000). This represented a decrease of approximately 54% over the comparable period last year, which included QM, although represented an increase of approximately 83% if QM's turnover of \u00a33,431,000 for H1 2023 is excluded. The Group's profit before taxation was \u00a329,000 (H1 2023: loss before tax of \u00a3633,000; \u00a3203,000 loss before tax if QM is excluded) and the Group's profit after taxation was \u00a359,000 (H1 2023: loss after tax of \u00a3441,000).\nAs mentioned in November 2024 in the annual report and accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group's remaining key subsidiaries service the utilities, government and rail industries and, hence, are significantly less reliant on the confidence of private sector businesses to commit funds for major investment projects. Though, somewhat ironically, while Network Rail has a reported budget of \u00a344 billion to spend on UK rail infrastructure in the five years from April 2024, Network Rail seems very reticent to place orders with its Tier 1 suppliers. As a result, the start to the current calendar year has been slower than that I would have wished. Nevertheless, the prospective order book across all three operating subsidiaries remains buoyant, and I am confident that the overall recovery will continue.\nThomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\")\nTED continues to see steady activity for request for quotes (\"RFQs\") in the UK for strategic equipment as contracts are slowly released from Network Rail. This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year.\nSome of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure.\nThe strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.\nThe respective regional Unipart sales teams are now tasked with following up those leads to bring them to fruition.\nPlans are now established also to exhibit TED's innovative products at the IAF Technology Show in Germany in May 2025, which is the largest exhibition for track technology in Europe, occurring only once every three years.\nWe believe that the proactive continuation of Unipart's global marketing initiatives will ensure that TED's products are embedded in future rail infrastructure projects around the world.\nThe Unipart rail attachment business remains stable with a regular monthly order intake, as sales relationships are firmly established around the world, including most recently in Australia, Canada, America and France.\nAdien\nJuly to December 2024 proved to be a positive period for Adien, off the back of strong activity from the sales team in the first six months of that year. In this regard, Adien was at 95%+ capacity during this half-year period. Much of this activity saw Adien mainly committed to the Scottish and Southern Electricity (\"SSE\") projects together with a healthy number of ",

Similarly, Adien Limited's unaudited revenues are also comfortably higher than the comparable period last year, and its committed order book is full through to spring next year. Finally, Utsi Electronics Limited's unaudited revenues are marginally better than the comparable period last year. However, that business continues to be adversely affected by the continuing political instability around the world.\nWe expect unaudited revenues for the six months ending 31 December 2024 (excluding QM Systems Ltd (\"QM\")) to be significantly ahead of the comparable period last year (H1 2023 revenues excluding QM: \u00a31.1 million). While QM's entry into administration is a contributing factor, the higher margins achievable from the demand that PipeHawk's broader group of companies is encountering as a result of better efficiency in utilisation of staff is anticipated to positively compensate. Accordingly, management expects this to result in the Group reporting a net breakeven consolidated result for the six months ending 31 December 2024.\nThe Board believes it is important to ensure that employees in the Group's businesses\u00a0are incentivised to enhance business performance leading to improvement in the share price of Pipehawk. With that in mind, the Board is preparing to grant new options over ordinary shares in Pipehawk.\nAs previously announced on 28 November 2024,\u00a0trading conditions in the UK and globally are very difficult for SMEs. This means that, while management remains optimistic that the performance of our businesses will continue to improve gradually over the coming months, this is taking longer than originally anticipated. However, the Board believes that the Group has positioned itself to take advantage of current market conditions and that it should therefore be less susceptible to the need for a resurgence of business confidence.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel.

Excluding QM\nSystems Ltd, the Group'\nloss before taxation\nand exceptional items for the financial year was \u00a30.27 million.\n-\nCautiously projecting a return to operating profitability in the current financial year ending 30 June 2025.\nI can report that the Group's t\nurnover (including QM Systems Ltd) for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 (the \"Financial Year\" or \"2023/24 FY\") increased to \u00a39.1 million (2023: \u00a36.5 million). The Group incurred an operating loss (including QM Systems Ltd) in the Financial Year of \u00a31,215,000 (2023: \u00a32,899,000), a loss before taxation and exceptional items (including QM Systems Ltd) for the Financial Year of \u00a31,639,000 (2023: loss \u00a33,284,000) and a loss after taxation and exceptional items (including QM Systems Ltd) of \u00a3821,000\n(2023: loss \u00a32,484\n,000\n).\nThe loss per share for the Financial Year was 2.26p (2023: loss per share 6.84p).\nIn July 2024, QM Systems Ltd (\"QM\"), a subsidiary of the Group, entered into administration. Accordingly, the board of directors of the Group (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") determined to treat impairment losses and gains related to QM as exceptional items in these accounts. Due to the impact of the QM administration the investments were written off in its entirety and suffered the appropriate qualification in the Group's audit report.\nExcluding QM Systems Ltd and focusing on the remaining group operations only, the Group's turnover for the Financial Year was \u00a32.9 million with an operating profit of \u00a30.12 million. Loss before taxation and exceptional items (excluding QM Systems Ltd) for the Financial Year was \u00a30.27 million.\nWell, that was an extremely challenging year!\nThere was cause for cautious optimism as we entered the Financial Year with a record orderbook across the Group's subsidiaries and throughout the Financial Year as quotes and interest in the Group's solutions were high. Unfortunately, the challenging political, economic and financial backdrop in the UK contributed to what the Board believes is an environment that is currently not supportive of a manufacturing economy. For example, based on feedback and discussions with prospective customers, the Board believed that QM's technical solutions were viewed as better and more cost effective than solutions that competitors could offer. However, in reality, weak business confidence amongst our target customer base meant that commitment of the necessary capital expenditure continued to be deferred. Similarly, whilst all three of QM's contract manufacturing lines were ready for production, certain of QM's contracted clients continually deferred start of production (\"SOP\") until they viewed business conditions to be more favourable, which failed to materialise during the Financial Year.\nAs a result, shortly following the end of the Financial Year, QM went into administration as orders continued to be deferred and two significant orders failed to materialise.\nOn a positive note, the other businesses in the Group service the utilities, government and rail industries. Our experience in these areas is that they are significantly less reliant on the confidence of private sector businesses to commit funds for major investments. Rather they are more driven by the demands of the public sector, where there has previously been major underinvestment, but which now appears to be progressing albeit it is still early days. Additionally, the Board anticipates that Thomson Engineering Design Ltd and Utsi Electronics Ltd will increasingly be servicing a global marketplace and will therefore be less affected by the UK's uncertain business environment. These businesses, including Adien Ltd, had a combined turnover of \u00a32,934,000 in the Financial Year (2023: \u00a32,284,000) and a pre-tax loss of \u00a3278,000 (2023: \u00a31,511,000). I am therefore cautiously projecting a return to operating profitability in the current financial year ending 30 June 2025 (\"Current Financial Year\").\nNotwithstanding the Board's confidence that the infrastructure sectors are the right business areas to be in, the economic and political environment in the UK clearly continues to be inimical to business in general and SMEs in particular, accordingly the directors have taken the decision to write off the entirety of the Group's cost of investment and goodwill in its subsidiaries in these accounts.\nQM Systems Ltd (\"QM\")\nThe Board believed that QM was on track to re",

As part of the terms and conditions of the CULS, it was agreed that the CULS may be converted, at the option of Gordon Watt, into new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company (the \"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") at a price of 7 pence per Ordinary Share at any time prior to 13 August 2014. In addition, the interest payable on the CULS was set at 10 per cent. per annum on the principal amount outstanding until converted, prepaid or repaid, calculated and compounded on each anniversary of the issue of the CULS. On conversion of any CULS, any unpaid interest would be paid within 20 days of such conversion with the CULS repayable together with accrued interest on 13 August 2014 (together, the \"\n2010 CULS\n\").\nOn 14 November 2014, the Company announced that it had extended the repayment date of the 2010 CULS from 13 August 2014 to 13 November 2018 and changed the conversion price of the 2010 CULS from 7 pence to 5 pence with all other terms of the 2010 CULS remaining unchanged (the \"\n2014 Amendments\n\").\nOn 9 November 2018, the Company announced that it had agreed to further extend the repayment date of the 2010 CULS from 13 November 2018 to 13 August 2022 with all other terms of the 2010 CULS remaining unchanged (the \"\n2018 Amendment\n\").\nThe issue of the 2010 CULS, the 2014 Amendments and the 2018 Amendment were respectively deemed to be related party transactions pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"\nAIM\nRules\n\") at the time. Accordingly, as disclosed in each respective announcement outlined above, the independent directors of the Company, having consulted the Company's nominated adviser at the time, concluded that the entry into the 2010 CULS, the 2014 Amendments and the 2018 Amendment to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\n2022 amendment to the CULS\nOn 29 November 2022, it was announced by the Company in its final results for the year ended 30 June 2022,\ninter alia\n, that on 30 June 2022 the Company further extended the repayment date of the 2010 CULS from 13 August 2022 to 13 August 2026, and otherwise on identical terms to the 2018 Amendment (the \"\n2022 Amendment\n\"), including the conversion price of 5 pence.\nIn this regard, the Company has recently become aware of a clerical error made in:\n(i) note 16 to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022 (announced by the Company on 29 November 2022);\n(ii) note 15 to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021(announced by the Company on 3 November 2021); and\n(iii) note 15 to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2020 (announced by the Company on 21 October 2020),\nall of which erroneously referred to a CULS conversion price of 3 pence. The same erroneous reference to a 3 pence CULS conversion price was repeated in the relevant notes to the Company's annual reports for the years ended 30 June 2020, 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020.\nThe Company can confirm that the CULS conversion price remains at 5 pence, noting that the 2022 Amendment was stated, in the announcement made by the Company at the time, to be on identical terms to the 2018 Amendment.\nThe entry by the Company into the 2022 Amendment, namely a further extension of the CULS repayment date to 13 August 2026, is deemed to be a related party transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13. However, the Company's nominated adviser, Allenby Capital, was not consulted at the time of entering into the 2022 Amendment. In this regard, the Company's current directors independent of the 2022 Amendment, being Robert MacDonnell and Timothy Williams, consider, having now consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Allenby Capital, that the terms of the 2022 Amendment are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel.

Notwithstanding this challenging environment, the board of directors of the Group (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") anticipated that QM would receive two material orders that were anticipated to underpin QM's financial performance and position. Contrary to the Board's expectations, it has now been made apparent to the Board that the two anticipated material orders will not be forthcoming.\nAs a result, QM's financial position is now under severe financial pressure. Accordingly, the Board is now taking steps to potentially,\ninter alia\n, place the Group's subsidiary, QM, into administration or a similar corporate insolvency process.\nWhile the above developments in relation to QM are disappointing, the Board is of the view that any steps taken to protect the interests of QM's creditors through,\ninter alia\n, placing QM into administration, will not impact\nPipeHawk\n's broader group of companies and the Board believes that the remainder of the Group will be able to continue to trade as a going concern. Trading within the Group's other key subsidiaries, being Thomson Engineering Design Ltd, Adien Ltd and Utsi Electronics Ltd, currently remains in line with management's expectations.\nFurther information on QM Systems Limited\nQM is a turnkey provider of automation, test and manufacturing systems to all industries, also known as a machine builder and also offers contract manufacturing services. For the financial year ended 30th June 2023, QM generated approximately \u00a34.2 million in revenues (representing approximately 65% of the Group's revenue for that year) and reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a3970k.

It was also announced that as part of the MoU there were no minimum sales required to be achieved to maintain this exclusive arrangement.\nMore recently, TED's partnership with Unipart Rail has further expanded beyond the distribution of TED's standard products to include the manufacture and distribution of TED's high output, self-propelled equipment.\nWith the above progress, the Company is pleased to report that whilst revenues at TED recognised in the year to 30 June 2023 under the MoU were only \u00a330k, the Company expects this to have increased to approximately \u00a30.5m in the year ending 30 June 2024, with a further \u00a3250k of revenue already booked for the year ending 30 June 2025.\nGordon Watt, Chairman of PipeHawk commented:\n\"While it has initially taken some time for orders to materialise under the MoU with Unipart Rail, we are pleased to note the recent uptake in orders which includes both an increase in value and frequency for both the attachments and high output machinery.\nOur expectation is that TED's partnership with Unipart Rail will provide a strong channel for growth in terms of revenue and profitability outside of the traditional TED work streams, which historically has predominantly been UK orders.\nIn addition to the MoU, TED and Unipart Rail have also recently won joint funding from Innovate UK, Global Centre of Rail Excellence for the development of Mobile Rail Panel Handler (the \"Project\"). This Project is well underway and will see the development and manufacture of very innovative solution for handling large rail panels.\nThe establishment of the latest Project between TED and Unipart Rail is leading to increases in orders for TED and is providing for some very innovative rail handling solutions that will soon be available to clients globally. I am personally really looking forward to seeing how this Project develops over the coming months.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel.

The Group's turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2023 was \u00a34,572,000 (December 2022: \u00a32,239,000), an increase of 104 per cent over the comparable period last year. The loss before taxation was \u00a3633,000 (H1 2022: loss of \u00a31,797,000) and the loss after taxation was \u00a3441,000 (H1 2022: loss \u00a31,440,000).\nAs indicated in my November Chairman's Statement accompanying the annual accounts for the year ended 30 June 2023, the Governor of the Bank of England has done a sterling job of dampening down demand with high interest rates which, coupled with various other uncertainties and head winds, has meant very few new orders have been placed during the period, with the notable exception of Adien, although enquiries and quotations have remained high.\nWe had worked hard to enter this six-month period with a record order book and have converted those orders into recognised turnover. However, without the steady flow of new orders coming in, our efficiency in utilisation of staff has been suboptimal.\nNevertheless, just in the last month, TED has received a record level of new orders and QM has been advised that a number of continually stalled orders will be placed within the next six weeks. Adien has turned its fortunes around very well and Utsi's new developments look well set to enter the market in the next financial year.\nAccordingly, we are cautiously optimistic that next year will be a return to good profitability where, after a two year \"hiccup\" in our financial plans, we will be able to take proper advantage of QM Systems' move to premises five times the size of its previous premises and TED's move to premises three times the size of its previous premises.\nQM Systems (\"QM\")\nQM's first six months have provided an insight into a market in recession. We have seen a reduction in the number of orders as well as value, but an increase in potential customers of significance. These potential customers are in innovative markets with the requirement for multiple machines across multiple production facilities within the UK and Europe. This provides us with confidence for the future as we form strategic partnerships in sustainable and innovative markets such as medical devices, assisted mobility and building services, amongst others. The downturn in orders is heavily linked to the limited access in lending facilities created by high interest rates and, as such, the projects have not been lost, but have simply been deferred until lending rates allow a more attractive investment opportunity. As a result, we currently sit on a pending sales pipeline in excess of \u00a39m across 12 projects which we believe have a high prospect of success. The total prospective sales pipeline for the next 12 months is in excess of \u00a320m.\nMaterial uncertainties for our customers have marginally improved on raw materials such as steel, oil, grain and lumber which is allowing these customers to switch their focus back onto production. In turn this is highlighting the issues they face surrounding staffing levels at mid to high volumes as a result of which we have seen an upturn in enquiry requests since the end of January 2024 as customers look towards increased automation.\nThe problems of the last few years have caused a major reassessment of clients' supply lines. Some have moved manufacturing to locations across Europe with cheaper labour and we have witnessed automotive clients in particular, looking to undertake this re-alignment over the past 12 months. However, the pandemic also illustrated the reliance the UK had on Chinese manufacturing and as such FMCG, MOD, building services and medical device manufacturers have increased their investment in the UK. Modular building services is also seeing a significant backing from the government as we move closer to their modular building target by 2026.\nThe first six months of the trading year have resulted in a loss. However, we have reduced the loss month on month despite supply chain and staffing issues. For example, manufacturers are increasingly using either a European hub or build to order processes, whereas historically they would be held in stock in the UK. This access to stock can impact project timings, with delays in excess of 4-6 weeks for bought out components. We have also had several local machining companies, as well as fabricators, feel the pinch of the recession and cease trading whilst holding orders for QM. Again, this has had an impact on project timings as we have had to estab",

The Group incurred an operating loss in the Financial Year of \u00a32,899,000 (2022: \u00a31,312,000), a loss before taxation for the Financial Year of \u00a33,284,000 (2022: loss \u00a31,576,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a32,484,000\n(2022: loss \u00a3868\n,000\n).\nThe loss per share for the financial year was 6.84p (2022: loss 2.42p).\nNotwithstanding the resurgence of our businesses over the last few months, due to delay in the Start of Production for the contract manufacturing business, and given the effects of the wider downturn and volatility in the global market uncertainty the directors have taken a prudent view to recognise a goodwill impairment charge totalling \u00a3678k.\nIt is evident now that the disappointing results delivered during the last two financial years were created over a single 12-month period spanning January 2022 through until December 2022. This was as a result of a perfect storm on the back of a faltering recovery from Covid, the Russian invasion of the Ukraine in February 2022 and the political chaos resulting from the resignation of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister in June 2022, an interregnum until the appointment, and brief term in office, of Liz Truss from September 2022 and finally the appointment of Rishi Sunak in late October 2022. All this set against a background of rising fuel prices and price rises on just about every other manufactured good, whilst the Bank of England \"helps\" to reduce demand even further by increasing UK interest rates most months whilst saying there is more pain to come! Somewhat surprisingly and despite the aforementioned factors, quotations within the Group's businesses over this period remained buoyant, evidencing the desire of clients to place orders once they felt confident that a degree of stability had materialised.\nThe first half of the financial year saw a slow start on sales at \u00a32.2 million, however the second half of the financial year saw this rise to \u00a34.3 million. This improvement has continued into the first few months of the current financial year as we anticipate being able to make full use of the much larger facilities which we moved into at QM and TED when the market place was looking much more positive two years ago.\nWe entered the current year with a Group orderbook in excess of \u00a36 million - the highest in our history, so, provided there are no more nasty surprises to upset the resurgence of stability and belief in our economy, I am confident the Group will be able to report a much-improved financial return at the end of the current financial year, with this improvement continuing thereafter.\nQM Systems\nFor the reasons outlined above, QM had a very tough year having only just moved to premises five times larger with consequent increased overhead costs. Nevertheless, unlike some of its competitors, it has weathered the storm and has come out stronger.\nSimilar to the previous 2021/22 financial year, QM experienced a year of two halves although this time in reverse. The 2022/23 financial year saw QM report a 36% increase in revenue to \u00a34.2m but with a significant loss after tax of \u00a3970k for the year. However, the loss was almost entirely created within the first six months where revenue was only \u00a31.3m with a loss after tax of \u00a3950k. The company steadily grew revenue throughout the second part of the year achieving a return to profit within the final quarter.\nTowards the end of the first quarter of the 2022/23 financial year, contract awards again began to flow into the business, and this accelerated through the latter part of 2022 and into 2023. Orders received during the period from September 2022 through to June 2023 exceeded \u00a37m and resulted in QM ending the 2022/23 financial year with its healthiest ever forward orderbook of \u00a35.8m. Many of these orders were quotations provided by QM 12-18 months prior, in some cases more.\nThe average size of order award for QM has increased to approximately \u00a3500k with a number of larger orders between \u00a31m to \u00a32m in value also being awarded. QM today sits in a competitive position for contracts with values above \u00a3300k. QM now has the infrastructure both in terms of resource and facilities to deliver large multi-million-pound contracts, and today sales generation is focused o",

          "full_content": "30 Mar 2023 07:00\nRNS Number : 7004U\nPipeHawk PLC\n30 March 2023\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU EXIT) Regulations 2019/310.\n30 March 2023\nPipeHawk plc\n(\"PipeHawk\" or the \"Company\")\nUnaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2022\nChairman's Statement\nThe Company's turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2022 was \u00a32,239,000 (December 2021: \u00a33,247,000), a reduction of 28 per cent over the comparable period last year, resulting in a loss before taxation of \u00a31,797,000 (2021: loss of \u00a3457,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a31,440,000 (2021: loss \u00a3284,000).\nAs indicated in my November Chairman's Statement accompanying the annual accounts for the year ended 30 June 2022, the challenges faced within the first half of 2022 calendar year continued further into the second half of 2022 than originally expected resulting in a significant drop in turnover compared with the six months to 31 December 2021 and an accompanying significant pre-tax loss for the six months ended 31 December 2022. War in Ukraine, fuel cost spikes, interest rate rises, three UK Prime Ministers - all are contributing factors for delays that a number of the group businesses have faced in receiving contract awards from clients. It has been very challenging to manage resource levels across the group where we have protected staffing levels to be able to switch on quickly where contract award appeared imminent. Nevertheless, also as previously reported, Rishi Sunak introduced a degree of confidence into the marketplace which appears to have provided a level of confidence for our clients to again start to award contracts and work started to flow in the later part of 2022. This appears to be accelerating into the start of 2023 with several contacts being awarded, with the result that we have recruited significant additional staff in order to be able to cope with the current and anticipated workload. It now appears that the move by QM Systems to premises five times the size of its previous premises and TED to premises three times the size of its previous premises was well judged and both premises are nearing a far more satisfactory level of occupation. Orderbooks are healthy, time charged and revenue recognised from existing projects is greatly improved and order pipeline appears healthy.\nThe Directors of PipeHawk therefore believe that the outlook does look very positive for the remainder of this year and beyond.\nQM Systems (\"QM\")\nAs reported in the accounts for the year ended 30 June 2022 (the \"2021/22 FY\"), QM witnessed an order intake that was significantly below management expectations. Whilst quotations and the expected orderbook through the latter part of 2021/22 FY increased dramatically, the gestation period from quotation to order placement remained protracted as our clients continued to grapple with the material uncertainties within their markets created initially by Covid-19 and then aggravated further by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In 2021/22 FY, we reported that order intake had increased significantly in the first four months of this current financial year. In this regard, I am pleased to say that this trend has continued with a number of projects moving forward from a protracted quotation phase to order placement. New orders received this financial year up to 29 March 2023 stood at over \u00a35.8M. Quotation activity remains buoyant and we have a significant expected orderbook that we are confident in converting to orders during this [financial year], providing fuel for further growth at QM.\nTimescales for projects over the last 18 months have increased significantly, predominantly due to extended timescales surrounding material and component availability. This hampers our ability to generate revenue at a quicker rate as we experience longer periods of waiting time for materials to be delivered following the release from the design phase. Consequently, the effects of increases in order intake to positively ripple through all areas of our business is longer than that ordinarily anticipated. In addition, given the reduced orderbook in 2021/22 FY we had reduced staffing levels to accommodate the workload at that time. This workforce reduction has further impacted our ability to realise revenue quickly, particularly in being able to respond to sudden and significant increases in order placement. The result of the aforementioned conditions has contributed to the reduction in revenue in the first part of the 2022/23 FY and this is reflected in the figures published.\nWe are however pleased to report that material and component delivery times are improving and we have recruited a number of additional mechanical, electrical and software engineers for both our engineering and manufacturing teams. Since 30 June 2022, the QM workforce has increased from 44 to 55 despite recruitment of high calibre engineers",

I am pleased to report that the order intake for the year to date stands at a healthy \u00a34.3 million and this does not include the carried forward order book at the beginning of the current FY, which stood at \u00a32.5 million. QM Systems also has a strong order pipeline which is most encouraging for the remainder of the current financial year.\nI am also pleased to report that QM Systems has signed a further contract manufacturing agreement with Fast MDx, a UK-based molecular diagnostics company, to deliver a semi-automated low\n\u2011\ncost, high\n\u2011\nthroughput, near-patient Molecular Diagnostic Test System. This agreement covers the pilot phase and will involve the design and manufacture of the system and the filling of vials on behalf of the customer at the Hartlebury premises. This is an interesting early-stage project and while revenues will not be material at this stage, QM Systems hopes that this will lead to a larger contract in due course.\nI can also report that the memorandum of understanding signed by Thomson Engineering Design Limited (\"TED\") with Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart Rail\") for Unipart Rail to be the exclusive partner for sales and distribution of TED rail equipment into territories in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, Australia and the Americas has now been signed as a contract.\nTED has also recently started to do small scale contract manufacturing for a long-established supplier to the Rail Industry to conduct a small number of mule conversions, with the expectation that this will lead to Toyota Hilux conversions in H2 of the current FY. TED intends to develop this area of its business by developing partnerships outside the rail sector.\nA presentation on QM Systems and TED will be made after the AGM has been held and this will be made available on the Company's website (\nwww.pipehawk.com\n)\nshortly thereafter.\"\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel.

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n29 November 2022\nPipeHawk plc\n(\"PipeHawk\", \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nFinal Results for the year ended 30 June 2022\nHighlights\n- Turnover of \u00a36.2 million, a decrease of 7.5% (2021: \u00a36.7 million)\n- Loss before taxation for the financial year of \u00a31,576,000 (2021: profit \u00a379,000)\n- QM Systems completed a move into a modern and far larger facility on the Hartlebury Trading Estate, providing approx. 200% more office space and 600% more manufacturing capacity\n- TED has moved into a significantly larger premises and since the financial year end has signed a global distribution memorandum of understanding with Unipart Rail Limited\nThe Group reported an operating loss in the year ended 30 June 2022 (the \"financial year\" and the \"2021/22 FY\") of \u00a31,312,000 (2021: \u00a3257,000), a loss before taxation for the financial year of \u00a31,576,000 (2021: profit \u00a379,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a3868,000\n(2021: profit \u00a3\n522,000\n). T\nurnover for the financial year reduced to \u00a36.2million (2021: \u00a36.7 million)\n.\nThe loss per share for the financial year was 2.42p (2021: profit 1.50p).\nIn line with the outlook expressed in my Chairman's Statement last year, like others in the industry, we have been faced with difficult market conditions this financial year. As outlined on 24 March 2022 in the Group's unaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2021 this has been an extremely challenging year. Just when we thought we were getting over the vicissitudes of the Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic with its consequent delays caused by material shortages, extended lead times and increased costs, all suffered without the furlough buffer - then Russia invades the Ukraine, fuel costs soar and suddenly the world realises that energy is the key to our standard of living and economic livelihood at all levels.\nAs a consequence, the Group continued to see decisions across all levels of the chain be deferred and/or delayed throughout the financial year. The impact of the delay in receiving contract decisions continued to impact the Group right up to late September 2022. However, following September 2022, the Group has seen a number of larger orders that have previously been in abeyance for several months placed. In addition, the Group notes a shift in market sentiment, namely, that there appears to be a general willingness to actively re-engage and commit to forward-looking business decisions (as opposed to remaining in tick-over mode).\nDespite the disappointing results for the financial year, the directors believe, for the reasons outlined above, that this merely represents a temporary blip in our growth trajectory. Notwithstanding this result, this financial year has been critical for the Group as seen by our underlying positive direction of travel. In addition, we have invested significantly to be able to take advantage of the opportunities evident from our groundwork. Not only have we expanded Thomson Engineering Design's (\"TED\") footprint fourfold (we have decided to retain, and rebuild its original premises whilst retaining its new premises, as we foresee the need for further growth), QM Systems Limited (\"QM\") footprint has increased fivefold, and a new line to QM business, contract manufacturing, has been established. Lastly, Adien is now fully engaged in 5G work and the integration of Utsi and PipeHawk's technology bodes well for the future.\nI am confident therefore that the future looks very promising.\nQM Systems\nQM Systems has completed a challenging financial year where for a large part of that time the orderbook has been significantly below management expectation. This trend continued longer than expected into the 2021/22 FY resulting in the inability of QM Systems to pull through the expected level of revenue and profit. It does seem as though the effect of the pandemic eventually rippled through QM Systems later than initially anticipated. In addition, following Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, decision makers decided to defer making capital commitments, which manifested into expected orders being delayed by several months.\nDuring the second half of the financial year, QM Systems completed a move into a modern and far larger facility on the Hartlebury Trading Estate. The move expands the available facilities from approximately 8,000 sq ft to approximately 45,000 sq ft; providing approx. 200% more office space and 600% more manufacturing capacity. The move was required to facilitate not only the anticipated growth in the company's project business but also the housing of the newly established contract manu",

Whilst securing of this additional funding has inevitably caused delay to the product release, the funding enables Ventive to complete the development of the initial product variants and, in partnership with QM, complete the manufacturing facility ready for product release in Q4 2023.\nThe Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) awarded \u00a31.5m in funding to Ventive as part of its Heat Pump Ready grant. In addition, an investment package has been secured by Ventive, led by the deep tech and venture capital specialist, EMV Capital, which includes an initial equity and debt investment of \u00a3600,000 from new investors including EMV Capital. The package also includes the restructuring of c. \u00a31m of historical debt in Ventive. EMV Capital is a subsidiary of AIM-quoted NetScientific PLC.\nVentive's modular exhaust air heat pumps are targeted at both new build and retrofit applications and will provide significant cost and carbon dioxide emissions reductions across their installation, operation, and production.\nGordon Watt, Chairman of PipeHawk plc commented:\n\"It is testament to Ventive, the product and its strong partnership with QM that it has been able to attract the additional funding required from a combination of sources including the BEIS Heat Pump Ready grant scheme and a wider circle of green industry focused investors.

Major contract with Ventive Limited\nPipeHawk provides the following update in relation to the contract entered into between QM Systems Limited (\"QM\"), one of the Group's principal subsidiaries, and Ventive Limited (\"Ventive\") announced on 10 March 2022.\nIn order to meet production deliverables associated with the \"Ventive Home\" System,\nVentive needed to raise additional development capital. Pipehawk understands that Ventive is at an advanced stage of discussions to secure such funding.\nThe receipt of the additional development capital by Ventive has taken longer than originally anticipated. As a result, production of the\n\"Ventive Home\" System, which was scheduled to begin in June 2022, is now expected to commence in September 2023, with the product coming to\nmarket in the fourth quarter of 2023. As a consequence, revenues for QM associated with contract manufacturing of the \"Ventive Home\" System, which were expected to occur in the year ending 30 June 2023, are now expected to accrue in the subsequent financial year\n.\nQM continues to expect to receive revenue in connection with the building of the \"Ventive Home\" System production line within the year ending 30 June 2023.\nGordon Watt, Chairman of PipeHawk plc commented:\n\"While I am disappointed that the timing of production has been delayed for this project which has delayed the commencement of revenue for PipeHawk, I do recognise the challenges faced when bringing new and innovative disruptive technology to market. As a business, we thrive on being at the forefront of technological development, in particular where that technology has the capacity to have positive impact on our world. I look forward to Ventive securing the additional development capital and working with Ventive to bring this innovative and exciting product to market\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk Plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel.

          "full_content": "24 Mar 2022 07:00\nRNS Number : 8203F\nPipeHawk PLC\n24 March 2022\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU EXIT) Regulations 2019/310.\n24 March 2022\nPipeHawk plc\n(\"PipeHawk\" or the \"Company\")\nUnaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2021\nChairman's Statement\nI am pleased to report that the Company's turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2021 was \u00a33,247,000 (2020: \u00a32,641,000), an increase of 23 per cent over the comparable period last year, resulting in a loss before taxation of \u00a3457,000 (2020: loss of \u00a3336,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a3284,000 (2020: \u00a3161,000)\nThis has been an extremely challenging six months following the removal of the UK government furlough support coupled with employee absences as a result of ongoing variants of COVID-19, delays caused by material shortages, much longer supply lead times and increased costs, all of which have caused operational inefficiencies and uncertainty with existing and potential clients such that expected orders have been delayed or deferred. Nevertheless, the underlying direction of travel of our business is clear. We have accelerated progress at both QM Systems Limited (\"QM Systems\") and Thomson Engineering Design Limited (\"TED\") and have now moved both operations to a state of the art premises five times and three times respectively greater than their previous footprint. This, and the level of interest evidenced by our current sales discussions, positions the Company very well for the future.\nQM Systems\nOrder intake for the initial six months ended 31 December 2021 was below management expectations. This is predominantly the result of anticipated projects being delayed rather than projects being cancelled or lost. In addition, the operational team continues to be kept busy on project work as the dramatic effects of the earlier COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns has continued to affect the business into the later stages of project lifecycle for longer than anticipated. This has meant that balancing the various team workloads has become increasingly difficult compared to previous periods.\nSince the beginning of 2022, QM Systems orderbook and order prospects have improved, and it is anticipated that during the later stages of the current financial year the QM Systems orderbook will result in production being at full capacity. During the last few weeks our quotation levels and degree of engagement have increased significantly with a number of projects expected to start within the next one or two months.\nOver the first six months ended 31 December 2021, we secured two contract manufacturing contracts for completely different products. The first contract will see QM Systems produce a product for the marine market and the second contract concerns a partnership with Ventive Limited (\"Ventive\") to design and subsequently manufacture an innovative, new technology home heating and hot water system that is expected to replace conventional Gas and Oil fired heating and hot water systems with a far more sustainable solution.\nIn order to enable QM Systems to reach the targeted start of production dates for the above two manufacturing contracts of mid-2022 and late-2022, respectively, QM Systems has relocated to a far larger premises a few minutes away from its previous location. QM Systems has made significant investment into the new facility to provide a 'state of the art' manufacturing facility that our partners and QM Systems can be proud of. Despite the challenging timescales QM Systems managed to complete the move within two months from signing of the contracts and QM Systems is now up and running in the new facility. Inevitably the disruption created through moving an entire operation to a new location will impact our third quarter. However, we have kept disruption to a minimum through careful planning and ensuring that our manufacturing operations suffered minimal down time.\nIn the second half of the current financial year QM Systems expects to continue to deliver its bespoke projects for assembly and test systems to its existing and new clients as well as continued preparations for the start of manufacturing the 'Ventive Home' system at the end of June 2022.\nThomson Engineering Design (\"TED\")\nBusiness has continued to be relatively buoyant at TED as it continues to remain largely immune to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically a pattern had emerged where the orderbook at TED had been light during the first quarter of each new financial year and subsequently growing in the mid to later stages of the second quarter of the financial year. The effort that has been put into marketing, promoting and developing TED's business into further international markets and with new clients this year has enabled TED to continue the momentum and traction gained in the second part of the previous 2020/21 financial year into the first half",

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.  All said, I don't see why the Mkt cap cannot reach 5mln in 2-3 years.  GLA!",

Unipart has already dedicated a special section on its website for this TED product, so one expects that it's already heavily promoting it globally.

          "content": "Thomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\") As mentioned in my Chairman's statement last year, Network Rail's CP6 funding round ended in March 2024 and the new round, CP7, started in April 2024. Network Rail has announced that it has a budget spend of \u00a344 billion over the next five years so there is now a degree of budget certainty amongst suppliers and contractors to Network Rail. As a result, TED's business was slow at the start of the Financial Year up to the point that CP6 finished, but UK orders picked up significantly in the last quarter of the Financial Year at the start of CP7, and have continued into the first quarter of the Current Financial Year. We expect this growth to continue for the next four years as Network Rail looks for innovative solutions to make the most cost-effective use of its budget in maintaining and upgrading the UK's rail infrastructure, both for work on Network Rail's infrastructure and for Eurotunnel. The TED and Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") partnership continues to strengthen as Unipart gains market presence in the rest of the world selling 'Yellow Plant', having exhibited at many shows around the world. The partnership has now received orders from Australia, France, Germany and North America, where large infrastructure projects continue to come to fruition. In addition, the respective regional Unipart sales teams are working hard to ensure that the TED name is embedded in future infrastructure projects enabling the pipeline to continue. Since the memorandum of understanding (the \"MoU\") was signed with Unipart in September 2022, the total value of orders received from Unipart Rails now in excess of \u00a31 million. The above developments in the UK market and the global market are seen as very positive for TED over the next few years.",

My letter of support dated 26 November 2023 was renewed on 20 November 2024 to provide the Group with financial support until 31 December 2025. Loans due to me, other than those covered by the CULS (as defined below) agreement, are unsecured and accrue interest at an annual rate of Bank of England base rate plus 2.15%. These include the further loans provided by me to the Group to provide QM Systems with the time needed to land the substantial new orders it was anticipating, which unfortunately failed to materialise. The Group's \u00a31.0 million convertible unsecured loan stock issued to me (the \"CULS\") was renewed on 30 June 2022 and extended on identical terms, such that the CULS are now repayable on 13 August 2026. Further details of the CULS were most recently announced by the Group on 26 September 2024. In addition to the loans I have provided to the Company in previous years, I have deferred a certain proportion of fees and the interest due on loans I have provided until the Company is in a suitably strong position to make the full payments.  During the Financial Year, the deferred element of fees and interest amounted to \u00a3252,000 and the aggregate amount of deferred fees and interest outstanding to me as at the end of the Financial Year amounted to approximately \u00a32.0 million in total, all of which has been recognised as a liability in the Company's accounts.",

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.  All said, I don't see why the Mkt cap cannot reach 5mln in 2-3 years.  GLA!",

Unipart has already dedicated a special section on its website for this TED product, so one expects that it's already heavily promoting it globally.

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

Unipart has already dedicated a special section on its website for this TED product, so one expects that it's already heavily promoting it globally. Obviously, many PIs got \"burnt\" last July but, at this SP level and the - IMO - expected turnaround in Revenues and CFlow, the upside far exceeds any downside risk. DYOR",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.  All said, I don't see why the Mkt cap cannot reach 5mln in 2-3 years.  GLA!",

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too.

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.

          "content": "80 leads generated since last Sept , so hopefully should hear some of these soon, now the seller is out earlier in 2025 it might be prudent for adding to my investment here Thomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\") TED continues to see steady activity for request for quotes (\"RFQs\") in the UK for strategic equipment as contracts are slowly released from Network Rail. This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",

Unipart has already dedicated a special section on its website for this TED product, so one expects that it's already heavily promoting it globally. Obviously, many PIs got \"burnt\" last July but, at this SP level and the - IMO - expected turnaround in Revenues and CFlow, the upside far exceeds any downside risk. DYOR",

As some here say, the SP was crashed due to bankruptcy concerns but the Board owns 40+% of the stock, new Share Options were given to Senior Mgt and the distribution arrangement with Unipart Rail seems to be going from strength to strength; another factor not discussed here is the heavy investment in infrastructure spending (rail, transport, defence) in the EU thanks to Vladimir and the Donald. Europe is gearing up to be ready for quick, heavy use of rail for defence preparation, this is bound to increase demand for TED's products, plus the other subs. too. IMO Once oper. profits start shooting up (given the appx 50% GMargins), then the debt owed to the Chairman will also start dropping.  All said, I don't see why the Mkt cap cannot reach 5mln in 2-3 years.  GLA!",

This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year. Some of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure. The strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.",
