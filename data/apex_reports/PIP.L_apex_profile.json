The Group reported an operating profit in the Financial Year of \u00a3118,000 (2024: loss \u00a31,215,000), a loss before taxation for the Financial Year of \u00a3310,000 (2024: loss \u00a31,639,000) and a loss after taxation of \u00a3259,000 (2024: loss \u00a3821,000). The loss per share for the Financial Year was 0.71p (2024: loss per share 2.26p).\nWell, that was another very challenging year! Obviously, there were repercussions and fall out from the demise of QM Systems, but the remaining teams and businesses have buckled down and grown remaining core turnover by 27% from \u00a32.9 million to \u00a33.7 million and I am confident that we shall continue to grow and will have soon clawed our way back to profitability, indeed on an EBITDA basis this year was positive to the tune of \u00a3207,000.\nWhilst I was cautiously optimistic this time last year that our core businesses were in the right industries which would be less affected by private sector lack of confidence because they service the utilities, government and rail industries, it sadly transpires that either funding has been cut or delayed or, where it has been made available, there is significant indecision on where and how to spend it. Accordingly, we are increasingly looking to overseas markets to sell our products and expertise. This bodes well for the future but does involve longer gestation periods.\nFinally, I would like to pay tribute to all of our staff, subsidiary board directors and main board directors for all their hard work and loyalty as we strive to achieve further progress at each of our businesses. In particular, I salute Randal MacDonnell, PipeHawk's highly respected and valued non-executive director who sadly passed away in September, and whose advice, tenacity and good humour will be sorely missed. We intend to appoint an additional non-executive director to the Board in due course.\nThomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\")\nTED finished the year on a high, increasing its turnover from \u00a31.14 million to \u00a31.77 million, growth of over 55% compared to 2024. This resulted in a healthy post-tax profit of \u00a3156k (2024: loss \u00a3104k).\nThe partnership between TED and Unipart continues to flourish, with the additional exposure and sales network Unipart brings to the partnership through marketing strategies and exhibitions combined with TED's newly developed High Output machinery and our other rail attachment offerings.\nExhibiting at the IAF exhibition show in Munster, Germany in May 2025 gained a high footfall of potential clients with serious interest in our rail equipment. Major interest is coming predominantly from Brazil, North America and India, and the machine methodology is being embedded into high profile infrastructure projects due to come to fruition in 2026.\nTED also showcased its rail attachments and special purpose machinery at the UK's largest rail event, Rail Live in June this year.\nThis led to sales leads and requests for quotes (\"RFQs\") of over \u00a3500k, some of which are now entering our order book destined for maintenance work on the London Underground Rail Network.\nTransport for London and the London Underground have approved TED machinery to be utilised for on-going and future maintenance projects.\nThe release of CP7 contracts to UK rail infrastructure for tier 1 and 2 contractors remains cautious and therefore our clients spend is being withheld until they are guaranteed the work bank. However, RFQs remain steady even though the gestation period for some RFQs is slow but seems to be gathering momentum as renewals and maintenance projects are released and confidence returns.\nThe outlook for 2026 and beyond is very positive.\nAdien Ltd (\"Adien\")\nThe last financial year for Adien proved to be positive overall. The Adien staff have settled well into their new premises and have managed to make a number of efficiencies as a result.\nAdien had a very strong start to the financial year with all teams at full occupation throughout almost the whole six-month period. Unfortunately, the second half of the year proved more difficult, with one very large infrastructure project which had been scheduled to start in mid-January getting progressively delayed until the end of spring. Adien had gone to great lengths in planning and accommodating the project only for the proposed start day to be delayed by three months. It then proved difficult to get full utilisation out of the teams during that three-month period at very short notice. Structural changes have been put in place to minimise the likelihood of such instances occurring moving forward and, in the unlikely event that they do, to mitigate their impact.\nThe project pipeline in 2025 has become somewhat difficult to navigate as a number of sectors that were expecting to see reasonable growth indicated that there will be little to no spend in 2025 and 2026. This primarily relates to anything MOD and local council related. MOD has shelved virtually all plans regarding barracks development/expansion or refurbishment. Likewise, there were several plans in relation to town/city centre regeneration projects which have also been shelved fully. There appears to be a lot of uncertainty and lack of commitment within the construction industry as a whole currently.\nHowever, on the positive side, Adien is doing well within the Telecoms, Water and Power industries with reasonable year on year growth. This is where we will continue our focus. Orders are strong here and have provided us with a nearly complete programme of works until the end of the calendar year. Coupled with our new CCTV division, it is anticipated that Adien will see good growth in the next year.\nUtsi Electronics Ltd (\"Utsi\")\nDespite global events stretching both customer relationships and supply chain timescales, throughout the year, as well as disrupting access to some regional markets, our plan for growth has continued to deliver tangible results, with turnover up over 30%, for the second year in succession, now bringing our bottom line within touching distance of being positive. While UK market sales have remained flat, sales to EU and ROW have been buoyant in comparison. As we have continued to re-establish ourselves within existing markets, we have also expanded the boundaries of our expertise into adjacent technologies, creating new opportunities for sideward growth. Our fostering of deeper relationships with our distribution chain; based on the prospect of mutual innovation - mutual growth, has also begun to open new doors, to work with international distributors, operating in allied fields, to provide additional customer specific requirements. While the timely sourcing of materials remains a concern. The future for Utsi continues to be bright and full of promise.\nFinancial position\nThe Group continues to be in a net liability position and is still reliant on my continuing financial support.\nMy letter of support dated 26 November 2023 was renewed on 16 November 2025 to provide the Group with financial support until 31 December 2026. Loans due to me, other than those covered by the CULS (as defined below) agreement, are unsecured and accrue interest at an annual rate of Bank of England base rate plus 2.15%.\nThe Group's \u00a31.0 million convertible unsecured loan stock issued to me (the \"CULS\") was renewed on 30 June 2022 and extended on identical terms, such that the CULS are now repayable on 13 August 2026. Further details of the CULS were most recently announced by the Group on 26 September 2024.\nIn addition to the loans I have provided to the Company in previous years, I have deferred a certain proportion of fees and the interest due on loans I have provided until the Company is in a suitably strong position to make the full payments. During the Financial Year, the deferred element of fees and interest amounted to \u00a3259,000 and the aggregate amount of deferred fees and interest outstanding to me as at the end of the Financial Year amounted to approximately \u00a32.0 million in total, all of which has been recognised as a liability in the Company's accounts.\nStrategy & Outlook\nThe Group remains committed to creating sustainable earnings-based growth and focusing on the expansion of its business with forward-looking products and services. PipeHawk acts responsibly towards its shareholders, business partners, employees, society and the environment in each of its business areas.\nPipeHawk is committed to technologies and products that unite the goals of customer value and sustainable development. Despite wider current market conditions, all divisions of the Group are currently performing well, and I remain optimistic in my outlook for the Group.\nGordon Watt\nExecutive Chairman\nDate: 24 November 2025\nIndependent auditor's report for the year ended 30 June 2025\n\"Opinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of PipeHawk Plc (the \"Parent Company\") and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") for the year ended 30 June 2025 which comprise:\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of financial position and Parent company statement of financial position\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of cash flow and Parent company statement of cash flow\n\u2022 Consolidated statement of changes in equity and Parent company statement of changes in equity and\n\u2022 the Notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\n\u2022 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's affairs as at 30 June 2025 and of its loss for the year then ended.\n\u2022 have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards; and\n\u2022 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that due to the financial requirements of the Group and the Parent Company, the Executive Chairman, G.G. Watt, will provide ongoing financial support for a period of at least twelve months from the approval date of the financial statements. These events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u2022 The information given in the strategic report and the report of the directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u2022 The strategic report and the report of the directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u2022 adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u2022 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u2022 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u2022 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 12, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\nOur approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:\n\u2022 we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the computer component manufacturing and supply sector;\n\u2022 we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006 and taxation legislation;\n\u2022 we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of management and inspecting legal correspondence; and\n\u2022 identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:\n\u2022 making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and\n\u2022 considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.\nTo address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:\n\u2022 performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;\n\u2022 tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions; and\n\u2022 investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.\nIn response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which included, but were not limited to:\n\u2022 agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;\n\u2022 reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;\n\u2022 enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.\nThere are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.\nA further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nMaterial misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve deliberate concealment or collusion.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

General information\nPipeHawk plc (the \"Company\" or the \"Group\") is a public limited company incorporated in the England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The addresses of its registered office and principal place of business are disclosed in the company information section on page 1. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) are described on page 7.\nThe financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of all companies in the Group. In accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate statement of comprehensive income for the parent Company has not been presented.\n1.2. Basis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (IAS) The principal accounting policies are set out below.\nAdoption of new and revised standards\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and, in some cases, have not yet been adopted by the UK. The directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company and Group in future periods.\n1.3. Basis of preparation - Going concern\nThe directors have reviewed the Parent Company and Group's funding requirements for the next twelve months which show positive anticipated cash flow generation, prior to any repayment of loans advanced by the Executive Chairman. The preparation of cash flow forecasts for the Group requires estimates to be made of the quantum and timing of cash receipts from future commercial revenues and the timing of future expenditure. The board consider that\nthe challenging political, economic and financial backdrop in the UK presents uncertainties for the group to achieve its revenue growth forecasts\n. The directors have obtained a renewed pledge from G G Watt to provide ongoing financial support including additional funding if required for a period of at least twelve months from the approval date of the Group and Parent Company statement of financial positions. The directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the entity has adequate resources to continue in its operational exercises for the foreseeable future. It is on this basis that the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of preparation within these financial statements. However, a material uncertainty exists regarding the ability of the Group and Parent Company to remain a going concern without the continuing financial support of the Executive Chairman.\nThe financial statement does not include adjustments which would arise in the event of not being a going concern.\n1.4. Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n1.5. Business combinations\nAcquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations.\nGoodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.\n1.6. Goodwill\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.\nIf the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\nOn disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n1.7. Revenue recognition\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services are recognised as control transfers to the customer in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 as follows:\nIdentify the contract with the customer\nA legally enforceable contract is entered into with a customer for the construction of a piece of equipment, or for the design and preparation of complete software and hardware test solutions and the provision of specialist surveying.\nIdentify the performance obligation\nThe performance obligation for the sale of goods is the construction and delivery of the specified equipment as per the contractual agreement and is satisfied over time as the work progresses.\nThe performance obligation for the sale of services is the design and preparation of complete software and hardware test solutions and the provision of specialist surveying as per the contractual agreement and is satisfied over time as the work progresses and control transfers to the customer.\nDetermine transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company expected to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised equipment to the customer. This includes fixed contract prices, and where applicable, estimated variable consideration, which is only included to the extent that it is highly probably that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\nAllocate the transaction price\nA revenue contract contains a single performance obligation with no separately satisfiable obligations. Therefore, the contract value is the transaction price.\nRecognise revenue\nRevenue is recognised over time as control passes to the customer. Revenue invoices are raised to the customer on a stage of completion basis, or on shorter term projects invoices are issued on completion. Where this results in a timing difference between revenue invoiced and revenue allowed a resulting contract asset or contract liability is recognised on the balance sheet.\nContract asset: When the company has incurred actual direct costs beyond the point of which revenue invoices have been raised, a contract asset is recognised for the amount of actual direct costs in excess of total revenue invoices raised.\nContract liabilities: When the company has invoiced the customer at a stage of completion beyond the point of which actual direct costs have been incurred, a contract liability is recognised for the amount which aggregate revenue invoices raised exceeds the amount of actual direct costs incurred.\n1.8. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty is valued on a fair value basis, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Assets held under leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nThe principal annual rates used to depreciate property, plant and equipment are:\nFreehold land and buildings 1% / 2%\nEquipment, fixtures and fittings 20% / 25%\nMotor vehicles 25%\n1.9. Inventories and work in progress\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs, including an appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead expenses, are assigned to inventories by the method most appropriate to the particular class of inventory, with the majority being valued on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\nWork in progress is valued at cost, which includes expenses incurred on behalf of clients and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable costs on incomplete assignments. The value of work in progress is reduced where appropriate to provide for irrecoverable costs\n.\n1.10. Financial assets\nThe Group's financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The Group's accounting policy for each category of financial asset is as follows:\nFinancial assets held at amortised cost\nTrade receivables and other receivables are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.\nImpairment provisions are recognised based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.\nThe Group's financial assets held at amortised cost comprise other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\nEquity instruments\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n1.11. Leased/Right of Use assets\nThe leases liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the individual entities incremental borrowing rate. The lease term comprises the non-cancellable period of the contract, together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option based on operational needs and contractual terms. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, and reducing it by the lease payments made. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option.\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs. Subsequently, right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liability.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease. The Group has elected to apply exemptions for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. For these leases, payments are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Right-of-use assets are presented within non-current assets on the face of the statement of financial position, and lease liabilities are shown separately on the statement of financial position in current liabilities and non-current liabilities depending on the maturity of the lease payments.\nUnder IFRS16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets.\nPayments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.\n1.12. Pension scheme contributions\nPension contributions are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they fall due. All pension costs are in relation to defined contribution schemes.\n1.13. Share based payments\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 18.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each statement of financial position date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.\n1.14. Foreign currencies\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 30 June. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transactions, and processed through the profit & loss account.\n1.15. Taxation\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nCurrent and deferred tax for the year\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the statement of comprehensive income, except when they relate to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity.\n1.16. Impairment of property, plant and equipment\nAt each year end date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable\namount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n1.17. Research and development\nThe Group undertakes research and development to expand its activity in technology and innovation to develop new products that will begin directly generating revenue in the future. Expenditure on research is expensed as incurred, development expenditure is capitalised only if the criteria for capitalisation are recognised in IAS 38. The Company claims tax credits on its research and development activity and recognises the income in current tax.\n1.18. Government grants\nDuring the period, the Group received benefits from Government grants totalling \u00a3 nil (2024: 18,000).\n1.19. Critical judgement in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the directors have made in the process of applying the entity's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financial statements.\nThe estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nCritical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies\nThe following are the critical judgement/s, apart from those involving estimations that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nPipeHawk consolidated accounts operate under IFRS 15 which adopts the following approach to recognising revenue.\nRevenue on long-term projects is recognised on the percentage of completion method (unless a loss is forecast on that project), they state the significant risks and rewards are transferred and that the recognition of revenue over the duration of a contract is appropriate as enforceable contracts are in place.\nEach project is customer specific and has an enforceable contract. Throughout the project each project is assessed individually by the management to ascertain the percentage of revenue recognised and this is continually updated throughout the project. As each project is specific to customer and we can enforce the contract, we have applied percentage complete basis at year end rather than transfer of significant risks and rewards basis of ownership. The directors are satisfied that percentage completion remains the appropriate critical judgement.\nKey source of estimation uncertainty\nThe key assumption concerning estimation at the balance sheet date, with a risk of causing any adjustment to carrying amounts in the assets and liabilities within the next financial year, would be in relation to the valuations of the properties owned by the group.\nThe management believe the current estimates are accurate based on revaluation and are now more in line with their true value. The buildings are an integral part of the businesses future as going concerns, and there is currently no plan to sell, so therefore the risk is not deemed as significant.\nGoing concern\nThe preparation of cash flow forecasts for the Group requires estimates to be made of the quantum and timing of cash receipts from future commercial revenues and the timing of future expenditure, all of which are subject to uncertainty, see Basis of preparation - Going concern note 1.3\n2 Segmental analysis\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nTurnover by geographical market\nUnited Kingdom\n3,296\n8,739\nEurope\n49\n82\nOther\n398\n317\n3,743\n9,138\nThe Group operates out of one geographical location being the UK. Accordingly, the primary segmental disclosure is based on activity. Per IFRS 8 operating segments are based on internal reports about components of the Group, which are regularly reviewed and used by Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), the current executive chairman, for strategic decision making and resource allocation, in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. The Group's reportable operating segments are as follows\n:\n\u00b7\nAdien Limited - Utility detection and mapping services - Sale of services\n\u00b7\nUtsi Electronics Limited - Development, assembly and sale of GPR equipment - Sale of goods\n\u00b7\nThomson Engineering Design Limited - Rail trackside solutions (included in the test system solutions segment) - Sale of services\n\u00b7\nWessex Precision Instruments Limited - Non trading\nThe CODM monitors the operating results of each segment for the purpose of performance assessments and making decisions on resource allocation. Performance is based on revenue generations and profit before tax, which the CODM believes are the most relevant in evaluating the results relative to other entities in the industry.\nInformation regarding each of the operations of each reportable segment is included below, all non-current assets owned by the Group are held in the UK.\nUtility detection and mapping services\nDevelopment, assembly and sale of GPR equipment\nAutomation and test system solutions\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 June 2025\nTotal segmental revenue\n1,537\n433\n1,773\n3,743\nOperating (loss) / profit\n68\n(114)\n164\n118\nFinance costs\n(53)\n(350)\n(25)\n(428)\n(Loss) / Profit before taxation\n15\n(464)\n139\n(310)\nSegment assets\n612\n430\n597\n1,639\nSegment liabilities\n659\n6,510\n878\n8,047\nNon-current asset additions\nRevaluation reserve-property\n3\n-\n-\n93\n15\n48\n18\n141\nDepreciation and amortisation\n44\n17\n109\n170\nUtility detection and mapping services\nDevelopment, assembly and sale of GPR equipment\nAutomation and test system solutions\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended 30 June 2024\nTotal segmental revenue\n1,448\n330\n7,360\n9,138\nOperating (loss) / profit\n85\n154\n(1,454)\n(1,215)\nFinance costs\n(35)\n(335)\n(54)\n(424)\n(Loss) / Profit before taxation\n50\n(181)\n(1,508)\n(1,639)\nSegment assets\n497\n322\n1,112\n1,931\nSegment liabilities\n579\n6,319\n1,220\n8,118\nNon-current asset additions\n48\n-\n47\n95\nDepreciation and amortisation\n60\n18\n541\n619\n3 Finance costs\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nInterest payable\n428\n424\n428\n424\nInterest payable comprises interest on:\nLeases\n11\n23\nDirectors' loans\n259\n259\nOther\n158\n142\n428\n424\n4 Operating profit for the year\nThis is arrived at after charging for the Group:\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nResearch and development costs not capitalised\n611\n602\nDepreciation and amortisation\nImpairment of goodwill\nImpairment of stock recognised as an expense\n170\n-\n7\n619\n163\n10\nAuditor's remuneration\nFees payable to the Company's auditor for the audit of the Group's financial statements\n33\n53\nFees payable to the Company's auditor and its subsidiaries for the provision of tax services\n5\n-\nThe Company's audit fee is \u00a318,000 (2024: \u00a329,000).\n5 Staff costs\nGroup\n2025\n2024\nNo.\nNo.\nAverage monthly number of employees, including directors:\nProduction and research\n33\n89\nSelling and research\n5\n9\nAdministration\n9\n10\n47\n108\nGroup\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nStaff costs, including directors:\nWages and salaries\n1,454\n4,313\nSocial security costs\n143\n414\nOther pension costs\n77\n227\n1,674\n4,954\nCompany\n2025\n2024\nNo.\nNo.\nAverage monthly number of employees, including directors:\nSelling and research\n-\n-\nAdministration\n1\n1\n1\n1\nCompany\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nStaff costs, including directors:\nWages and salaries\n124\n82\nSocial security costs\n-\n-\nOther pension costs\n-\n-\n124\n82\n6 Directors' remuneration\nSalary\nand fees\nBenefits\nin kind\n2025\nTotal\n2024\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nG G Watt\n71\n-\n71\n71\nR MacDonnell\n2\n-\n2\n2\nT Williams\n10\n-\n10\n9\nAggregate emoluments\n83\n-\n83\n82\nDirectors' pensions\n2025\n2024\nNo.\nNo.\nThe number of directors who are accruing retirement benefits under:\nDefined contributions policies\n-\n-\nThe directors represent key management personnel.\nRefer to note 18 for details of directors share options.\n7\nTaxation\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nUnited Kingdom Corporation Tax\nCurrent taxation\n(51)\n(68)\nAdjustments in respect of prior years\n-\n120\n(51)\n52\nDeferred taxation\n-\n-\nTax on loss\n(51)\n52\nCurrent tax reconciliation\nTaxable loss for the year\n(310)\n(1,639)\nTheoretical tax at UK corporation tax rate 19% (2024: 19%)\n(59)\n(383)\nEffects of:\nR&D tax credit adjustments\n(99)\n(38)\nFixed asset timing differences\n1\n4\nNot deductible for tax purposes\nImpairment of goodwill\n8\n-\n259\n(31)\nDeferred tax not recognised\n98\n229\nAdjustments in respect of prior years\n-\n120\nUtilisation of losses\n-\n1\nShort term timing differences\n-\n(109)\nTotal income tax (credit) / charge\n( 51)\n52\nThe Group has tax losses amounting to approximately \u00a33,293,000 (2024: \u00a33,807,000), available for carry forward to set off against future trading profits\n.

Directors' loans comprise of two elements. A loan attracting interest at 2.15% over Bank of England base rate. At the year-end \u00a32,336,000 (2024: \u00a32,342,000) was outstanding in relation to this loan. During the year to 30 June 2025 \u00a3241,000 (2024: \u00a3543,000) was repaid. The Company has the right to defer payment for a period of 366 days.\nOn 13 August 2010 the Company issued \u00a31 million of Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock (\"CULS\") to G.G Watt, the Chairman of the Company. The CULS were issued to replace loans made by G.G Watt to the Company amounting to \u00a31 million and has been recognised in non-current liabilities of \u00a33,336,000.\nPursuant to amendments made on 13 November 2014, 9 November 2018 and 30 June 2022 the principal terms of the CULS are as follows:\n- The CULS may be converted at the option of Gordon Watt at a price of p per share at any time prior to 13 August 2026;\n- Interest is payable at a rate of 10 per cent per annum on the principal amount outstanding until converted, prepaid or repaid, calculated and compounded on each anniversary of the issue of the CULS. On conversion of any CULS, any unpaid interest shall be paid within 20 days of such conversion;\n- The CULS are repayable, together with accrued interest on 13 August 2026 (\"the Repayment Date\").\nNo equity element of the convertible loan stock was recognised on issue of the instrument as it was not considered to be material.\nBank and other loans\nIncluded in bank and other loans is an invoice discounting facility of \u00a3218,774 (2024: \u00a3170,766).\nThe principal terms of which are interest at 2.58% over Bank of England base rate and secured on the company's debtors.\nIncluded in bank and other loans is a secured mortgage of \u00a378,417 which incurs an interest rate of 2.44% over base rate for 10 years and at a rate of 2.64% over base thereafter.\nAs a result of COVID 19, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) became available for the business. This enabled the group to secure two loans. The loan for \u00a3400,000 had a remaining balance outstanding of \u00a387,000, at a rate of 3.96%, over base and the second loan of \u00a3150,000 had a remaining balance outstanding of \u00a340,000, at a rate of 2.96% over base.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group's operations.\nThe main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. A number of procedures are in place to enable these risks to be controlled. For liquidity risk these include profit/cash forecasts by business segment, quarterly management accounts and comparison against forecast. The board reviews and agrees policies for managing this risk on a regular basis.\nCredit risk\nThe credit risk exposure is the carrying amount of the financial assets as shown in note 14 (with the exception of prepayments which are not financial assets) and the exposure to the cash balances. Of the amounts owed to the Group at 30 June 2025, the top 3 customers comprised 70% (2024: 41%) of total trade receivables.\nThe Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and the Group uses its own trading records to rate its major customers, also the Group invoices in advance where possible. The Group's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Having regard to the credit worthiness of the Groups significant customers the directors believe that the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.\nWithin revenue there are two customers which individually represent 22.4% and 10.0% of the overall revenue for the financial year, this compared to 11.8% and 9.1% in the previous financial year\n.\nAn analysis of trade and other receivables:\n2025\nWeighted average loss rate\nGross carrying\nvalue\nImpairment loss allowance\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nPerforming\n0.00%\n728\n-\n2024\nWeighted average loss rate\nGross carrying value\nImpairment loss allowance\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nPerforming\n0.00%\n1,007\n-\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group finances its operations through a mixture of shareholders' funds and borrowings. The Group borrows exclusively in Sterling and principally at fixed and floating rates of interest and are disclosed at note 16.\nAs disclosed in note 16 the Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on its borrowings with a variable element of interest. If interest rates were to increase by one percentage point the interest charge would be \u00a323,000 higher. An equivalent decrease would be incurred if interest rates were reduced by one percentage point.\nLiquidity risk\nAs stated in note 1 the Executive Chairman, G.G Watt, has pledged to provide ongoing financial support for a period of at least twelve months from the approval date of the Group statement of financial position. It is on this basis that the directors consider that neither the Group nor the Company is exposed to a significant liquidity risk.\nContractual maturity analysis for financial liabilities:\n2025\nLess than\n1 year\nDue between\n1-2 years\nDue between\n2 - 5+ years\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTrade and other payables\n966\n-\n-\n966\nBorrowings\nLease liability\n3,285\n116\n3,540\n25\n42\n56\n6,867\n197\n4,367\n3,565\n98\n8,030\n2024\nLess than\n1 year\nDue between\n1-2 years\nDue between\n2 - 5+ years\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTrade and other payables\n1,374\n121\n-\n1,495\nBorrowings\nLease liability\n2,818\n111\n3,614\n96\n70\n-\n6,502\n207\n4,303\n3,831\n70\n8,204\nFinancial liabilities of the Company are all due within less than three months with the exception of the intercompany balances that are due between 1 and 5 years.\nFair value of financial instruments\nLoans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.

          "content": "14 Mar 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 6366A\nPipeHawk PLC\n14 March 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) no. 596/2014 (which forms part of domestic UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018)\u00a0(\"MAR\"). With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n14 March 2025\nPipeHawk plc\n(\"PipeHawk\", \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nUnaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2024\nChairman's Statement\nIn my Chairman's Statement accompanying the unaudited interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2023 (\"H1 2023\"), I congratulated the Governor of the Bank of England on delivering a sterling job of dampening down demand such that, with associated economic and political headwinds, very few new orders were placed during the period concerned, with the notable exception of Adien Ltd (\"Aiden\"). This continued negative sentiment coupled with two anticipated material orders not being forthcoming ultimately contributed to QM Systems Limited (\"QM\") being placed into administration just as the six-month period on which I am now reporting started.\nNevertheless, PipeHawk's remaining key subsidiaries have performed well in the circumstances enabling the Group to report a return to net profitability. The Group's turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2024 was \u00a32,089,000 (H1 2023: \u00a34,572,000). This represented a decrease of approximately 54% over the comparable period last year, which included QM, although represented an increase of approximately 83% if QM's turnover of \u00a33,431,000 for H1 2023 is excluded. The Group's profit before taxation was \u00a329,000 (H1 2023: loss before tax of \u00a3633,000; \u00a3203,000 loss before tax if QM is excluded) and the Group's profit after taxation was \u00a359,000 (H1 2023: loss after tax of \u00a3441,000).\nAs mentioned in November 2024 in the annual report and accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group's remaining key subsidiaries service the utilities, government and rail industries and, hence, are significantly less reliant on the confidence of private sector businesses to commit funds for major investment projects. Though, somewhat ironically, while Network Rail has a reported budget of \u00a344 billion to spend on UK rail infrastructure in the five years from April 2024, Network Rail seems very reticent to place orders with its Tier 1 suppliers. As a result, the start to the current calendar year has been slower than that I would have wished. Nevertheless, the prospective order book across all three operating subsidiaries remains buoyant, and I am confident that the overall recovery will continue.\nThomson Engineering Design Ltd (\"TED\")\nTED continues to see steady activity for request for quotes (\"RFQs\") in the UK for strategic equipment as contracts are slowly released from Network Rail. This steady activity may be attributed to the change in the UK government and its subsequent release of the UK autumn budget last year.\nSome of these RFQs have translated into orders for TED's innovative designs which we believe will push the rail industry into the 21st century both for Network Rail and for other UK contractors which can only be taken as a positive. We now hope to build on these UK orders going forward and as Network Rail builds up the momentum necessary to upgrade the UK's ageing rail infrastructure.\nThe strategic relationship between Unipart Rail Limited (\"Unipart\") and TED continues to go from strength to strength. In September 2024, a suite of TED's equipment was exhibited at the world's largest bi-annual rail show, InnoTrans in Berlin, at which 80 positively qualified potential sales leads were generated. We believe that our presence at this show continues to establish TED's standing to the rest of the world.\nThe respective regional Unipart sales teams are now tasked with following up those leads to bring them to fruition.\nPlans are now established also to exhibit TED's innovative products at the IAF Technology Show in Germany in May 2025, which is the largest exhibition for track technology in Europe, occurring only once every three years.\nWe believe that the proactive continuation of Unipart's global marketing initiatives will ensure that TED's products are embedded in future rail infrastructure projects around the world.\nThe Unipart rail attachment business remains stable with a regular monthly order intake, as sales relationships are firmly established around the world, including most recently in Australia, Canada, America and France.\nAdien\nJuly to December 2024 proved to be a positive period for Adien, off the back of strong activity from the sales team in the first six months of that year. In this regard, Adien was at 95%+ capacity during this half-year period. Much of this activity saw Adien mainly committed to the Scottish and Southern Electricity (\"SSE\") projects together with a healthy number of ministry of defence and telecommunication sites.\nThe current Adien order book is strong, with a few large projects seeing the site teams booked until the end of April 2025. Following on from a refocus regarding networking and marketing, Adien was able to secure a good selection of new clients over this six-month period with purchase orders and commitments for a number of large projects expected to start in the current calendar year.\nAdien has managed to secure around 50% of the new operatives required for our planned further site teams over this period, who are now in training.\nWith the new asset management plan (AMP) phases being issued in the new year for the water industry, Adien's sales team is planning for this and are already looking to several national suppliers for collaboration on a tranche of projects which are expected to start in the summer of 2025.\nUtsi Electronics Ltd (\"Utsi\")\nAs global events continue to affect order schedules across multiple markets, it has been a slower than expected first six months for UTSI but one which carries with it the prospect of a much brighter future.\nWith major customers now more familiar with the cyclical nature of 'the new normal', their returning confidence is being reflected in a more buoyant, regular and substantive order outlook which, on current signs, promises to deliver a busy and more positive year end.\nNegotiating the peaks and troughs of component availability and their corresponding cost fluctuations, in order to effect delivery of these increasing orders will however place greater strains on the Group's cashflow in the short term, as we are forced to move away from using a 'just in time' model.\nWith our continued R&D investment into new product lines and re-design of those existing products which may now provide greater returns from having more time/cost effective build processes, the future for UTSI is looking\nbright.\nFinancial position\nAs announced on 28 November 2024, my letter of financial support was renewed on 20 November 2024 to provide the Group with financial support until 31 December 2025.\nIn addition to the loan I have provided to the Company in previous years, my fellow directors and I have deferred a certain proportion of our fees and interest payments due on loans until the Company is in a suitably strong position to make these payments in full.\u00a0During the six months ended 31 December 2024, these deferred fees and interest payments amounted to approximately \u00a3134,000 in total, all of which have been accrued in the Company's interim results, and at 31 December 2024 amounted in total to \u00a32,169,000.\nGordon Watt\nChairman\nEnquiries:\nPipeHawk Plc\nGordon Watt (Chairman)\nTel no. 01252 338 959\nAllenby Capital (Nomad and Broker)\nDavid Hart / Vivek Bhardwaj\nTel no. 020 3328 5656\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 31 December 2024\n6 months ended 31 December 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\n6 months ended 31 December 2023\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3'000\nYear ended\n30 June\n2024 (audited)\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n2,089\n4,572\n9,138\nStaff costs\nImpairment of goodwill\n(831)\n-\n(2,404)\n-\n(4,954)\n(163)\nGeneral administrative expenses\n(1,021)\n(2,566)\n(5,236)\nProfit / (Loss) on ordinary activities before interest, taxation and exceptional items\n237\n(398)\n(1,215)\nFinance costs\n(207)\n(235)\n(424)\nProfit / (Loss) before taxation\nand exceptional items\n30\n(633)\n(1,639)\nTaxation credit / (charge)\n29\n192\n(52)\nProfit / (Loss)\nfor the period attributable to equity holders of the Company\n59\n(441)\n(1,691)\nExceptional gains on de-recognition (QM Systems)\n-\n-\n870\nOther comprehensive income\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income / (expense) for the period net of tax\n59\n(441)\n(821)\nProfit / (Loss) per share (pence) -
