Despite a temporary setback with the discontinuation of a toxicology study, the Company\nhas made significant operational progress, including the appointment of a leading global contract research organisation (CRO), and is now well-positioned to restart these important studies and advance towards Phase 2 development.\nSDC-1801 (autoimmune disease)\nSDC-1801, Sareum's selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor, remains positioned as a potential treatment for a range of autoimmune diseases, with an initial focus on psoriasis, an autoimmune condition affecting the skin.\nAs previously announced, SDC-1801 has completed Phase 1 clinical development. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that SDC-1801 achieved blood plasma levels significantly exceeding the predicted therapeutic exposure, with a half-life of 17-20 hours supporting once-daily dosing with a smooth delivery of drug over the dosing period. Importantly, no deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported, and the frequency of adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in the active and placebo groups.\nNotably, SDC-1801 has not exhibited any of the potentially dose-limiting side effects that have been observed with leading dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors in clinical development, reinforcing the molecule's differentiated profile and best-in-class potential.\nFollowing successful completion of the clinical trial, two large-scale batches of SDC-1801 have been manufactured: one under GMP conditions for future planned clinical studies, and a non-GMP batch for the Phase 2 enabling toxicology studies.\nProcess chemistry improvements have enhanced the purity profile of SDC-1801 while maintaining good manufacturing yield.\nA programme of work to optimise the capsule formulation of SDC-1801 is underway, aimed at enhancing drug release at higher doses and reducing the number of capsules required per dose in future clinical trials.\nConsiderable progress has been made, and the Company expects this project to conclude in Q1 2026.\nAs announced on 10 October 2025, the Company discontinued its 16-week GLP preclinical toxicology study for SDC-1801 following unexpected safety findings, observed by the third-party provider of the study. These findings occurred at a higher incidence in control-group animals that received an inactive dosing solution compared to those dosed with SDC-1801.\nThe Company has now appointed a different leading global CRO, with extensive experience in long-term toxicology studies, to restart the Phase 2-enabling toxicology programme. Prior to commencing the full 16-week toxicology study, the Company will conduct a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate four different formulations, three liquid formulations for gavage dosing and one capsule formulation. This five-day study will provide valuable data on both tolerability and exposure levels, helping to optimise the formulation selection for the full toxicology study.\nThe carrier formulation is specific to the animal toxicology studies only and will not form part of any human dosing regimen.\nThe PK study is expected to commence imminently, with the full toxicology study expected to restart as early as possible in Q1 2026. Both studies will be completed using the Company's existing cash resources and the existing toxicology batch of SDC-1801.\nSDC-1802 (cancer immunotherapy)\nTranslational studies with SDC-1802 have been completed, providing a solid data package to support potential further development. The strongest cancer response was seen in haematological cancers, with significant unmet medical need, including T-ALL and B-cell lymphoma.\nThe Company is reviewing how best to progress SDC-1802 into clinical development and notes that partnering may be the preferred route at this stage.\nSRA737 (cancer)\nSRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms.\nIn March 2025, the former US licence arrangement for SRA737 was terminated and the asset reverted to the CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF). Sareum successfully acquired the licence for SRA737 following this termination, renegotiating significantly improved economic terms. The Company now receives 63.5% of all future revenues compared to 27.5% under the former agreement, at no cost to the Company.\nThe Company continues to explore partnering opportunities for SRA737, building on positive Phase 1/2 data that demonstrated good tolerability as monotherapy and promising activity in combination with low-dose gemcitabine in anogenital cancers, an area of significant unmet medical need.\nFurthermore,\nSareum has maintained an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), opened by the previous licence holder, to conduct a Phase 1 trial in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The Company retains sufficient stock of SRA737 capsules to conduct such a trial.\nThe Company remains confident in the potential of SRA737 and is assessing the most effective routes to progress and create value from this asset.\nTYK2 Neuroscience Programme (CNS)\nSareum has initiated a collaboration with Receptor.AI to accelerate discovery of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant, isoform-selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors for potential use in neuro-inflammatory indications such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.\nThis programme builds on earlier preclinical work from the Company's SKIL platform, which demonstrated blood-brain barrier permeability of selected TYK2/JAK1 molecules. The collaboration extends the relevance of Sareum's TYK2/JAK1 expertise into central nervous system diseases, areas of increasing scientific and commercial interest.\nA first batch of compounds have been designed and synthesized and are currently undergoing testing in biochemical assays to assess their potency against the JAK kinases, and in early-stage\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (\nADME) assays to assess their potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and give sufficient exposure at the target site.\nFuture Direction\nAs part of a broader value-realisation strategy, Sareum has engaged a specialist US-based business development consultancy to actively broaden and accelerate ongoing partnering discussions for SDC-1801 and SRA737.\nThe Board continues to prioritise non-dilutive funding routes to advance the pipeline and protect shareholder value, with current core activities funded from existing cash resources.\nSareum continues to review the optimum level of staffing for the Company, including Chief Medical Officer and Chief Executive Officer roles.\nSummary\nSareum has made substantial progress across its pipeline during 2025. The positive Phase 1 data for SDC-1801, together with the competitive profile versus other TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors in development, continues to support SDC-1801's potential as a best-in-class, once-daily oral therapy for autoimmune diseases. Despite the frustrating delay to the toxicology study, the Company's confidence in the molecule remains strong, and the study is now on track to restart in Q1 2026.\nThe significantly improved economic terms for SRA737, coupled with active partnering discussions for this asset and SDC-1802, position the Company to create value across its portfolio. The new TYK2 neuroscience collaboration adds further long-term potential. The Company has engaged specialist business development consultants to support partnering efforts across key programmes.\nWith strengthened intellectual property, a clear operational roadmap, active business development initiatives, and sufficient financial resources, the Company enters the new period with confidence and a clear set of value-creating milestones ahead.\nWe would like to thank our shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.\nAGM Webcast\nA live webcast to the investment community will be made available online via the Investor Meet Company platform. Existing and potential investors wishing to participate in the presentation can register on\nwww.investormeetcompany.com/sareum-holdings-plc/register-investor\n.

Despite a temporary setback with the discontinuation of a toxicology study, the Company\nhas made significant operational progress, including the appointment of a leading global contract research organisation (CRO), and is now well-positioned to restart these important studies and advance towards Phase 2 development.\nSDC-1801 (autoimmune disease)\nSDC-1801, Sareum's selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor, remains positioned as a potential treatment for a range of autoimmune diseases, with an initial focus on psoriasis, an autoimmune condition affecting the skin.\nAs previously announced, SDC-1801 has completed Phase 1 clinical development. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that SDC-1801 achieved blood plasma levels significantly exceeding the predicted therapeutic exposure, with a half-life of 17-20 hours supporting once-daily dosing with a smooth delivery of drug over the dosing period. Importantly, no deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported, and the frequency of adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in the active and placebo groups.\nNotably, SDC-1801 has not exhibited any of the potentially dose-limiting side effects that have been observed with leading dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors in clinical development, reinforcing the molecule's differentiated profile and best-in-class potential.\nFollowing successful completion of the clinical trial, two large-scale batches of SDC-1801 have been manufactured: one under GMP conditions for future planned clinical studies, and a non-GMP batch for the Phase 2 enabling toxicology studies.\nProcess chemistry improvements have enhanced the purity profile of SDC-1801 while maintaining good manufacturing yield.\nA programme of work to optimise the capsule formulation of SDC-1801 is underway, aimed at enhancing drug release at higher doses and reducing the number of capsules required per dose in future clinical trials.\nConsiderable progress has been made, and the Company expects this project to conclude in Q1 2026.\nAs announced on 10 October 2025, the Company discontinued its 16-week GLP preclinical toxicology study for SDC-1801 following unexpected safety findings, observed by the third-party provider of the study. These findings occurred at a higher incidence in control-group animals that received an inactive dosing solution compared to those dosed with SDC-1801.\nThe Company has now appointed a different leading global CRO, with extensive experience in long-term toxicology studies, to restart the Phase 2-enabling toxicology programme. Prior to commencing the full 16-week toxicology study, the Company will conduct a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate four different formulations, three liquid formulations for gavage dosing and one capsule formulation. This five-day study will provide valuable data on both tolerability and exposure levels, helping to optimise the formulation selection for the full toxicology study.\nThe carrier formulation is specific to the animal toxicology studies only and will not form part of any human dosing regimen.\nThe PK study is expected to commence imminently, with the full toxicology study expected to restart as early as possible in Q1 2026. Both studies will be completed using the Company's existing cash resources and the existing toxicology batch of SDC-1801.\nSDC-1802 (cancer immunotherapy)\nTranslational studies with SDC-1802 have been completed, providing a solid data package to support potential further development. The strongest cancer response was seen in haematological cancers, with significant unmet medical need, including T-ALL and B-cell lymphoma.\nThe Company is reviewing how best to progress SDC-1802 into clinical development and notes that partnering may be the preferred route at this stage.\nSRA737 (cancer)\nSRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms.\nIn March 2025, the former US licence arrangement for SRA737 was terminated and the asset reverted to the CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF). Sareum successfully acquired the licence for SRA737 following this termination, renegotiating signif",

Recent additional data has confirmed that the control group were not dosed with SDC-1801, and the findings are therefore considered unrelated to SDC-1801.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is in discussions with several contract research organisations (CROs) to restart the study as soon as possible, using existing cash resources.\n\u00b7\nPositive topline data from the Phase 1 clinical trial both single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) reported, demonstrating a favourable safety and tolerability profile, pharmacokinetics supportive of once-daily dosing and dose-responsive pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker reductions.\n\u00b7\nThe full dataset from the Phase 1 clinical trial has been submitted to an academic journal and is going through the journal's review process prior to publication.\n\u00b7\nPhase 2-enabling work, including non-clinical studies and formulation optimisation, is continuing and will support the initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\u00b7\nNone of the potentially dose-limiting side effects which were observed in brepocitinib, Pfizer/Priovant's investigational\ndual JAK1 and TYK2 inhibitor being developed as an oral treatment for inflammatory autoimmune diseases\n.\n\u00b7\nPatent protection further strengthened with allowances granted in the United States (July 2024) and China (September 2024) covering molecular structure and crystalline forms of the compound respectively.\nSDC-1802 (cancer immunotherapy)\n\u00b7\nTranslational studies with SDC-1802 have been completed, providing a solid data package to support potential further development.\n\u00b7\nThe strongest cancer response was seen in cancers with a significant level of unmet medical need\nincluding\nindications affecting relatively small patient populations, which are best suited to targeted development approaches.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is reviewing how best to progress SDC-1802 into clinical development and notes that partnering may be the preferred route at this stage.\nSRA737 (cancer)\n\u00b7\nIn March 2025, the former US licence arrangement for SRA737 was terminated and the asset reverted to the CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF).\n\u00b7\nSareum successfully acquired the licence for SRA737 following the termination of the licensing agreement. The Company renegotiated significantly improved economic terms, securing 63.5% of all future revenues compared to 27.5% under the former agreement at no cost to the Company.\nDiscovery programme in Central Nervous System (CNS) (post-period)\n\u00b7\nPost-period, Sareum announced a collaboration with Receptor.AI to accelerate discovery of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant, isoform-selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors for potential use in neuro-inflammatory indications such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. This builds on earlier preclinical work from the Company's SKIL platform, which demonstrated blood-brain barrier permeability of selected TYK2/JAK1 molecules.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nCash at 30 June 2025: \u00a33.5 million (\u00a31.5 million as of 30 June 2024).\n\u00b7\nAdministrative expenses (including R&D): \u00a33.38 million; R&D spend: \u00a32.07 million.\n\u00b7\nLoss before tax: \u00a33.06 million.\n\u00b7\nR&D tax credits received in the period: \u00a31.2 million (\u00a30.8 million in the year to 30 June 2024).\nDr Stephen Parker, Executive Chairman of Sareum, commented:\n\"Sareum has made good progress across its pipeline in 2025 and is poised to advance development of its lead asset, SDC-1801, while advancing a promising collaboration in neuroscience.\"\n\"Despite the frustrating and unexpected discontinuation of the GLP toxicology study for SDC-1801, we remain confident in SDC-1801. The adverse findings occurred predominantly in control group animals and are unrelated to SDC-1801. We are already in discussions with several Contract Research Organisations to restart the study as quickly as possible, and our focus remains firmly on completing the Phase",

The safety issues were encountered at a higher incidence in the control-group animals which were given an inactive dosing solution compared to those that were actually dosed with SDC-1801.\nAccordingly, dosing has now been terminated, and the study will be formally closed following completion of scheduled analyses and reporting activities.\nThe study was designed to support longer-term dosing of SDC-1801 and to investigate the molecule's general toxicology. These are key regulatory requirements ahead of the planned Phase 2 clinical development programme, which is expected to focus initially on psoriasis.\nA preliminary assessment of the available data indicates that the findings observed during the study were disproportionately present in control-group animals which were not treated with SDC-1801, and based on the information available, are therefore considered highly unlikely to be related to SDC-1801. Sareum is reviewing the study data with the contractor and expert consultants to determine the cause of the findings and the appropriate next steps.\nThe Company is also in discussions with alternative providers with the aim of restarting the study as soon as possible. Despite this set back, the Company anticipates being able to complete the full toxicology study, as originally scoped, with its existing cash resources.\nAs previously reported, the Phase 1 clinical study of SDC-1801 in healthy volunteers met its primary objectives and characterised a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with once-daily dosing. No safety concerns were identified.\nDr Stephen Parker, Executive Chairman of Sareum, said\n:\n\"While the need to terminate this study is frustrating, the preliminary data strongly suggest that the findings are unlikely to be associated with SDC-1801. Dosing has been terminated out of concern for animal welfare, and we are working closely with our partners and experts to understand the cause and identify a new provider with the aim of restarting the study as quickly as possible with our existing cash resources.\"\nSareum will provide a further update at the earliest possible opportunity once the review is complete.\n- Ends -\nFor further information:\nSareum Holdings plc\nStephen Parker, Executive Chairman\n01223 497700\nir@sareum.co.uk\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nJames Dance / James Bellman\n020 7409 3494\nO\nberon Capital (Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\n020 3179 5300\nICR Healthcare (Financial PR)\nJessica Hodgson / Davide Salvi\n020 3709 5700\nAbout Sareum\nSareum (AIM: SAR) is a biotechnology company developing next generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer.\nThe Company is focused on developing next generation small molecules which modify the activity of the JAK kinase family and have best-in-class potential.

There is strong scientific* and commercial interest in the role of JAK inhibitors, particularly TYK2, in these neuroinflammatory diseases, and the Company believes that a TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor that acts within the brain will be a successful approach to their treatment.\nThe agreement is designed to augment and support Sareum's\npreviously announced\npreclinical work, which identified three TYK2/JAK1 compounds with meaningful BBB penetration. The identified compounds include one that showed particularly strong levels of free drug in the brain, reinforcing their potential in treating diseases requiring central nervous system (CNS) exposure.\nSareum will oversee compound synthesis, laboratory testing, and profiling of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (collectively known as ADMET) to assess how potential drug candidates behave in the body.\nReceptor.AI will support this work with a tailored in-silico programme, applying its proprietary AI-enabled platform to support compound discovery and optimisation, using virtual screening and molecular design tools to identify candidates with strong target binding, brain penetration, selectivity, and synthetic feasibility. Designing BBB-permeable, isoform-selective kinase inhibitors is challenging, and Receptor.AI's tools provide generative chemistry and predictive modelling which significantly streamlines this process, enhancing success and increasing the speed of early-stage development.\nThe work for this project is expected to begin imminently and is expected to complete within four months. Sareum will own all intellectual property and compounds arising from the collaboration and there will be no ongoing milestone payments due to Receptor.AI following the conclusion of project.\n* Central TYK2 inhibition identifies TYK2 as a key neuroimmune modulator, PNAS 2025, 122 (13)\nDr Stephen Parker, Executive Chairman of Sareum, commented\n:\n\"\nThis collaboration is a logical and timely next step following our recent findings on BBB-penetrant TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors. Receptor.AI's expertise in integrating predictive modelling and generative chemistry into the discovery process will help us accelerate the identification of high-potential candidates for neuroinflammatory conditions. This technology allows us to harness the speed and accuracy of AI to derisk and optimise our discovery and early development.\"\nDr Alan Nafiev, Chief Executive Officer of Receptor.AI, added:\n\"\nOur partnership with Sareum reflects the potential for AI to systematically optimise early-stage discovery. Our closed-loop workflow enables multi-parameter optimisation from day one, combining structural modelling, generative chemistry, and predictive profiling to address binding, selectivity, brain penetration, and synthetic feasibility simultaneously.\"\n- ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nSareum Holdings plc\nStephen Parker, Executive Chairman\n01223 497700\nir@sareum.co.uk\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJames Dance / James Bellman\n020 7409 3494\nO\nberon Capital (Joint Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\n020 3179 5300\nICR Healthcare (Financial PR)\nJessica Hodgson / Davide Salvi\n020 3709 5700\nAbout Sareum\nSareum (AIM: SAR) is a\nbiotechnology company developing next generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer.\nThe Company is focused on developing next generation small molecules which modify the activity of the JAK kinase family and have best-in-class potential.

This work reflects growing scientific and commercial interest in the role of TYK2 inhibition in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease - all areas with significant unmet medical need.\nThe study involved six compounds from Sareum's proprietary Sareum Kinase Inhibitor Library (\"SKIL\") platform, tested in preclinical models to assess their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (\"BBB\") - a key requirement for CNS drug development. Three compounds demonstrated meaningful BBB penetration, with one showing strong levels of free drug in the brain.\nWhile further optimisation is still required, the results support the potential for Sareum's TYK2/JAK1 chemistry to be applied to CNS indications.\nThe Company is assessing the potential next steps for these compounds, including whether to progress one or more into preclinical development.\nSRA737\nSRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms. Sareum has now received the full clinical dataset for SRA737, following the termination of its licensing agreement with a US-based partner in December 2024. This includes the Trial Master File and all associated documentation - these data amount to approximately 235Gb. With full operational control attained, Sareum is now positioned to conduct a comprehensive review of the programme's potential.\nStrategic options under consideration include re-licensing the asset or advancing it in-house with or without a partner. The former licensee has expressed continued confidence in SRA737's clinical profile, which Sareum believes will support potential future partnering discussions. A decision on the optimal path forward will be made in the context of broader pipeline priorities including the opportunity to enhance shareholder value through partnering or re-licensing.\nOngoing development of SDC-1801 and SDC-1802\nSareum continues to advance its lead autoimmune and oncology programmes:\n\u00b7\nSDC-1801, a selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor for autoimmune diseases, has completed Phase I clinical development, demonstrating a favourable safety and pharmacokinetic profile. Comprehensive data from the Phase I study has now been\npublished\non the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR). A 16-week toxicology study to support longer-term dosing is expected to commence in May 2025, with completion anticipated in Q4.\n\u00b7\nSDC-1802, a TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor for immuno-oncology applications, remains in preclinical development.

Significant dose-responsive biomarker effects were observed.\n\u00b7\nNo deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported, with frequency of adverse events (all mild or moderate) similar in active and placebo groups.\n\u00b7\nThe Clinical Study Report was received in December 2024.\n\u00b7\nStrengthened intellectual property position with:\no\nUS Patent and Trademark Office granted a patent (US Patent No. 12,187,716) on SDC-1801's chemical structure, its use in treating inflammatory diseases, and certain methods of chemical synthesis.\no\nPatent allowance in China protecting certain crystalline forms of SDC-1801 and methods of their preparation with a similar Decision to Grant that was recently received from the Japanese Patent Office.\nSRA737 (cancer)\nSRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms.\n\u00b7\nAfter the period end, Sareum successfully acquired the licence for SRA737 following the termination of a licensing agreement between CRT Pioneer Fund (\"CPF\") and a US-based licensee in December 2024.\n\u00b7\nSareum renegotiated significantly improved economic terms, securing 63.5% of all future revenues compared to 27.5% under the former agreement.\n\u00b7\nSRA737 has completed two phase 1/2 studies in patients with advanced cancers, one as a single agent and the other in combination with low-dose gemcitabine. An Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application has now been approved by the US Food & Drug Administration.\nSDC-1802 (cancer immunotherapy)\nSDC-1802\u00a0is a TYK2/JAK1\u00a0inhibitor being developed for cancer immunotherapy.\n\u00b7\nThe additional funding secured in October 2024 has enabled further translational and preclinical development studies on SDC-1802.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\u2022 Cash at 31 December 2024 of \u00a34.1m (\u00a30.4m as of 31 December 2023 and \u00a31.5m as of 30 June 2024).\n\u2022\nLoss on ordinary activities after taxation for the six months ended 31 December 2024 of \u00a31.2m, in line with expectations given the clinical trial activity (2023: restated loss of \u00a31.7m).\n\u00b7\nAfter the period end,\nSareum successfully raised \u00a31.07m through a subscription of\n8,560,000\nnew ordinary shares at 12.5 pence per share.\nDr Stephen Parker, Executive Chairman of Sareum, commented:\n\"\nSareum has made strong progress this period, marked by the successful completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial for SDC-1801. The trial confirmed a favourable safety profile and pharmacokinetics, reinforcing its potential as a once-daily treatment for autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. To support its progression to Phase 2 trials, we are preparing the necessary toxicology studies, supported by our strengthened financial position following a successful fundraising round.\n\"Beyond SDC-1801, we have also strengthened our patent portfolio and secured the licence for SRA737 on significantly improved economic terms - important strategic advances that enhance our pipeline. With a clear development path ahead, we remain confident in delivering value to shareholders as we advance these promising therapeutic candidates.\"\n- ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nSareum Holdings plc\nStephen Parker, Executive Chairman\n01223 497700\nir@sareum.co.uk\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nJames Dance / James Bellman\n020 7409 3494\nO\nberon Capital (Joint Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\n020 3179 5300\nHybridan LLP (Joint Broker)\nClaire Noyce\n020 3764 2341\nICR Healthcare (Financial PR)\nJessica Hodgson / Davide Salvi\n020 3709 5700\nAbout Sareum\nSareum (AIM: SAR) is a\nbiotechnology company developing next generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer.\nThe Company is focused on developing next generation small molecules which modify the activity of the JAK kinase family and have best-in-class potential.

SRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms.\nIn\nDecember 2024\n, the licence for SRA737 reverted to the CRT Pioneer Fund (\"\nCPF\n\"), a specialist oncology investment fund and former licensee of SRA737, following the termination of the agreement with the previous US-based licensee. Sareum has now acquired the licence and renegotiated the economic terms under which it will receive a net 63.5% of all future revenues, compared to 27.5% under the former agreement. The remaining interest is divided between CPF and Cancer Research Technology, the commercialisation arm of Cancer Research UK.\nOngoing costs associated with SRA737 will be limited to material and data storage, as well as intellectual property management. Sareum will provide further updates as it evaluates options for the programme.\nDr Stephen Parker, Executive Chairman of Sareum, said\n: \"We believe SRA737 remains a valuable asset, and gaining control of the licence puts us in a stronger position to explore potential partnerships or development opportunities. Given the existing clinical data, we remain optimistic about identifying a path forward that maximises SRA737's value.\"\nSareum continues to advance its lead programme, SDC-1801, a\nTYK2/JAK1 inhibitor following\nthe successful completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in\nJuly 2024\n,\nwhich demonstrated an excellent safety profile and\npromising therapeutic potential for a range of autoimmune diseases.\n- Ends -\nFor further information, please contact:\nSareum Holdings plc\nStephen Parker, Executive Chairman\n01223 497700\nir@sareum.co.uk\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nJames Dance / James Bellman\n020 7409 3494\nOberon Capital (J\noint\nBroker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\nHybridan LLP (J\noint\nBroker)\nClaire Noyce\n020 3179 5300\n020 3764 2341\nICR Healthcare\n(Financial PR)\nJessica Hodgson / Davide Salvi\n0203 709 5700\nAbout Sareum\nSareum Holdings (AIM:SAR) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer.\nThe Company is focused on developing next generation small molecules which modify the activity of the JAK kinase family and have best-in-class potential.

It was discovered and initially developed by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research in collaboration with Sareum, with funding from Sareum and Cancer Research UK. In January 2024, Sareum announced that its co-development partner the CRT Pioneer Fund (\"CPF\"), had entered into a development and commercialisation license for SRA737 with a private biopharma company in the US.\nSareum has been notified by CPF that it received notice of termination of the SRA737 licence from the US-based licensee on 26 December 2024. The notice period runs for 90 days and Sareum will meet the team from CPF to discuss what steps, if any, are appropriate to seek an alternative licensee once the asset has returned to CPF on 27th March 2025.\nStephen Parker, Executive Chairman of Sareum, commented:\n\"Although clearly disappointed by this outcome, Sareum is now fully focused on its pipeline of\nTYK2/JAK1 inhibitors and our priority is to drive our lead programme, SDC-1801, towards Phase 2 development.\"\nCPF\nacquired\nworldwide commercial rights to the programme in 2013 as part of a co-development agreement with Sareum. SRA737 was\nlicensed\nby CPF to Sierra Oncology in September 2016. Sierra progressed SRA737 through Phase 1/2 clinical development and, at the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting,\nreported\npositive preliminary efficacy and safety data from two clinical trials evaluating SRA737 as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Sierra did not progress the asset beyond the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and was acquired by GSK in 2022, with rights returned to CPF in January 2023.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSareum Holdings plc\nStephen Parker, Executive Chairman\n01223 497700\nir@sareum.co.uk\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nOberon Capital (Joint Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\n020 7409 3494\n0203 179 5300\nHybridan LLP (Joint Broker)\nClaire Noyce\n020 3764 2341\nICR H\nealthcare\n(Financial PR)\nJessica Hodgson / Davide Salvi\n020 3709 5700\nAbout Sareum\nSareum (AIM: SAR) is a\nbiotechnology company developing next generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer.\nThe Company is focused on developing next generation small molecules which modify the activity of the JAK kinase family and have best-in-class potential.

This was a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an oral formulation of SDC-1801 in healthy subjects.\nThe Phase 1 trial demonstrated that SDC-1801 achieved blood plasma levels significantly exceeding the predicted therapeutic exposure, with a half-life of 17-20 hours suggesting once-daily dosing will be possible. Importantly, no deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported, and based on the unblinded data, the frequency of adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in the active and placebo groups. No clinically significant effects were observed on any component of blood (including red blood cells, haemoglobin, reticulocytes, platelets or neutrophils) which have been affected by earlier generation JAK inhibitors.\nThe Clinical Study Report for the trial was received on 18 December 2024.\nThe recently announced additional funding of \u00a33.4 million through share subscriptions and in addition the receipt of a A$1.9 million (c. \u00a31 million) Australian tax credit, will support the next steps in the programme. This includes preparing the asset for Phase 2 clinical trials by undertaking additional drug product synthesis and toxicology studies. These studies, expected to conclude by mid-2025, are designed to meet regulatory requirements for longer dosing periods.\nThe Company has also strengthened its intellectual property position with two key patent milestones being achieved:\n\u00b7\nA Notice of Allowance from the US Patent and Trademark Office for a patent offering substantial protection on SDC-1801's chemical structure, its use in treating inflammatory diseases, and certain methods of chemical synthesis. This completes protection for the chemical structure of SDC-1801 in all of the major territories.\n\u00b7\nA patent allowance in China protecting certain crystalline forms of SDC-1801 and methods of their preparation, marking the first patent allowance protecting crystalline forms in any territory.\nSDC-1802 (cancer immunotherapy)\nSareum continues to advance development of SDC-1802, its second TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor designed specifically for cancer and cancer immunotherapy applications.\nThe funding secured in October 2024 will enable further translational and preclinical development studies on SDC-1802. The Company looks forward to reporting progress on these studies during the current period.\nLicensed Programme - SRA737: A Selective Chk1 inhibitor\nSRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms.\nOn 2 January 2024, Sareum\nannounced\nthat the Company's co-development partner, the CRT Pioneer Fund (\"CPF\"), entered into a development and commercialisation licence agreement for SRA737 (the \"Licensing Agreement\") with a private biopharma company based in the United States (the \"Licensee Company\"). Sareum received a US$137,500 upfront fee payable under the Licensing Agreement.\nAn additional fee of up to US$1.0 million cash and 500,000 shares in the Licensee Company may be payable to CPF, of which Sareum is entitled to a 27.5% share, upon the sooner of 12 months following the signing of the Licensing Agreement, or the event of the Licensee Company achieving certain commercial and material financing objectives.\nSummary\nSareum's management remains optimistic about its strong pipeline of kinase inhibitors and their potential to provide significant benefits to patients. The recent funding will enable the Group to conduct further development of SDC-1801, including the longer-term toxicology studies required to prepare the asset for Phase 2 clinical trials and undertake further translational and preclinical develop",

This funding, alongside a A$ 1.9 million (c. \u00a31 million) tax credit received on 8th October 2024, from Australia for running the Phase 1 clinical development of the Company's lead candidate SDC-1801, will enable the Company to conduct further development of SDC-1801, including longer-term toxicology studies, to prepare the asset for Phase 2 clinical trials thereby enhancing its potential value.\nUnder the terms of the Subscription, each subscriber will also be issued one five-year warrant, exercisable at the Subscription Price, for every Subscription Share issued (the \"\nSubscription Warrants\n\"). The Subscription Price represents a discount of approximately 27 per cent. to the closing middle market price for Sareum shares on 10th October 2024. In the event that the Company completes a future equity fundraise while the warrants remain exercisable at a price lower than 20p per new Ordinary Share, the exercise price of the unexercised Subscription Warrants will be automatically rebased to an exercise price equivalent to such lower issue price.\nUse of funds and Trial Progress\nThe net funds will be utilised by the Company to further develop its lead candidate SDC-1801, a dual inhibitor of JAK family kinases TYK2 and JAK1, culminating in longer-term toxicology studies required to support Phase 2 clinical trials in patients. Successful completion of such studies would represent a significant milestone in advancing SDC-1801 towards Phase 2 readiness, building upon the highly encouraging results from the recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial.\nThe Phase 1 trial of SDC-1801, which concluded in July 2024, demonstrated a favourable safety profile and achieved blood plasma levels significantly exceeding the predicted therapeutic exposure, with a long half-life of up to 20 hours. No serious adverse events attributable to SDC-1801 were observed.\nBased on the unblinded data now available, the Company is pleased to report that the frequency of adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in the active and placebo groups. No clinically significant effects were observed on any component of blood (including red blood cells, haemoglobin, reticulocytes, platelets or neutrophils) which have been affected by earlier generation JAK inhibitors.\nAnalysis of blood samples from subjects who received SDC-1801 for 10 days in the multiple ascending dose cohorts demonstrated clear, dose responsive, reductions in three biomarkers of JAK1 and/or TYK2 activity. This provides strong evidence that safe blood levels of SDC-1801 were able to significantly inhibit major inflammatory pathways.\nThe planned toxicology studies are designed to further validate the safety and tolerability of SDC-1801 over an extended period, providing essential data for regulatory submissions to conduct future clinical studies.\nThe Company anticipates that these studies will substantially enhance the compound's attractiveness to potential out-licensing partners, should it choose to pursue this strategic option for Phase 2 development.\nThrough this additional development work, Sareum intends to position SDC-1801 as a best-in-class TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor for autoimmune diseases, with an initial focus on psoriasis-a condition affecting over",

We look forward to building a strong data package to advance SDC-1801 to the next stage of its development.\n\"\nDr John Reader, Chief Scientific Officer of Sareum, added\n:\n\"\nThe success of this stage of the clinical trial demonstrates that high blood levels of a dual TYK2/JAK1 kinase inhibitor can be achieved without serious side effects. Together with the long half-life observed, we believe this potentially gives SDC-1801 significant advantages over its competitors. We're grateful to the volunteers who participated in this trial, and to the clinical staff who enabled its timely completion.\n\"\n- END -\nFor Further Information:\nSareum Holdings plc\nTim Mitchell, CEO\n01223 497700\nir@sareum.co.uk\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nJames Dance / James Bellman\n020 7409 3494\nHybridan LLP (Corporate Broker)\nClaire Noyce\n020 3764 2341\nICR Consilium (Financial PR)\nJessica Hodgson / Davide Salvi / Kumail Waljee\n0203 709 5700\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nAbout Sareum\nSareum Holdings (AIM: SAR) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer.\nThe Company is focused on developing next generation small molecules which modify the activity of the JAK kinase family and have best-in-class potential.

So yes sareum does seem to value but at same time  they dont seem to be progressing it. Its more of a well lets see approach. While you must be correct in that drugs get buried and killed off for not good reasons all the time, 737 has had opportunities but noone has run with it. So I would say market puts zero value on 737 and I do likewise. Sometimes you have to accept that sareum 20p valuation is correct as it has stumbled. That is not to say it cant reach 4 pounds or so this year with lots of good news,but currently we are where we are for a reason",

There may only be 2 or 3 years in which to make a profit before any pharma can use the compound for combo treatments.  IMO, this is why it isn't licenced yet.  This wouldnt dnt be a bad outcome for cancer treatments but in terms of monetary value. Without an extended patent window, There is very little for Sareum.  However, if the patent window can be extended. Then, IMO, it's game on. Personally, it's my belief that this is the strategy for 737.",

A review of current therapeutics for psoriasis: Systemic and topical use of non-biological drugs : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41553544/ \"Results: Among these, oral TYK2 inhibitors have shown the most consistent late-phase success, offering superior PASI responses, rapid onset of action, and favorable emerging long-term safety profiles. Early-phase studies of other targets report promising reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and lesion severity, though interpretation remains limited by small cohorts, short follow-up, and the lack of head-to-head comparisons. Topical therapies, especially corticosteroids, remain foundational first-line options and valuable adjuncts to systemic regimens. While topical JAK inhibitors have generated interest in clinical trials, their clinical efficacy has not paralleled the superior outcomes achieved with oral JAK/TYK2 inhibitors. \" 5.

I very rarely post so this is unusual for me: \"My isa shares break even at 34p I think. My sipp shares are 17p so am in profit with those already. The average moves around because I'm still adding to both pots. I'm 56 now. The risk of holding will be too great in a year or 2, max and I will need to start offloading to consolidate gains. \" Now - Please don't think I'm saying sell your shares now ..... you keep your shares for as many years as you want my friend :) ...... just please please please dont put your life on hold while you are waiting. Over the last few weeks I have had a few dreams about going on a sareum clinical trial but alas I don't beleive that will ever happen as their trials are or will be in different areas. I too have been hanging on for the likes of Sareum and a few others that have failed to launch for many years. Reason for the post .... in October I was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer at age 56 ... I am a couple of sessions in to my chemo having been lucky enough to be eligible for surgery due to my age and fitness (2 huskies) and now nuking whats left hopefully (doc says there is a 50% chance of living more than 2 years but i dont dwell on statistics to be honest. Life is too short - you are obviously planning for your future and the fact you are not filtered (i do that alot) means in my book you are a reasonable and decent individual whose posts I take value from and I wish you well. All I would ask is please make sure you start enjoying the fruits of your labour while you are still fit enough to do so as you just never know.  I realise I am making a big assumption that you are in good health..... if not sincere apologies .... if you are in good health ... then the well wishes of a random stranger never hurt anyone :^) All the best GGekko87",

Both never drew on their pensions.  I have to admit it did change what we do quite a lot. My retirement plans have always been pinned around being 60, upto 62 if needed. Two reasons, I dont have enough yet and the other is my other half is 8 years younger than me! However I would do it early if a windfall dropped on me.  SAR is that windfall. I have 400k shares so \u00a31 would effectively, be life changing. I believe we could \u00a32 or even \u00a33 per share and even that is only a \u00a3500 million market cap. I am still physically fit but aging means it can be a constant struggle to keep doing what I like to do. I lead a very simple life.  Running, walking, beers and a 4 year old Lab.  The Lab is a very good pub companion too.  Lets hope that Sareum come good in 26. Thankyou for your post.  I really hope the chemo and surgery help and give you more time.",

Hopefully it will come good and you can get yourself an exoskeleton for running. I watched an article on tv a couple of weeks back showing mountain rescue using them to run up mountains :^) Elcap -  I said those exact words about 5 months ago at my sister in laws funeral, then didn't do anything about it - silly me :^) ..... Potnak sounds like he has 'perspective' all wrapped up and could give good advice :^) Colboltblue - Lets hope Sareum comes really good so you can afford a live-in nurse at home when the time comes :^) I'll post again on october 9th 2027 - thats 2 years and one day :^) Thanks again all - much appreciated All the best to you all.",

Personally I hold the view that the science hasn\u2019t changed if anything it has improved following the trial in Oz.  RF was a F up no doubt but we have to move on, the tox trial explanation was opaque, I think with good reason, so I went along to the AGM to hear for myself and I felt reassured.  I think we will get an update RE AI which will be positive without being transformational, nonetheless another string to our bow.  I think later in Q1 we will get confirmation that the tox study has restarted with a different supplier.  As previously stated I think the thing that could massively change the company\u2019s finances and share price would be a 737 deal that gives us some cash in the bank and a clear runway ahead of us.",

It is way too early for any real value. 1802 is ready for a licence right now and that appears to be plan A, but both of the above are dependant on 1801 successfully completing an extended Tox study. These compounds together make a really nice package for any pharma with a TYK2 shaped hole in their pipeline.  I wouldn't be surprised if 737 is sold outright but this could depend on whether the patent life can be extended when used in combo.   Again, I wouldn't be surprised if this work is already underway. As we know patents can a while to be approved, we also know they can be hidden when commercially sensitive. Submarine patent, anyone? The published 1801 trial data, could be being held back for the same commercially sensitive reasons. I said this the other day. Massive risk still but maybe the last chance to buy for a proper multi bagger.",

Hopefully, reformulation going in the right direction and then interesting times ahead over Q1/Q2 - just my thoughts. Currently in Cornwall, so off to batten down the hatches awaiting Storm Goretti.

We aee in effect sub dividing further. Mot only are we looking at immunotherapy for auto immune but also pursuing compounds that can counteract nerve damage and it consequential repair. We are aware of 1801 to treat SLE, not yet trialled.l know.  But 1801 should enable the removal of debris allowing nerve endings to reoair. Requirement and preferred outcome to reoair nerve ending damage and reverse the symptons. If successful which highly likely, all well and good. 1801 in its design restricts the amount of Jak especially Jak1 that can enter the brain. The broader spectrum you treat and advantages thereof are offset by increase in off target effects. 1801 not to cross the BBB for CNS deliberate in its design. But that vwry nature we should be able to provide a compound that can penetrate BBB. There are indications in Central Nervous System which can be treated  but can only do so by crossing the blood brain barrier. Yhe peripheral nervous system which is outside brain and spinal chord has indications that can be treated without the need to penetrate the BBB. This can alo raise questions as to why we have not yet had a repirt of 1801 appear in a journal. 1801 may have to give info on its mechanisms of working  in SLE ( PNS) This may also identify the boundaries or limits of 1801 and for all dusease indications of the  central nervous system its inadequacies to breach BBB. Molecule makeup may come into it and as yet no patent protection protection for possible new compound. Sareum need be extremely careful as to what they submit in a journal , to give John Reader credit he addressed that at AGM 2024. So all very hush hush around a compound at design stage. To treat diseaese of the CNS will not happen with early repurposed drugs. They try but all have failed so far. What is required is in effect a hand tailored compound specifically for CNS disease indications An untapped market in areas of very high unmet need. Alzheimers is just one. Dementia? Regards",

If it's a JV, then the other party could install a CEO or an other role as figure head. My guess is, the timescales to any strategic reorganization of the company. Got extended when the tox study failed. I sensed a lot of frustration from JR in the IM call and it was practically leaking out of SP at the AGM.   I'm not saying we were at the endgame a biyout, I still think it will be licence deals but I do believe we were close to a strategic shift in how Sareum operate and that is now paused, waiting on the new Tox study.",

Reminds me of AGM 2024 Tim Mitchell  asking Stephen Parker  if he wanted him TM to read out the questions. Tim was removed from position of CEO. Calling stepping down. They give reasons. But no guarantee that is the truth. Tim really has little powers and may well have settled for ok you get on with it and l will keep to  1802 and 1803 development. Compounds need manufacturing. Whoever stated the requirements for manufacturing of the compound for the tox trial clearly made and extreme balls up. Potnak, why do you post incorrect  non factual information? The toxicology study was stopped that does not mean it is a failure. If it were a failure they would not be tweaking the compound and arranging new trial. I still believe conpany may be on an intended  takeover and halting toxicology study will delay. If this proves to be the case then they will also have 1803 in their arsenal.  This is in an area of very high urgent umet need. I think there are around 10 million new cases a  year in the US alone. Alzheimers not the same as Parkinsons disease It is a distinct possibility on selecting a suitable candidate and that phuccer has already been decided from the 6 compounds albeit requires optimisation which on its own is no mean feat. The brain is very good at removing  alien invaders. Just because you have a compound that is able ti penetrate the blood brain barrier what happens to the compound. Is this compound reduced efficacy when suspended in cerebral fluid. How is the residue removed from cerebral spinal fluid? How much of this is down to the excipient? It all comes to he who waits so it is said. But many of  us are getting just a tad bit tired of waiting. We have no idea hiw far we are away from the finish line . Regards",

          "content": "Several brain-penetrant kinase inhibitors have been recently approved or are in late-stage development for central nervous system (CNS) indications, primarily for brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for multiple sclerosis (MS). The latest approvals and emerging drugs include: FDA-Approved Kinase Inhibitors with CNS Activity Taletrectinib (Ibtrozi): Approved by the FDA in June 2025 for adults with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. It is noted for being a potent, CNS-active TKI with robust intracranial objective response rates in patients with brain metastases. Alectinib (Alecensa): Approved in April 2024 for adjuvant treatment of ALK-positive early-stage NSCLC. Alectinib is known to have superior intracranial efficacy and can effectively control brain metastases. Ensartinib: Received FDA approval in December 2024 for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. It demonstrates high brain penetration. Osimertinib (Tagrisso): A third-generation EGFR inhibitor, it received expanded FDA approval in September 2024 for unresectable Stage III NSCLC. It has excellent CNS penetration and is a standard of care for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Lorlatinib: An ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, it is effective in treating brain metastases in NSCLC and was approved for broader use in this indication. Zongertinib (Hernexeos) and Sevabertinib (Hyrnuo): These HER2-targeting kinase inhibitors received accelerated FDA approvals in August and November 2025, respectively, for NSCLC with HER2 mutations. Their CNS penetration is a key feature in treating brain metastases.",

          "content": "Good morning PC1954. With regards to your post @ 23.16. My humble apologies asi t looks like you have taken my post completely the wrong way. Do l think you do not know Tim is no longer CEO ? The answer to that is a resounding, no! I would not have thought reiterating Tims current postion would have caused such upset. Correct me if l am wrong  but you stated ' In nutshell if TM is carrying out the work as you state, why isn\u2019t he presenting/explaining his work to shareholders' I repied with 'Tim is no longer CEO he is COO and l dare say it is Stephen Parker who decides who says what.\" I think there has been  a slight misinterpretation on both sides. \"it\u2019s just my view, that he doesn\u2019t seem a very active part of Sareum - when and what was his last \u201cofficial\u201d statement (excluding reading the financials)?\" You have put 'active part' and in that aspect l have misnterpreted as having important contributory role. I certainly would agree that taking the term 'active roll ' in the context of involvement in controlling the company then you are 100 correct. The point l did not put across very well is my understanding of Tims current role. My understanding is that of development potential with Jak inhibitor to penetrate the blood brain barrier for treating ilnesses with respect to the Central Nervous System It is very easy to underestimate the complexity of issues and time consuming research is involved to produce something  that would fail, have mediocre efficacy caused by dose limiting toxicities. AI is not the 'be all\" or ' end all\" as some people may think. It certainly is vital in reducing the time to pyiduce a candidate. Al is also open to making mistakes. Binfing affinity  Kd is important eith respect to how long it remains stta hed to a docking site. It is complex and cannot just be left for AI to get on with. CommunIcation between AI and human intervention is absolutely crucial. As such l would conclude that this will easily consume Tims resources of time concentration and energy. No big deal here. The majority of the post can appear as if aimed at you which it was not. The majority was aimed at 'up one minute down the next Potnak\". Please accept my apologies for what l fhould have created 2 posts for. One final thing before l leave off ' I could pull your post to pieces, no need to as it doesn\u2019t really tell me anything as nonsensical in its content and just your perceived assumptions' Feel free and go ahead. I await your reply. Regards to all",

If you doubt what l am saying  and that us clearly evident you doubt anything l say then consult an expert on the subject. Message John Reader or Stephen Parker and ask them if 1801 failed to reach its endpoint. As l said the study was stopped at an early moment in time. Being stopped early is not conclusive evidence that the 1801 failed to reach its endpoint The failure aspect was not completing the trial. Now tell me in your infinite wisdom Potnak. Can the excipient that failed in toxicolpgy study be used again in humans? Should the excipient prove OK in animal testing then why not use this on humans. Bare in mind that there exists room to tweak the excipient. One problem to overcome is the incease in doseage of the active ingredient in a capsule. This has already been stated The importance of this is to allow once a day dosing and also gives rise to increased dosing capability. Both aspects of which are highly advantageous and further increases the gap between us and the likes of Breprocitinib. We already are head and shoulders above Breprocitinib.

These findings occurred at a higher incidence in control-group animals that received an inactive dosing solution compared to those dosed with SDC-1801. The Company has now appointed a different leading global CRO, with extensive experience in long-term toxicology studies, to restart the Phase 2-enabling toxicology programme. Prior to commencing the full 16-week toxicology study, the Company will conduct a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate four different formulations, three liquid formulations for gavage dosing and one capsule formulation. This five-day study will provide valuable data on both tolerability and exposure levels, helping to optimise the formulation selection for the full toxicology study. The carrier formulation is specific to the animal toxicology studies only and will not form part of any human dosing regimen. The PK study is expected to commence imminently, with the full toxicology study expected to restart as early as possible in Q1 2026. Both studies will be completed using the Company's existing cash resources and the existing toxicology batch of SDC-1801.",

However, forecasts vary, and some sources note the company lacks consistent historical data, with significant revenue projections for 2026 suggesting potential but early-stage development.

The stock had closed at $22.11 previously, with around 2.0 million shares changing hands so far. The move came after several insider disclosures. A Form 4 filing revealed director Srinivas Akkaraju purchased 588,235 shares at $17 each on Jan. 9, mostly via an investment fund. Another Form 4 showed director and 10% owner James B. Tananbaum acquired 411,764 shares at the same $17 price on Jan. 8 through Foresite-related funds. (SEC) Why it matters now: those buys came in close to the pricing of Alumis\u2019 recent stock offering. According to an earlier filing, the company sold 17.65 million shares at $17 apiece. The underwriters also fully exercised an option for an additional 2.65 million shares, pushing gross proceeds to roughly $345.1 million before fees.

I have just ran a request on chat gpt to produce a list of all of the trials that 737 has been used in and it is very interesting.

While you must be correct in that drugs get buried and killed off for not good reasons all the time, 737 has had opportunities but noone has run with it. So I would say market puts zero value on 737 and I do likewise. Sometimes you have to accept that sareum 20p valuation is correct as it has stumbled.

There may only be 2 or 3 years in which to make a profit before any pharma can use the compound for combo treatments.  IMO, this is why it isn't licenced yet.  This wouldnt dnt be a bad outcome for cancer treatments but in terms of monetary value. Without an extended patent window, There is very little for Sareum.  However, if the patent window can be extended. Then, IMO, it's game on. Personally, it's my belief that this is the strategy for 737.",

Early-phase studies of other targets report promising reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and lesion severity, though interpretation remains limited by small cohorts, short follow-up, and the lack of head-to-head comparisons.

This new era in pharmaceutical innovation showcases how AI can accelerate target identification, optimize molecules for clinical success, and reshape R&D economics. As regulators adapt to these technologies, the industry will likely see more AI-originated candidates entering late-stage trials and regulatory review. Zasocitinib\u2019s path from AI-assisted discovery to clinical validation underscores a future where complex therapeutic challenges can be met with computational precision and strategic insight. As the pharmaceutical landscape evolves, AI-driven discovery stands to deliver not only faster routes to new therapies but also deeper possibilities for addressing unmet medical needs across diverse diseases. \" If you arent AI-ing, are you even trying ;) 6.

Difference between 1891 and 1802 resulted in 1801 being used for autoimmune and not wanting jaks crossing  blood  brain barrier. 1802 in oncology is not handicapped in same way. We aee in effect sub dividing further. Mot only are we looking at immunotherapy for auto immune but also pursuing compounds that can counteract nerve damage and it consequential repair. We are aware of 1801 to treat SLE, not yet trialled.l know.  But 1801 should enable the removal of debris allowing nerve endings to reoair. Requirement and preferred outcome to reoair nerve ending damage and reverse the symptons. If successful which highly likely, all well and good. 1801 in its design restricts the amount of Jak especially Jak1 that can enter the brain. The broader spectrum you treat and advantages thereof are offset by increase in off target effects. 1801 not to cross the BBB for CNS deliberate in its design. But that vwry nature we should be able to provide a compound that can penetrate BBB. There are indications in Central Nervous System which can be treated  but can only do so by crossing the blood brain barrier. Yhe peripheral nervous system which is outside brain and spinal chord has indications that can be treated without the need to penetrate the BBB. This can alo raise questions as to why we have not yet had a repirt of 1801 appear in a journal. 1801 may have to give info on its mechanisms of working  in SLE ( PNS) This may also identify the boundaries or limits of 1801 and for all dusease indications of the  central nervous system its inadequacies to breach BBB. Molecule makeup may come into it and as yet no patent protection protection for possible new compound. Sareum need be extremely careful as to what they submit in a journal , to give John Reader credit he addressed that at AGM 2024. So all very hush hush around a compound at design stage. To treat diseaese of the CNS will not happen with early repurposed drugs. They try but all have failed so far. What is required is in effect a hand tailored compound specifically for CNS disease indications An untapped market in areas of very high unmet need. Alzheimers is just one. Dementia? Regards",

If the compounds are licenced and in the control a third party then it's a waiting game.  The company could run even leaner than it does now, while we wait.  If it's a JV, then the other party could install a CEO or an other role as figure head. My guess is, the timescales to any strategic reorganization of the company. Got extended when the tox study failed. I sensed a lot of frustration from JR in the IM call and it was practically leaking out of SP at the AGM.   I'm not saying we were at the endgame a biyout, I still think it will be licence deals but I do believe we were close to a strategic shift in how Sareum operate and that is now paused, waiting on the new Tox study.",

Reminds me of AGM 2024 Tim Mitchell  asking Stephen Parker  if he wanted him TM to read out the questions. Tim was removed from position of CEO. Calling stepping down. They give reasons. But no guarantee that is the truth. Tim really has little powers and may well have settled for ok you get on with it and l will keep to  1802 and 1803 development. Compounds need manufacturing. Whoever stated the requirements for manufacturing of the compound for the tox trial clearly made and extreme balls up. Potnak, why do you post incorrect  non factual information? The toxicology study was stopped that does not mean it is a failure. If it were a failure they would not be tweaking the compound and arranging new trial. I still believe conpany may be on an intended  takeover and halting toxicology study will delay. If this proves to be the case then they will also have 1803 in their arsenal.  This is in an area of very high urgent umet need. I think there are around 10 million new cases a  year in the US alone. Alzheimers not the same as Parkinsons disease It is a distinct possibility on selecting a suitable candidate and that phuccer has already been decided from the 6 compounds albeit requires optimisation which on its own is no mean feat. The brain is very good at removing  alien invaders. Just because you have a compound that is able ti penetrate the blood brain barrier what happens to the compound. Is this compound reduced efficacy when suspended in cerebral fluid. How is the residue removed from cerebral spinal fluid? How much of this is down to the excipient? It all comes to he who waits so it is said. But many of  us are getting just a tad bit tired of waiting. We have no idea hiw far we are away from the finish line . Regards",

The latest approvals and emerging drugs include: FDA-Approved Kinase Inhibitors with CNS Activity Taletrectinib (Ibtrozi): Approved by the FDA in June 2025 for adults with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. It is noted for being a potent, CNS-active TKI with robust intracranial objective response rates in patients with brain metastases. Alectinib (Alecensa): Approved in April 2024 for adjuvant treatment of ALK-positive early-stage NSCLC. Alectinib is known to have superior intracranial efficacy and can effectively control brain metastases. Ensartinib: Received FDA approval in December 2024 for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. It demonstrates high brain penetration. Osimertinib (Tagrisso): A third-generation EGFR inhibitor, it received expanded FDA approval in September 2024 for unresectable Stage III NSCLC. It has excellent CNS penetration and is a standard of care for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Lorlatinib: An ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, it is effective in treating brain metastases in NSCLC and was approved for broader use in this indication. Zongertinib (Hernexeos) and Sevabertinib (Hyrnuo): These HER2-targeting kinase inhibitors received accelerated FDA approvals in August and November 2025, respectively, for NSCLC with HER2 mutations. Their CNS penetration is a key feature in treating brain metastases.",

Do l think you do not know Tim is no longer CEO ? The answer to that is a resounding, no! I would not have thought reiterating Tims current postion would have caused such upset. Correct me if l am wrong  but you stated ' In nutshell if TM is carrying out the work as you state, why isn\u2019t he presenting/explaining his work to shareholders' I repied with 'Tim is no longer CEO he is COO and l dare say it is Stephen Parker who decides who says what.\" I think there has been  a slight misinterpretation on both sides. \"it\u2019s just my view, that he doesn\u2019t seem a very active part of Sareum - when and what was his last \u201cofficial\u201d statement (excluding reading the financials)?\" You have put 'active part' and in that aspect l have misnterpreted as having important contributory role. I certainly would agree that taking the term 'active roll ' in the context of involvement in controlling the company then you are 100 correct. The point l did not put across very well is my understanding of Tims current role. My understanding is that of development potential with Jak inhibitor to penetrate the blood brain barrier for treating ilnesses with respect to the Central Nervous System It is very easy to underestimate the complexity of issues and time consuming research is involved to produce something  that would fail, have mediocre efficacy caused by dose limiting toxicities. AI is not the 'be all\" or ' end all\" as some people may think. It certainly is vital in reducing the time to pyiduce a candidate. Al is also open to making mistakes. Binfing affinity  Kd is important eith respect to how long it remains stta hed to a docking site. It is complex and cannot just be left for AI to get on with. CommunIcation between AI and human intervention is absolutely crucial. As such l would conclude that this will easily consume Tims resources of time concentration and energy. No big deal here. The majority of the post can appear as if aimed at you which it was not. The majority was aimed at 'up one minute down the next Potnak\". Please accept my apologies for what l fhould have created 2 posts for. One final thing before l leave off ' I could pull your post to pieces, no need to as it doesn\u2019t really tell me anything as nonsensical in its content and just your perceived assumptions' Feel free and go ahead. I await your reply. Regards to all",

The toxicology study was stopped due to adverse events in the inactive compound. This does not automatically mean failure to reach its endpoint! Pedantic l am being, yes. If you doubt what l am saying  and that us clearly evident you doubt anything l say then consult an expert on the subject. Message John Reader or Stephen Parker and ask them if 1801 failed to reach its endpoint. As l said the study was stopped at an early moment in time. Being stopped early is not conclusive evidence that the 1801 failed to reach its endpoint The failure aspect was not completing the trial. Now tell me in your infinite wisdom Potnak. Can the excipient that failed in toxicolpgy study be used again in humans? Should the excipient prove OK in animal testing then why not use this on humans. Bare in mind that there exists room to tweak the excipient. One problem to overcome is the incease in doseage of the active ingredient in a capsule. This has already been stated The importance of this is to allow once a day dosing and also gives rise to increased dosing capability. Both aspects of which are highly advantageous and further increases the gap between us and the likes of Breprocitinib. We already are head and shoulders above Breprocitinib.

These findings occurred at a higher incidence in control-group animals that received an inactive dosing solution compared to those dosed with SDC-1801. The Company has now appointed a different leading global CRO, with extensive experience in long-term toxicology studies, to restart the Phase 2-enabling toxicology programme. Prior to commencing the full 16-week toxicology study, the Company will conduct a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate four different formulations, three liquid formulations for gavage dosing and one capsule formulation. This five-day study will provide valuable data on both tolerability and exposure levels, helping to optimise the formulation selection for the full toxicology study. The carrier formulation is specific to the animal toxicology studies only and will not form part of any human dosing regimen. The PK study is expected to commence imminently, with the full toxicology study expected to restart as early as possible in Q1 2026. Both studies will be completed using the Company's existing cash resources and the existing toxicology batch of SDC-1801.",

Alumis' Meteoric Rise To $20 From $5 In Just 60 Days On Plaque Psoriasis Trial Results : https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alumis-meteoric-rise-20-5-just-60-days-plaque-psoriasis-trial-results Plenty of insider buying too: 14.01.2026 \"Alumis Inc shares jumped roughly 9% to $24.11 by midday Wednesday, after fluctuating between $22.00 and $24.16 earlier. The stock had closed at $22.11 previously, with around 2.0 million shares changing hands so far. The move came after several insider disclosures. A Form 4 filing revealed director Srinivas Akkaraju purchased 588,235 shares at $17 each on Jan. 9, mostly via an investment fund. Another Form 4 showed director and 10% owner James B. Tananbaum acquired 411,764 shares at the same $17 price on Jan. 8 through Foresite-related funds. (SEC) Why it matters now: those buys came in close to the pricing of Alumis\u2019 recent stock offering. According to an earlier filing, the company sold 17.65 million shares at $17 apiece. The underwriters also fully exercised an option for an additional 2.65 million shares, pushing gross proceeds to roughly $345.1 million before fees. Alumis caught traders\u2019 attention after this month\u2019s Phase 3 results for envudeucitinib, an oral TYK2 inhibitor designed to block an immune-signaling enzyme linked to inflammation. The company reported that about 65% of patients achieved PASI 90\u2014a 90% improvement in psoriasis severity\u2014while over 40% reached PASI 100, meaning complete clearance, by week 24 across two trials. \u201cWe believe envudeucitinib demonstrates the full promise of TYK2 inhibition,\u201d said chief medical officer Dr. J\u00f6rn Drappa in the announcement.\" ATB",

So yes sareum does seem to value but at same time  they dont seem to be progressing it. Its more of a well lets see approach. While you must be correct in that drugs get buried and killed off for not good reasons all the time, 737 has had opportunities but noone has run with it. So I would say market puts zero value on 737 and I do likewise. Sometimes you have to accept that sareum 20p valuation is correct as it has stumbled. That is not to say it cant reach 4 pounds or so this year with lots of good news,but currently we are where we are for a reason",

There may only be 2 or 3 years in which to make a profit before any pharma can use the compound for combo treatments.  IMO, this is why it isn't licenced yet.  This wouldnt dnt be a bad outcome for cancer treatments but in terms of monetary value. Without an extended patent window, There is very little for Sareum.  However, if the patent window can be extended. Then, IMO, it's game on. Personally, it's my belief that this is the strategy for 737.",

          "content": "From AI: The Form 8.3 was filed by Serum Life Sciences Limited. \u2022 Who they are: They are a major investment arm of the Serum Institute of India and hold a ~14.2% stake in Sareum. \u2022 What they filed: Today\u2019s form was actually a disclosure of their 3.12% interest in Oxford Biomedica plc, which is currently in a takeover \"offer period.\" Because the names Serum and Sareum are so similar, and because Serum Life Sciences is the \"cornerstone\" investor for Sareum, this filing automatically triggered alerts for almost every Sareum shareholder. 2. Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",

          "content": "Utar. I'm not sure why you are here, if you think that.  Can I ask. When you stopped posting here, did you sell up and recently buy back in? You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share. That could be within a year.",

What do you want them to make a deal with.  The board made (were advised) to run an extended Toxicology study instead of a p1b trial. This in theory, if successful, would add value as the compound is effectively phase 2 ready. 1802 and possibly the new cns compounds are waiting on the results of the Tox study. For 737. I'm convinced that it the patent life, 7 years and counting.  It could take half of that to get into phase 3. So, with the above.  What is there to sell?

          "content": "Hey Bobbler, where exactly do you think a change in leadership will make a difference? They need to complete the Tox study before any deals on 1801 and 1802.  Presumably, they are similar enough that 1801 validates 1802 safety profile so the planned on licence should be fairly easy.  So we could see 2 deals close together or one bigger deal for both? Im expecting anything major for 737.  Maybe a commitment from a third party to pay for a combo trial and maybe an extended patent for combo use. CNS.  Still very early days but a successful Tox study and safety profile for 1801 will, hopefully give us a nice little package to push into a licence deal. IMO - it wouldn't matter who was running the company.  Without unlimited funds,  we need to wait for the Tox study to complete and based on experience, there is a good chance were not even close to starting it yet. The P1 trial data is just fluff.  It might generate some action here but the market will want tangible news. So where would a HNWI change things?",

          "content": "From AI: The Form 8.3 was filed by Serum Life Sciences Limited. \u2022 Who they are: They are a major investment arm of the Serum Institute of India and hold a ~14.2% stake in Sareum. \u2022 What they filed: Today\u2019s form was actually a disclosure of their 3.12% interest in Oxford Biomedica plc, which is currently in a takeover \"offer period.\" Because the names Serum and Sareum are so similar, and because Serum Life Sciences is the \"cornerstone\" investor for Sareum, this filing automatically triggered alerts for almost every Sareum shareholder. 2. Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",

The BoD, via the Annual Statement have stated the proposed strategy and as you state a successful Toxicity Study is the key, the stages of achieving that are clear and hopefully will be in the timelines mentioned. In the meantime, SRA737 may have a potential worth which is outside the above and may bring \u201csomething\u201d to the table! If there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t get my head around, it is TM going \u201cpart time\u201d at such a crucial stage of Sareum\u2019s development - get him stepping away from CEO but the \u201cScience\u201d ??

As a biotech minnow, they just don't have the resources needed for a full scale marketing strategy. Also, Sareums pipeline isn't developed enough for Parker to start kicking in doors and demanding a seat at the table.  The strategic shift from phase 1b to an extended Tox study put the company on path, they now must complete before a deal is made. That would have been fine but it didn't pan out on the first attempt.  Complacency, incompetence or just bad luck.  It doesn't matter now.  We will lose a year and that is that. The other big problem I see here is the disparity between what the board tell us and what we believe will happen.   It kind of started with Thoth, and we loved him for it.  Knowledgeable posts giving believable timescales with some not quite believable outcomes. Pre COVID, I too thought we might get a 2 billion buyout at phase 1.  In reality it was never going to happen. It might never happen and there is a good chance that the all time highs of 2021 were about as good as it gets for Sareum shareholders. Like I said.  The ex Tox study is now a strategy that must be completed before a deal is done. And because of that, Parker hasn't really got anything to sell.  He can have the conversations, maybe generate some interest but he will need a clean Tox study before any negotiations start.   So we wait. JR said 6 months minimum and I suspect SAR being SAR, they will need more than that. I'm not happy about the delays, some of them were probably avoidable and by my own count.  I reckon we are around 3 years behind where we should be if everything went to plan post 2018.   But for now, I'm happy with what the board is doing. Hopefully, the Tox study is successful and we will see some shareholder value creep back in.",

Going back to one of potnaks comments. I think I have said consistently that I have 80,0000 shares , I am about 50% down so lets say 40p break even. I have been in this share probably about 15 years  ,so 50p is not a return for me. The reason I stay in is I dont want to sell at a loss and the journey is not apparently to an end. Like most on this board we have traded a bit and made some money, we have accumulated when we can although to be fair I dropped my holding to buy in a gold mining company with intention of making profit and putting more into sareum. Im covered for pension pretty much , so sareum will determine if my retirement is no frills, good, or very good",

You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share.

          "content": "Utar. I'm not sure why you are here, if you think that.  Can I ask. When you stopped posting here, did you sell up and recently buy back in? You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share. That could be within a year.",

What do you want them to make a deal with.  The board made (were advised) to run an extended Toxicology study instead of a p1b trial. This in theory, if successful, would add value as the compound is effectively phase 2 ready. 1802 and possibly the new cns compounds are waiting on the results of the Tox study. For 737. I'm convinced that it the patent life, 7 years and counting.  It could take half of that to get into phase 3. So, with the above.  What is there to sell?

Presumably, they are similar enough that 1801 validates 1802 safety profile so the planned on licence should be fairly easy.  So we could see 2 deals close together or one bigger deal for both? Im expecting anything major for 737.  Maybe a commitment from a third party to pay for a combo trial and maybe an extended patent for combo use. CNS.  Still very early days but a successful Tox study and safety profile for 1801 will, hopefully give us a nice little package to push into a licence deal. IMO - it wouldn't matter who was running the company.  Without unlimited funds,  we need to wait for the Tox study to complete and based on experience, there is a good chance were not even close to starting it yet. The P1 trial data is just fluff.  It might generate some action here but the market will want tangible news. So where would a HNWI change things?",

          "content": "From AI: The Form 8.3 was filed by Serum Life Sciences Limited. \u2022 Who they are: They are a major investment arm of the Serum Institute of India and hold a ~14.2% stake in Sareum. \u2022 What they filed: Today\u2019s form was actually a disclosure of their 3.12% interest in Oxford Biomedica plc, which is currently in a takeover \"offer period.\" Because the names Serum and Sareum are so similar, and because Serum Life Sciences is the \"cornerstone\" investor for Sareum, this filing automatically triggered alerts for almost every Sareum shareholder. 2. Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",

CHEK1 Expression Correlates with Tumor Progression in Lung Adenocarcinoma but Not in Squamous Cell Carcinoma https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/62/2/335 \"In conclusion, our study demonstrates that CHEK1 expression serves as a distinct prognostic biomarker specifically for LUAD, but not for SCC. We identified that high CHEK1 expression in AD is significantly correlated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, high CHEK1 levels were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with AD, highlighting its potential utility in stratifying high-risk patients. These findings suggest that CHEK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for adenocarcinoma, particularly in younger patients or those with aggressive disease features. Clinically, CHEK1 expression may serve as a useful biomarker to identify high-risk AD patients who could benefit from intensified surveillance or emerging CHEK1-targeted therapies. Future studies should focus on validating these findings at the protein level and exploring the efficacy of CHEK1 inhibitors in biomarker-defined AD data.\" 2. Pfizer-backed Priovant scores again with fast-rising brepocitinib in midstage study: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-backed-priovant-scores-again-fast-rising-brepocitinib-mid-stage-study \"As Priovant works toward approval of potential blockbuster brepocitinib as a treatment for dermatomyositis, the North Carolina biotech has presented promising results for the TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor in another rare skin condition. A phase 2 study evaluating brepocitinib in patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS) has become the first industry-sponsored, placebo-controlled trial to generate a positive readout in the indication, according to Priovant. And, based on the results, Priovant plans to initiate a phase 3 study this year, after consultation with the FDA, the four-year-old company said. The Beacon trial enrolled 31 patients, randomizing them at a rate of 3:2:2 to receive a daily 45-mg oral dose of brepocitinib, a 15-mg daily dose or placebo for 16 weeks. The 45-mg arm achieved a 100% response rate in multiple endpoints. While patients in the placebo group achieved close to no benefit, those in the 15-mg arm \u201cimproved considerably, with numerically similar improvement to the 45 mg arm on lower-bar endpoints,\u201d Priovant said. There also was evidence of dose-dependent benefit seen on higher-bar endpoints, the biotech added.\" PS. Cheers Num4, its hard to give up ones habits! ATVB",

They took back 737 and have done bu***** all with it. Let's face - 2025 was not a year to be proud of. RNS, 1st July 2024: Positive Data from SDC-1801 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Cambridge, UK, 1 July 2024 - Sareum Holdings plc (AIM: SAR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer, is pleased to announce positive topline data from its Phase 1a clinical trial of SDC-1801, a dual TYK2/JAK1 kinase inhibitor being developed as a potential new therapeutic for a range of autoimmune diseases. Following the dosing of the final cohort in the Multiple Ascending Dose stage of the trial, and review of the initial data by the Safety Review Committee, the Company reports that: \u00b7 Blood plasma levels of SDC-1801 significantly in excess of the predicted therapeutic exposure were achieved, with a half-life of between 17 and 20 hours observed, which suggests that once-daily dosing will be possible* \u00b7 No deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported \u00b7 Although data remains blinded, there appear to be no significant changes in blood cell counts or increases in serum creatinine levels, which may be dose limiting side-effects of brepocitinib, currently the most advanced TYK2/JAK1 dual inhibitor *Half-life is an estimation of the time it takes for an initial concentration of SDC-1801 to be reduced by half in the body. The Company expects that further data, unblinded from drug/placebo recipients, including details of any mild or moderate adverse events and biomarkers of TYK2 and/or JAK1 inhibition, will be available in Q3 2024.",

Yes there is frustration, but, do some really believe the BoD screwed up the Toxicity Studies deliberately, just to grab some more salary ( and note as yet no bonuses declared for last year ). As an attendee at the AGM, I heard the BoD\u2019s own frustrations, the proposals to rectify,  advancement on other parts of the business and their \u201cintended\u201dtimelines to achieve - all during the progressive course of this year 2026 - when I look at the calendar, we are currently in week 6 of 52, not even halfway through Q1! To date, the Chairman has posted a report (communication) reiterating the information provided in the Annual Statement- those who care to read it will understand where we are as a Company, google AI and it will tell you the same, no slandering of the BoD - just the risk of a bio tech investment. For me, a pathway has been laid out after a very frustrating period, I await the progress as and when achieved (as it can't be made up to pamper the noise) and hopefully it leads to increased sp revaluation that was the intention when I invested. Still 7 weeks of Q1 left for an update on any one of our \u201ccurrent\u201d 4 compounds - my bet is still on the table! Have a good day! GLA",

However, there will be no assumptions made when/if a deal is negotiated.  The boards commercial ability hasn't been tested yet, or at least, we haven't seen the results yet.  I will ask again, what do you think a replacement board would do differently? With 1801, we have the equivalent of a house that has just had a really bad survey come back or a car that has just failed it's mot.  We've just found out the the testing centre was at fault which is encouraging but the buyer is obviously nervous and wants the test to be run again before negotiating the cost to buy. I dont know if 1801 is good but I can think critically and I know the boards hands are tied until they have good data from the tox study.  I suspect they will need to wait until it completes fully.  So if it start on the next week or do. End of Q3 or beginning of Q4.  But I said that last October when we got the RNS. You have your opinion, that's great but maybe work through some other scenarios in your head too.   I have been critical of the board before but in this case.  They don't yet have any thing they can do a deal with. No one would.",

A fun exercise netherless.  Anyway, here it is. From a skeptical perspective, the \"Christmas Conspiracy\" is most likely a coincidence of standard year-end fiscal housekeeping rather than a strategic masterplan, and the mention of Jacobio in the patent is typical defensive legal drafting (\"kitchen-sinking\") rather than evidence of a handshake. Fundamentally, SRA737 has now been deprioritised by three separate entities (Sierra, GSK, and the US partner) despite full access to the data, which suggests that the asset carries hidden commercial or toxicity risks that outweigh its theoretical value. When combined with a drug class (BET inhibitors) that has historically failed in the clinic and a looming 2033 patent cliff that severely limits future profits, the objective conclusion is that the asset was returned simply because the financial case for developing it no longer stacks up for a major partner.",

Here are some suspicious timeline re 737 and patent filings Investors often ask: \"Why did the US partner return SRA737 in Dec 2024?\" The answer might be in the IP filings. \u200bHere is the timeline that suggests a strategic alignment for a major deal. \u200bThe Setup (Feb 2023): Shortly after SRA737 becomes available, a patent is filed in Europe protecting the combination of Jacobio's JAB-8263 (BET) + Chk1 Inhibitors. Someone was already ring-fencing the strategy.Someone \u200bThe Trigger (Dec 25, 2024): This patent (EP4480494) is finally published. The specific claim to use Jacobio\u2019s drug with a Chk1 inhibitor becomes public knowledge. \u200bThe Reaction (Dec 26, 2024): 24 hours later, Sareum\u2019s US partner terminates their deal. Likely realising the commercial path was now blocked or reserved for a specific player. \u200bThe Payoff (Jan 2026): AstraZeneca announces a strategic partnership with Jacobio. \u200bConclusion: Sareum has reacquired SRA737 with improved economics (63.5%) exactly when the intended partner (Jacobio) has secured the funding (AZ) to execute the plan filed in the patent.",

          "content": "Gone down the rabbit hole with this.  Got a little AI agent traveling the net and reporting back.  May not be sra737 but they getting trying to patent the chk\\bet combo. Based on the patent document EP4480494A1 (published in late December 2024), here is the summary of the \"Who, Why, What, and When.\" \u200bThe Patent: EP4480494A1 When: \u200bPublished: December 25, 2024 (Christmas Day). \u200bStatus: Active Application (European Patent Office). \u200bFiling Date: Likely mid-2023 (based on standard 18-month publication lag), meaning this strategy was formulated before the recent AstraZeneca/Jacobio news. \u200bWhat (The Content): \u200bThe Claim: It outlines a \"Combination Therapy\" for treating advanced tumours (specifically mentioning breast cancer and solid tumours). \u200bThe Recipe: It explicitly claims the use of a BET Inhibitor combined with a Wee1 or Chk1 Inhibitor. \u200bThe \"Jacobio\" Connection: Crucially, the patent text does not just say \"any BET inhibitor.\" It explicitly lists JAB-8263 (Jacobio\u2019s drug) alongside SYHA-1801 (CSPC\u2019s drug) as specific, preferred versions of the BET inhibitor to be used in this combination. \u200bWhy (The Strategy): \u200bThe Problem: BET inhibitors (like JAB-8263) are effective but often trigger resistance mechanisms where the cancer cell repairs itself. \u200bThe Solution: Adding a Chk1 inhibitor stops that repair. \u200bThe Objective: This patent is a \"Land Grab.\" The filer is trying to legally own the method of combining these two specific drug classes before the clinical trials officially start. By naming JAB-8263, they are specifically ring-fencing the use of Jacobio\u2019s asset in this context. Who (The Applicant): \u200bWhile the specific applicant name is often obscured in initial snippet views (or held by a holding entity), the inclusion of SYHA-1801 (owned by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group) alongside JAB-8263 suggests this filing likely originated from the Chinese Pharma ecosystem (possibly CSPC itself or a major research institute). \u200bSignificance: Recall that CSPC is the other major partner AstraZeneca just signed a deal with. This suggests that the players in AstraZeneca\u2019s new \"China Circle\" (CSPC and Jacobio) are already actively patenting these combinations. \u200bSummary for Investors\u000b\u000b \u200bThis patent is proof of intent. It shows that as recently as December 2024, the pharmaceutical industry was actively filing legal paperwork to protect the exact combination (BET + Chk1) that Sareum\u2019s SRA737 facilitates. The fact that they specifically wrote \"JAB-8263\" into the document confirms that Jacobio's drug is viewed as a prime candidate for this mechanism.",

Would you have over the cash or would you wait for the results of another survey.",

The BoD, via the Annual Statement have stated the proposed strategy and as you state a successful Toxicity Study is the key, the stages of achieving that are clear and hopefully will be in the timelines mentioned. In the meantime, SRA737 may have a potential worth which is outside the above and may bring \u201csomething\u201d to the table! If there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t get my head around, it is TM going \u201cpart time\u201d at such a crucial stage of Sareum\u2019s development - get him stepping away from CEO but the \u201cScience\u201d ??

As a biotech minnow, they just don't have the resources needed for a full scale marketing strategy. Also, Sareums pipeline isn't developed enough for Parker to start kicking in doors and demanding a seat at the table.  The strategic shift from phase 1b to an extended Tox study put the company on path, they now must complete before a deal is made. That would have been fine but it didn't pan out on the first attempt.  Complacency, incompetence or just bad luck.  It doesn't matter now.  We will lose a year and that is that. The other big problem I see here is the disparity between what the board tell us and what we believe will happen.   It kind of started with Thoth, and we loved him for it.  Knowledgeable posts giving believable timescales with some not quite believable outcomes. Pre COVID, I too thought we might get a 2 billion buyout at phase 1.  In reality it was never going to happen. It might never happen and there is a good chance that the all time highs of 2021 were about as good as it gets for Sareum shareholders. Like I said.  The ex Tox study is now a strategy that must be completed before a deal is done. And because of that, Parker hasn't really got anything to sell.  He can have the conversations, maybe generate some interest but he will need a clean Tox study before any negotiations start.   So we wait. JR said 6 months minimum and I suspect SAR being SAR, they will need more than that. I'm not happy about the delays, some of them were probably avoidable and by my own count.  I reckon we are around 3 years behind where we should be if everything went to plan post 2018.   But for now, I'm happy with what the board is doing. Hopefully, the Tox study is successful and we will see some shareholder value creep back in.",

Going back to one of potnaks comments. I think I have said consistently that I have 80,0000 shares , I am about 50% down so lets say 40p break even. I have been in this share probably about 15 years  ,so 50p is not a return for me. The reason I stay in is I dont want to sell at a loss and the journey is not apparently to an end. Like most on this board we have traded a bit and made some money, we have accumulated when we can although to be fair I dropped my holding to buy in a gold mining company with intention of making profit and putting more into sareum. Im covered for pension pretty much , so sareum will determine if my retirement is no frills, good, or very good",

You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share.

          "content": "Utar. I'm not sure why you are here, if you think that.  Can I ask. When you stopped posting here, did you sell up and recently buy back in? You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share. That could be within a year.",

What do you want them to make a deal with.  The board made (were advised) to run an extended Toxicology study instead of a p1b trial. This in theory, if successful, would add value as the compound is effectively phase 2 ready. 1802 and possibly the new cns compounds are waiting on the results of the Tox study. For 737. I'm convinced that it the patent life, 7 years and counting.  It could take half of that to get into phase 3. So, with the above.  What is there to sell?

Presumably, they are similar enough that 1801 validates 1802 safety profile so the planned on licence should be fairly easy.  So we could see 2 deals close together or one bigger deal for both? Im expecting anything major for 737.  Maybe a commitment from a third party to pay for a combo trial and maybe an extended patent for combo use. CNS.  Still very early days but a successful Tox study and safety profile for 1801 will, hopefully give us a nice little package to push into a licence deal. IMO - it wouldn't matter who was running the company.  Without unlimited funds,  we need to wait for the Tox study to complete and based on experience, there is a good chance were not even close to starting it yet. The P1 trial data is just fluff.  It might generate some action here but the market will want tangible news. So where would a HNWI change things?",

Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",

The only way you could do this legally and stay under the radar is to instruct your broker to keep buying small amounts in separate small orders.  A TR1 must be notified within 2 days in both cases.  You'd need, well over 3 million shares for a TR1.  Even if you could buy 300k shares everyday, you'd need 10 solid days to get there. The rules are complicated and I've never really understood them but MM's can hold shares overnight but the risk is high. They could gap down and they'd be holding shares that are worth less than they purchased them for. Long post to basically say.  It's just the MM's trying to make a market.",

We identified that high CHEK1 expression in AD is significantly correlated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, high CHEK1 levels were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with AD, highlighting its potential utility in stratifying high-risk patients. These findings suggest that CHEK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for adenocarcinoma, particularly in younger patients or those with aggressive disease features. Clinically, CHEK1 expression may serve as a useful biomarker to identify high-risk AD patients who could benefit from intensified surveillance or emerging CHEK1-targeted therapies. Future studies should focus on validating these findings at the protein level and exploring the efficacy of CHEK1 inhibitors in biomarker-defined AD data.\" 2.

A phase 2 study evaluating brepocitinib in patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS) has become the first industry-sponsored, placebo-controlled trial to generate a positive readout in the indication, according to Priovant. And, based on the results, Priovant plans to initiate a phase 3 study this year, after consultation with the FDA, the four-year-old company said. The Beacon trial enrolled 31 patients, randomizing them at a rate of 3:2:2 to receive a daily 45-mg oral dose of brepocitinib, a 15-mg daily dose or placebo for 16 weeks. The 45-mg arm achieved a 100% response rate in multiple endpoints. While patients in the placebo group achieved close to no benefit, those in the 15-mg arm \u201cimproved considerably, with numerically similar improvement to the 45 mg arm on lower-bar endpoints,\u201d Priovant said.

Ahead of this, a short pharmacokinetic study has evaluated different formulations to help optimise the full toxicology study. In parallel, work to optimise the capsule formulation is progressing, with the aim of improving drug release and reducing the number of capsules required in future clinical studies\u201d If I reading it correctly it says \u201chas\u201d on the initial pharmacokinetic test, which would confirm this has been completed and therefore the next news should be the trial has restarted after they have optimised the capsules Frustrating as always whilst awaiting news but we slowly moving in the right direction I hope",

          "content": "I do think the 2025 AGM update was wholly disingenuous when it came to \"we've got great news from our phase 1 clinical trial.\" For those that had forgotten, plus the BoD, they released the following RNS on 1st July 2024(!). A successful clinical trial was conducted in 2023 and 2024. 2025 was all about clicking send on the final report - it's hardly a great achievement for the year. 2025 was the year of the failed tox study. They took back 737 and have done bu***** all with it. Let's face - 2025 was not a year to be proud of. RNS, 1st July 2024: Positive Data from SDC-1801 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Cambridge, UK, 1 July 2024 - Sareum Holdings plc (AIM: SAR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer, is pleased to announce positive topline data from its Phase 1a clinical trial of SDC-1801, a dual TYK2/JAK1 kinase inhibitor being developed as a potential new therapeutic for a range of autoimmune diseases. Following the dosing of the final cohort in the Multiple Ascending Dose stage of the trial, and review of the initial data by the Safety Review Committee, the Company reports that: \u00b7 Blood plasma levels of SDC-1801 significantly in excess of the predicted therapeutic exposure were achieved, with a half-life of between 17 and 20 hours observed, which suggests that once-daily dosing will be possible* \u00b7 No deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported \u00b7 Although data remains blinded, there appear to be no significant changes in blood cell counts or increases in serum creatinine levels, which may be dose limiting side-effects of brepocitinib, currently the most advanced TYK2/JAK1 dual inhibitor *Half-life is an estimation of the time it takes for an initial concentration of SDC-1801 to be reduced by half in the body. The Company expects that further data, unblinded from drug/placebo recipients, including details of any mild or moderate adverse events and biomarkers of TYK2 and/or JAK1 inhibition, will be available in Q3 2024.",

Yes there is frustration, but, do some really believe the BoD screwed up the Toxicity Studies deliberately, just to grab some more salary ( and note as yet no bonuses declared for last year ). As an attendee at the AGM, I heard the BoD\u2019s own frustrations, the proposals to rectify,  advancement on other parts of the business and their \u201cintended\u201dtimelines to achieve - all during the progressive course of this year 2026 - when I look at the calendar, we are currently in week 6 of 52, not even halfway through Q1! To date, the Chairman has posted a report (communication) reiterating the information provided in the Annual Statement- those who care to read it will understand where we are as a Company, google AI and it will tell you the same, no slandering of the BoD - just the risk of a bio tech investment. For me, a pathway has been laid out after a very frustrating period, I await the progress as and when achieved (as it can't be made up to pamper the noise) and hopefully it leads to increased sp revaluation that was the intention when I invested. Still 7 weeks of Q1 left for an update on any one of our \u201ccurrent\u201d 4 compounds - my bet is still on the table! Have a good day! GLA",

However, there will be no assumptions made when/if a deal is negotiated.  The boards commercial ability hasn't been tested yet, or at least, we haven't seen the results yet.  I will ask again, what do you think a replacement board would do differently? With 1801, we have the equivalent of a house that has just had a really bad survey come back or a car that has just failed it's mot.  We've just found out the the testing centre was at fault which is encouraging but the buyer is obviously nervous and wants the test to be run again before negotiating the cost to buy. I dont know if 1801 is good but I can think critically and I know the boards hands are tied until they have good data from the tox study.  I suspect they will need to wait until it completes fully.  So if it start on the next week or do. End of Q3 or beginning of Q4.  But I said that last October when we got the RNS. You have your opinion, that's great but maybe work through some other scenarios in your head too.   I have been critical of the board before but in this case.  They don't yet have any thing they can do a deal with. No one would.",

A fun exercise netherless.  Anyway, here it is. From a skeptical perspective, the \"Christmas Conspiracy\" is most likely a coincidence of standard year-end fiscal housekeeping rather than a strategic masterplan, and the mention of Jacobio in the patent is typical defensive legal drafting (\"kitchen-sinking\") rather than evidence of a handshake. Fundamentally, SRA737 has now been deprioritised by three separate entities (Sierra, GSK, and the US partner) despite full access to the data, which suggests that the asset carries hidden commercial or toxicity risks that outweigh its theoretical value. When combined with a drug class (BET inhibitors) that has historically failed in the clinic and a looming 2033 patent cliff that severely limits future profits, the objective conclusion is that the asset was returned simply because the financial case for developing it no longer stacks up for a major partner.",

Here are some suspicious timeline re 737 and patent filings Investors often ask: \"Why did the US partner return SRA737 in Dec 2024?\" The answer might be in the IP filings. \u200bHere is the timeline that suggests a strategic alignment for a major deal. \u200bThe Setup (Feb 2023): Shortly after SRA737 becomes available, a patent is filed in Europe protecting the combination of Jacobio's JAB-8263 (BET) + Chk1 Inhibitors. Someone was already ring-fencing the strategy.Someone \u200bThe Trigger (Dec 25, 2024): This patent (EP4480494) is finally published. The specific claim to use Jacobio\u2019s drug with a Chk1 inhibitor becomes public knowledge. \u200bThe Reaction (Dec 26, 2024): 24 hours later, Sareum\u2019s US partner terminates their deal. Likely realising the commercial path was now blocked or reserved for a specific player. \u200bThe Payoff (Jan 2026): AstraZeneca announces a strategic partnership with Jacobio. \u200bConclusion: Sareum has reacquired SRA737 with improved economics (63.5%) exactly when the intended partner (Jacobio) has secured the funding (AZ) to execute the plan filed in the patent.",

          "content": "Gone down the rabbit hole with this.  Got a little AI agent traveling the net and reporting back.  May not be sra737 but they getting trying to patent the chk\\bet combo. Based on the patent document EP4480494A1 (published in late December 2024), here is the summary of the \"Who, Why, What, and When.\" \u200bThe Patent: EP4480494A1 When: \u200bPublished: December 25, 2024 (Christmas Day). \u200bStatus: Active Application (European Patent Office). \u200bFiling Date: Likely mid-2023 (based on standard 18-month publication lag), meaning this strategy was formulated before the recent AstraZeneca/Jacobio news. \u200bWhat (The Content): \u200bThe Claim: It outlines a \"Combination Therapy\" for treating advanced tumours (specifically mentioning breast cancer and solid tumours). \u200bThe Recipe: It explicitly claims the use of a BET Inhibitor combined with a Wee1 or Chk1 Inhibitor. \u200bThe \"Jacobio\" Connection: Crucially, the patent text does not just say \"any BET inhibitor.\" It explicitly lists JAB-8263 (Jacobio\u2019s drug) alongside SYHA-1801 (CSPC\u2019s drug) as specific, preferred versions of the BET inhibitor to be used in this combination. \u200bWhy (The Strategy): \u200bThe Problem: BET inhibitors (like JAB-8263) are effective but often trigger resistance mechanisms where the cancer cell repairs itself. \u200bThe Solution: Adding a Chk1 inhibitor stops that repair. \u200bThe Objective: This patent is a \"Land Grab.\" The filer is trying to legally own the method of combining these two specific drug classes before the clinical trials officially start. By naming JAB-8263, they are specifically ring-fencing the use of Jacobio\u2019s asset in this context. Who (The Applicant): \u200bWhile the specific applicant name is often obscured in initial snippet views (or held by a holding entity), the inclusion of SYHA-1801 (owned by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group) alongside JAB-8263 suggests this filing likely originated from the Chinese Pharma ecosystem (possibly CSPC itself or a major research institute). \u200bSignificance: Recall that CSPC is the other major partner AstraZeneca just signed a deal with. This suggests that the players in AstraZeneca\u2019s new \"China Circle\" (CSPC and Jacobio) are already actively patenting these combinations. \u200bSummary for Investors\u000b\u000b \u200bThis patent is proof of intent. It shows that as recently as December 2024, the pharmaceutical industry was actively filing legal paperwork to protect the exact combination (BET + Chk1) that Sareum\u2019s SRA737 facilitates. The fact that they specifically wrote \"JAB-8263\" into the document confirms that Jacobio's drug is viewed as a prime candidate for this mechanism.",

I don't see Sareum having much of a strong hand atm and holding out will have to be balanced against diminishing resources following satisfactory tox results. The time delay involved in actually publishing the results won't help. If we were offered anything north of 50p, I think shareholders would agree. Most will just want their money back.",

The BoD, via the Annual Statement have stated the proposed strategy and as you state a successful Toxicity Study is the key, the stages of achieving that are clear and hopefully will be in the timelines mentioned. In the meantime, SRA737 may have a potential worth which is outside the above and may bring \u201csomething\u201d to the table! If there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t get my head around, it is TM going \u201cpart time\u201d at such a crucial stage of Sareum\u2019s development - get him stepping away from CEO but the \u201cScience\u201d ??

As a biotech minnow, they just don't have the resources needed for a full scale marketing strategy. Also, Sareums pipeline isn't developed enough for Parker to start kicking in doors and demanding a seat at the table.  The strategic shift from phase 1b to an extended Tox study put the company on path, they now must complete before a deal is made. That would have been fine but it didn't pan out on the first attempt.  Complacency, incompetence or just bad luck.  It doesn't matter now.  We will lose a year and that is that. The other big problem I see here is the disparity between what the board tell us and what we believe will happen.   It kind of started with Thoth, and we loved him for it.  Knowledgeable posts giving believable timescales with some not quite believable outcomes. Pre COVID, I too thought we might get a 2 billion buyout at phase 1.  In reality it was never going to happen. It might never happen and there is a good chance that the all time highs of 2021 were about as good as it gets for Sareum shareholders. Like I said.  The ex Tox study is now a strategy that must be completed before a deal is done. And because of that, Parker hasn't really got anything to sell.  He can have the conversations, maybe generate some interest but he will need a clean Tox study before any negotiations start.   So we wait. JR said 6 months minimum and I suspect SAR being SAR, they will need more than that. I'm not happy about the delays, some of them were probably avoidable and by my own count.  I reckon we are around 3 years behind where we should be if everything went to plan post 2018.   But for now, I'm happy with what the board is doing. Hopefully, the Tox study is successful and we will see some shareholder value creep back in.",

Going back to one of potnaks comments. I think I have said consistently that I have 80,0000 shares , I am about 50% down so lets say 40p break even. I have been in this share probably about 15 years  ,so 50p is not a return for me. The reason I stay in is I dont want to sell at a loss and the journey is not apparently to an end. Like most on this board we have traded a bit and made some money, we have accumulated when we can although to be fair I dropped my holding to buy in a gold mining company with intention of making profit and putting more into sareum. Im covered for pension pretty much , so sareum will determine if my retirement is no frills, good, or very good",

You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share.

A death spiral finance deal that nearly finished them which resulted in a massive share dilution.  The value for shareholders is non existent. For those saying the board can't make a deal. What do you want them to make a deal with.  The board made (were advised) to run an extended Toxicology study instead of a p1b trial. This in theory, if successful, would add value as the compound is effectively phase 2 ready. 1802 and possibly the new cns compounds are waiting on the results of the Tox study. For 737. I'm convinced that it the patent life, 7 years and counting.  It could take half of that to get into phase 3. So, with the above.  What is there to sell? As always, we need to wait but at today price. You could purchase a potential multi bagger for peanuts. We'll know by the end of this year.",

Presumably, they are similar enough that 1801 validates 1802 safety profile so the planned on licence should be fairly easy.  So we could see 2 deals close together or one bigger deal for both? Im expecting anything major for 737.  Maybe a commitment from a third party to pay for a combo trial and maybe an extended patent for combo use. CNS.  Still very early days but a successful Tox study and safety profile for 1801 will, hopefully give us a nice little package to push into a licence deal. IMO - it wouldn't matter who was running the company.  Without unlimited funds,  we need to wait for the Tox study to complete and based on experience, there is a good chance were not even close to starting it yet. The P1 trial data is just fluff.  It might generate some action here but the market will want tangible news. So where would a HNWI change things?",

Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",

In this case there could be a few buy orders in waiting for a low price so the order is offered, waiting on bailiff to sell.  When the stock is liquid, an analyst can see the order book and can manipulate the orders to 'maje a market'. There is no way of knowing how many orders are sat waiting to be filled.

If a UK investor we see a TR-1 over 3% and if an overseas investment investor the TR-1 would trigger at 5%. As Potnak points out, that\u2019s a lot of shares. My point was that if another pharmaceutical company wanted to take a stake it could do so quite cheaply- throwing another hand grenade into the mix by asking you all to consider when accumulating, any pharma may well have other Ltd companies they could also use to accumulate a separate percentage using the same methodology. Once all in the open, news is released and said pharma sells down to part fund any deal or is content to stake build. Just some additional speculation whilst we wait for DP64\u2019s HNWI to sort us out!",

Then the broker keeps buying, say 10k at a time so not to spook the market.  The buyer eventually gets half million shares for 17p but We would see them in the daily volume. Happy to be schooled on this but there are rules designed to stop this scenario.  Anyone can accumulate over days of even weeks but we would see the historical volume. We saw this a lot when RF were offloading their shares.  3 or 400k everyday until All were sold.   All with with matching volume of buys. I suppose someone could try selling 400k shares.  See if it is reported.",

That started on the day of the IM call.  Then is was Christmas.  We're only 6 weeks into this quarter and we did get a \"chairman's corner\" update.  These might not seem much and are not a regulatory requirement but they are a way to show, that everything is on track. You asked when I would get concerned. Depends, but if we got another chairman's corner this month. Then I guess mid march might become a bit tense.  In terms of 737 and the bio industry.  AACR is in April  and ASCO is May\\June.   It would be a shame if 737 doesn't get a mention at both these events but that would depend on the path the board are taking with this compound.",

CHEK1 Expression Correlates with Tumor Progression in Lung Adenocarcinoma but Not in Squamous Cell Carcinoma https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/62/2/335 \"In conclusion, our study demonstrates that CHEK1 expression serves as a distinct prognostic biomarker specifically for LUAD, but not for SCC. We identified that high CHEK1 expression in AD is significantly correlated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, high CHEK1 levels were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with AD, highlighting its potential utility in stratifying high-risk patients. These findings suggest that CHEK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for adenocarcinoma, particularly in younger patients or those with aggressive disease features. Clinically, CHEK1 expression may serve as a useful biomarker to identify high-risk AD patients who could benefit from intensified surveillance or emerging CHEK1-targeted therapies. Future studies should focus on validating these findings at the protein level and exploring the efficacy of CHEK1 inhibitors in biomarker-defined AD data.\" 2. Pfizer-backed Priovant scores again with fast-rising brepocitinib in midstage study: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-backed-priovant-scores-again-fast-rising-brepocitinib-mid-stage-study \"As Priovant works toward approval of potential blockbuster brepocitinib as a treatment for dermatomyositis, the North Carolina biotech has presented promising results for the TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor in another rare skin condition. A phase 2 study evaluating brepocitinib in patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS) has become the first industry-sponsored, placebo-controlled trial to generate a positive readout in the indication, according to Priovant. And, based on the results, Priovant plans to initiate a phase 3 study this year, after consultation with the FDA, the four-year-old company said. The Beacon trial enrolled 31 patients, randomizing them at a rate of 3:2:2 to receive a daily 45-mg oral dose of brepocitinib, a 15-mg daily dose or placebo for 16 weeks. The 45-mg arm achieved a 100% response rate in multiple endpoints. While patients in the placebo group achieved close to no benefit, those in the 15-mg arm \u201cimproved considerably, with numerically similar improvement to the 45 mg arm on lower-bar endpoints,\u201d Priovant said. There also was evidence of dose-dependent benefit seen on higher-bar endpoints, the biotech added.\" PS. Cheers Num4, its hard to give up ones habits! ATVB",

CHEK1 Expression Correlates with Tumor Progression in Lung Adenocarcinoma but Not in Squamous Cell Carcinoma https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/62/2/335 \"In conclusion, our study demonstrates that CHEK1 expression serves as a distinct prognostic biomarker specifically for LUAD, but not for SCC. We identified that high CHEK1 expression in AD is significantly correlated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, high CHEK1 levels were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with AD, highlighting its potential utility in stratifying high-risk patients. These findings suggest that CHEK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for adenocarcinoma, particularly in younger patients or those with aggressive disease features. Clinically, CHEK1 expression may serve as a useful biomarker to identify high-risk AD patients who could benefit from intensified surveillance or emerging CHEK1-targeted therapies. Future studies should focus on validating these findings at the protein level and exploring the efficacy of CHEK1 inhibitors in biomarker-defined AD data.\" 2. Pfizer-backed Priovant scores again with fast-rising brepocitinib in midstage study: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-backed-priovant-scores-again-fast-rising-brepocitinib-mid-stage-study \"As Priovant works toward approval of potential blockbuster brepocitinib as a treatment for dermatomyositis, the North Carolina biotech has presented promising results for the TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor in another rare skin condition. A phase 2 study evaluating brepocitinib in patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS) has become the first industry-sponsored, placebo-controlled trial to generate a positive readout in the indication, according to Priovant. And, based on the results, Priovant plans to initiate a phase 3 study this year, after consultation with the FDA, the four-year-old company said. The Beacon trial enrolled 31 patients, randomizing them at a rate of 3:2:2 to receive a daily 45-mg oral dose of brepocitinib, a 15-mg daily dose or placebo for 16 weeks. The 45-mg arm achieved a 100% response rate in multiple endpoints. While patients in the placebo group achieved close to no benefit, those in the 15-mg arm \u201cimproved considerably, with numerically similar improvement to the 45 mg arm on lower-bar endpoints,\u201d Priovant said. There also was evidence of dose-dependent benefit seen on higher-bar endpoints, the biotech added.\" PS. Cheers Num4, its hard to give up ones habits! ATVB",

A successful clinical trial was conducted in 2023 and 2024. 2025 was all about clicking send on the final report - it's hardly a great achievement for the year. 2025 was the year of the failed tox study. They took back 737 and have done bu***** all with it. Let's face - 2025 was not a year to be proud of. RNS, 1st July 2024: Positive Data from SDC-1801 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Cambridge, UK, 1 July 2024 - Sareum Holdings plc (AIM: SAR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer, is pleased to announce positive topline data from its Phase 1a clinical trial of SDC-1801, a dual TYK2/JAK1 kinase inhibitor being developed as a potential new therapeutic for a range of autoimmune diseases. Following the dosing of the final cohort in the Multiple Ascending Dose stage of the trial, and review of the initial data by the Safety Review Committee, the Company reports that: \u00b7 Blood plasma levels of SDC-1801 significantly in excess of the predicted therapeutic exposure were achieved, with a half-life of between 17 and 20 hours observed, which suggests that once-daily dosing will be possible* \u00b7 No deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported \u00b7 Although data remains blinded, there appear to be no significant changes in blood cell counts or increases in serum creatinine levels, which may be dose limiting side-effects of brepocitinib, currently the most advanced TYK2/JAK1 dual inhibitor *Half-life is an estimation of the time it takes for an initial concentration of SDC-1801 to be reduced by half in the body. The Company expects that further data, unblinded from drug/placebo recipients, including details of any mild or moderate adverse events and biomarkers of TYK2 and/or JAK1 inhibition, will be available in Q3 2024.",

However, there will be no assumptions made when/if a deal is negotiated.  The boards commercial ability hasn't been tested yet, or at least, we haven't seen the results yet.  I will ask again, what do you think a replacement board would do differently? With 1801, we have the equivalent of a house that has just had a really bad survey come back or a car that has just failed it's mot.  We've just found out the the testing centre was at fault which is encouraging but the buyer is obviously nervous and wants the test to be run again before negotiating the cost to buy. I dont know if 1801 is good but I can think critically and I know the boards hands are tied until they have good data from the tox study.  I suspect they will need to wait until it completes fully.  So if it start on the next week or do. End of Q3 or beginning of Q4.  But I said that last October when we got the RNS. You have your opinion, that's great but maybe work through some other scenarios in your head too.   I have been critical of the board before but in this case.  They don't yet have any thing they can do a deal with. No one would.",

I strongly believe that this Trio will not sign any contract other than looking after their salary, pension and bonus.  Just a simple question at what ground they could ask for a bonus???????",

A fun exercise netherless.  Anyway, here it is. From a skeptical perspective, the \"Christmas Conspiracy\" is most likely a coincidence of standard year-end fiscal housekeeping rather than a strategic masterplan, and the mention of Jacobio in the patent is typical defensive legal drafting (\"kitchen-sinking\") rather than evidence of a handshake. Fundamentally, SRA737 has now been deprioritised by three separate entities (Sierra, GSK, and the US partner) despite full access to the data, which suggests that the asset carries hidden commercial or toxicity risks that outweigh its theoretical value. When combined with a drug class (BET inhibitors) that has historically failed in the clinic and a looming 2033 patent cliff that severely limits future profits, the objective conclusion is that the asset was returned simply because the financial case for developing it no longer stacks up for a major partner.",

Here are some suspicious timeline re 737 and patent filings Investors often ask: \"Why did the US partner return SRA737 in Dec 2024?\" The answer might be in the IP filings. \u200bHere is the timeline that suggests a strategic alignment for a major deal. \u200bThe Setup (Feb 2023): Shortly after SRA737 becomes available, a patent is filed in Europe protecting the combination of Jacobio's JAB-8263 (BET) + Chk1 Inhibitors. Someone was already ring-fencing the strategy.Someone \u200bThe Trigger (Dec 25, 2024): This patent (EP4480494) is finally published. The specific claim to use Jacobio\u2019s drug with a Chk1 inhibitor becomes public knowledge. \u200bThe Reaction (Dec 26, 2024): 24 hours later, Sareum\u2019s US partner terminates their deal. Likely realising the commercial path was now blocked or reserved for a specific player. \u200bThe Payoff (Jan 2026): AstraZeneca announces a strategic partnership with Jacobio. \u200bConclusion: Sareum has reacquired SRA737 with improved economics (63.5%) exactly when the intended partner (Jacobio) has secured the funding (AZ) to execute the plan filed in the patent.",

Based on the patent document EP4480494A1 (published in late December 2024), here is the summary of the \"Who, Why, What, and When.\" \u200bThe Patent: EP4480494A1 When: \u200bPublished: December 25, 2024 (Christmas Day). \u200bStatus: Active Application (European Patent Office). \u200bFiling Date: Likely mid-2023 (based on standard 18-month publication lag), meaning this strategy was formulated before the recent AstraZeneca/Jacobio news. \u200bWhat (The Content): \u200bThe Claim: It outlines a \"Combination Therapy\" for treating advanced tumours (specifically mentioning breast cancer and solid tumours). \u200bThe Recipe: It explicitly claims the use of a BET Inhibitor combined with a Wee1 or Chk1 Inhibitor. \u200bThe \"Jacobio\" Connection: Crucially, the patent text does not just say \"any BET inhibitor.\" It explicitly lists JAB-8263 (Jacobio\u2019s drug) alongside SYHA-1801 (CSPC\u2019s drug) as specific, preferred versions of the BET inhibitor to be used in this combination. \u200bWhy (The Strategy): \u200bThe Problem: BET inhibitors (like JAB-8263) are effective but often trigger resistance mechanisms where the cancer cell repairs itself. \u200bThe Solution: Adding a Chk1 inhibitor stops that repair. \u200bThe Objective: This patent is a \"Land Grab.\" The filer is trying to legally own the method of combining these two specific drug classes before the clinical trials officially start. By naming JAB-8263, they are specifically ring-fencing the use of Jacobio\u2019s asset in this context. Who (The Applicant): \u200bWhile the specific applicant name is often obscured in initial snippet views (or held by a holding entity), the inclusion of SYHA-1801 (owned by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group) alongside JAB-8263 suggests this filing likely originated from the Chinese Pharma ecosystem (possibly CSPC itself or a major research institute). \u200bSignificance: Recall that CSPC is the other major partner AstraZeneca just signed a deal with. This suggests that the players in AstraZeneca\u2019s new \"China Circle\" (CSPC and Jacobio) are already actively patenting these combinations. \u200bSummary for Investors\u000b\u000b \u200bThis patent is proof of intent. It shows that as recently as December 2024, the pharmaceutical industry was actively filing legal paperwork to protect the exact combination (BET + Chk1) that Sareum\u2019s SRA737 facilitates. The fact that they specifically wrote \"JAB-8263\" into the document confirms that Jacobio's drug is viewed as a prime candidate for this mechanism.",

The Hidden Synergy: Sareum SAR x Jacobio Pharma \u200bWhy watch this pair? It\u2019s a classic \"Lock and Key\" scientific fit. \u200b Jacobio has the Engine: JAB-8263 (BET inhibitor), a powerful cancer drug that targets \"Myc-driven\" tumours but often struggles with drug resistance when used alone. Sareum has the Key: SRA737 (Chk1 inhibitor), scientifically proven to prevent that resistance and reduce toxicity (validated by historic AstraZeneca data). \u200bWith Jacobio recently securing a major deal with AstraZeneca and hunting for global assets, Sareum\u2019s SRA737 is the \"missing puzzle piece\" that creates a complete, lower-toxicity cancer therapy. A perfect strategic handshake waiting to happen.",

As a biotech minnow, they just don't have the resources needed for a full scale marketing strategy. Also, Sareums pipeline isn't developed enough for Parker to start kicking in doors and demanding a seat at the table.  The strategic shift from phase 1b to an extended Tox study put the company on path, they now must complete before a deal is made. That would have been fine but it didn't pan out on the first attempt.  Complacency, incompetence or just bad luck.  It doesn't matter now.  We will lose a year and that is that. The other big problem I see here is the disparity between what the board tell us and what we believe will happen.   It kind of started with Thoth, and we loved him for it.  Knowledgeable posts giving believable timescales with some not quite believable outcomes. Pre COVID, I too thought we might get a 2 billion buyout at phase 1.  In reality it was never going to happen. It might never happen and there is a good chance that the all time highs of 2021 were about as good as it gets for Sareum shareholders. Like I said.  The ex Tox study is now a strategy that must be completed before a deal is done. And because of that, Parker hasn't really got anything to sell.  He can have the conversations, maybe generate some interest but he will need a clean Tox study before any negotiations start.   So we wait. JR said 6 months minimum and I suspect SAR being SAR, they will need more than that. I'm not happy about the delays, some of them were probably avoidable and by my own count.  I reckon we are around 3 years behind where we should be if everything went to plan post 2018.   But for now, I'm happy with what the board is doing. Hopefully, the Tox study is successful and we will see some shareholder value creep back in.",

Going back to one of potnaks comments. I think I have said consistently that I have 80,0000 shares , I am about 50% down so lets say 40p break even. I have been in this share probably about 15 years  ,so 50p is not a return for me. The reason I stay in is I dont want to sell at a loss and the journey is not apparently to an end. Like most on this board we have traded a bit and made some money, we have accumulated when we can although to be fair I dropped my holding to buy in a gold mining company with intention of making profit and putting more into sareum. Im covered for pension pretty much , so sareum will determine if my retirement is no frills, good, or very good",

You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit.

That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share.

What do you want them to make a deal with.  The board made (were advised) to run an extended Toxicology study instead of a p1b trial. This in theory, if successful, would add value as the compound is effectively phase 2 ready. 1802 and possibly the new cns compounds are waiting on the results of the Tox study. For 737. I'm convinced that it the patent life, 7 years and counting.  It could take half of that to get into phase 3. So, with the above.  What is there to sell? As always, we need to wait but at today price. You could purchase a potential multi bagger for peanuts. We'll know by the end of this year.",

Presumably, they are similar enough that 1801 validates 1802 safety profile so the planned on licence should be fairly easy.  So we could see 2 deals close together or one bigger deal for both? Im expecting anything major for 737.  Maybe a commitment from a third party to pay for a combo trial and maybe an extended patent for combo use. CNS.  Still very early days but a successful Tox study and safety profile for 1801 will, hopefully give us a nice little package to push into a licence deal. IMO - it wouldn't matter who was running the company.  Without unlimited funds,  we need to wait for the Tox study to complete and based on experience, there is a good chance were not even close to starting it yet. The P1 trial data is just fluff.  It might generate some action here but the market will want tangible news. So where would a HNWI change things?",

          "content": "From AI: The Form 8.3 was filed by Serum Life Sciences Limited. \u2022 Who they are: They are a major investment arm of the Serum Institute of India and hold a ~14.2% stake in Sareum. \u2022 What they filed: Today\u2019s form was actually a disclosure of their 3.12% interest in Oxford Biomedica plc, which is currently in a takeover \"offer period.\" Because the names Serum and Sareum are so similar, and because Serum Life Sciences is the \"cornerstone\" investor for Sareum, this filing automatically triggered alerts for almost every Sareum shareholder. 2. Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",

In this case there could be a few buy orders in waiting for a low price so the order is offered, waiting on bailiff to sell.  When the stock is liquid, an analyst can see the order book and can manipulate the orders to 'maje a market'. There is no way of knowing how many orders are sat waiting to be filled.

If a UK investor we see a TR-1 over 3% and if an overseas investment investor the TR-1 would trigger at 5%. As Potnak points out, that\u2019s a lot of shares. My point was that if another pharmaceutical company wanted to take a stake it could do so quite cheaply- throwing another hand grenade into the mix by asking you all to consider when accumulating, any pharma may well have other Ltd companies they could also use to accumulate a separate percentage using the same methodology. Once all in the open, news is released and said pharma sells down to part fund any deal or is content to stake build. Just some additional speculation whilst we wait for DP64\u2019s HNWI to sort us out!",

Happy to be schooled on this but there are rules designed to stop this scenario.  Anyone can accumulate over days of even weeks but we would see the historical volume. We saw this a lot when RF were offloading their shares.  3 or 400k everyday until All were sold.   All with with matching volume of buys. I suppose someone could try selling 400k shares.

That started on the day of the IM call.  Then is was Christmas.  We're only 6 weeks into this quarter and we did get a \"chairman's corner\" update.  These might not seem much and are not a regulatory requirement but they are a way to show, that everything is on track. You asked when I would get concerned. Depends, but if we got another chairman's corner this month. Then I guess mid march might become a bit tense.  In terms of 737 and the bio industry.  AACR is in April  and ASCO is May\\June.   It would be a shame if 737 doesn't get a mention at both these events but that would depend on the path the board are taking with this compound.",

If a UK investor we see a TR-1 over 3% and if an overseas investment investor the TR-1 would trigger at 5%. As Potnak points out, that\u2019s a lot of shares. My point was that if another pharmaceutical company wanted to take a stake it could do so quite cheaply- throwing another hand grenade into the mix by asking you all to consider when accumulating, any pharma may well have other Ltd companies they could also use to accumulate a separate percentage using the same methodology. Once all in the open, news is released and said pharma sells down to part fund any deal or is content to stake build. Just some additional speculation whilst we wait for DP64\u2019s HNWI to sort us out!",

Happy to be schooled on this but there are rules designed to stop this scenario.  Anyone can accumulate over days of even weeks but we would see the historical volume. We saw this a lot when RF were offloading their shares.  3 or 400k everyday until All were sold.   All with with matching volume of buys. I suppose someone could try selling 400k shares.

These might not seem much and are not a regulatory requirement but they are a way to show, that everything is on track. You asked when I would get concerned. Depends, but if we got another chairman's corner this month. Then I guess mid march might become a bit tense.  In terms of 737 and the bio industry.  AACR is in April  and ASCO is May\\June.

The only way you could do this legally and stay under the radar is to instruct your broker to keep buying small amounts in separate small orders.  A TR1 must be notified within 2 days in both cases.  You'd need, well over 3 million shares for a TR1.  Even if you could buy 300k shares everyday, you'd need 10 solid days to get there. The rules are complicated and I've never really understood them but MM's can hold shares overnight but the risk is high. They could gap down and they'd be holding shares that are worth less than they purchased them for. Long post to basically say.  It's just the MM's trying to make a market.",

We identified that high CHEK1 expression in AD is significantly correlated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, high CHEK1 levels were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with AD, highlighting its potential utility in stratifying high-risk patients. These findings suggest that CHEK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for adenocarcinoma, particularly in younger patients or those with aggressive disease features. Clinically, CHEK1 expression may serve as a useful biomarker to identify high-risk AD patients who could benefit from intensified surveillance or emerging CHEK1-targeted therapies.

A successful clinical trial was conducted in 2023 and 2024. 2025 was all about clicking send on the final report - it's hardly a great achievement for the year. 2025 was the year of the failed tox study. They took back 737 and have done bu***** all with it. Let's face - 2025 was not a year to be proud of. RNS, 1st July 2024: Positive Data from SDC-1801 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Cambridge, UK, 1 July 2024 - Sareum Holdings plc (AIM: SAR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation kinase inhibitors for autoimmune disease and cancer, is pleased to announce positive topline data from its Phase 1a clinical trial of SDC-1801, a dual TYK2/JAK1 kinase inhibitor being developed as a potential new therapeutic for a range of autoimmune diseases. Following the dosing of the final cohort in the Multiple Ascending Dose stage of the trial, and review of the initial data by the Safety Review Committee, the Company reports that: \u00b7 Blood plasma levels of SDC-1801 significantly in excess of the predicted therapeutic exposure were achieved, with a half-life of between 17 and 20 hours observed, which suggests that once-daily dosing will be possible* \u00b7 No deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported \u00b7 Although data remains blinded, there appear to be no significant changes in blood cell counts or increases in serum creatinine levels, which may be dose limiting side-effects of brepocitinib, currently the most advanced TYK2/JAK1 dual inhibitor *Half-life is an estimation of the time it takes for an initial concentration of SDC-1801 to be reduced by half in the body. The Company expects that further data, unblinded from drug/placebo recipients, including details of any mild or moderate adverse events and biomarkers of TYK2 and/or JAK1 inhibition, will be available in Q3 2024.",

Yes there is frustration, but, do some really believe the BoD screwed up the Toxicity Studies deliberately, just to grab some more salary ( and note as yet no bonuses declared for last year ). As an attendee at the AGM, I heard the BoD\u2019s own frustrations, the proposals to rectify,  advancement on other parts of the business and their \u201cintended\u201dtimelines to achieve - all during the progressive course of this year 2026 - when I look at the calendar, we are currently in week 6 of 52, not even halfway through Q1! To date, the Chairman has posted a report (communication) reiterating the information provided in the Annual Statement- those who care to read it will understand where we are as a Company, google AI and it will tell you the same, no slandering of the BoD - just the risk of a bio tech investment. For me, a pathway has been laid out after a very frustrating period, I await the progress as and when achieved (as it can't be made up to pamper the noise) and hopefully it leads to increased sp revaluation that was the intention when I invested. Still 7 weeks of Q1 left for an update on any one of our \u201ccurrent\u201d 4 compounds - my bet is still on the table! Have a good day! GLA",

However, there will be no assumptions made when/if a deal is negotiated.  The boards commercial ability hasn't been tested yet, or at least, we haven't seen the results yet.  I will ask again, what do you think a replacement board would do differently? With 1801, we have the equivalent of a house that has just had a really bad survey come back or a car that has just failed it's mot.  We've just found out the the testing centre was at fault which is encouraging but the buyer is obviously nervous and wants the test to be run again before negotiating the cost to buy. I dont know if 1801 is good but I can think critically and I know the boards hands are tied until they have good data from the tox study.  I suspect they will need to wait until it completes fully.  So if it start on the next week or do. End of Q3 or beginning of Q4.  But I said that last October when we got the RNS. You have your opinion, that's great but maybe work through some other scenarios in your head too.   I have been critical of the board before but in this case.  They don't yet have any thing they can do a deal with. No one would.",

A fun exercise netherless.  Anyway, here it is. From a skeptical perspective, the \"Christmas Conspiracy\" is most likely a coincidence of standard year-end fiscal housekeeping rather than a strategic masterplan, and the mention of Jacobio in the patent is typical defensive legal drafting (\"kitchen-sinking\") rather than evidence of a handshake. Fundamentally, SRA737 has now been deprioritised by three separate entities (Sierra, GSK, and the US partner) despite full access to the data, which suggests that the asset carries hidden commercial or toxicity risks that outweigh its theoretical value. When combined with a drug class (BET inhibitors) that has historically failed in the clinic and a looming 2033 patent cliff that severely limits future profits, the objective conclusion is that the asset was returned simply because the financial case for developing it no longer stacks up for a major partner.",

Here are some suspicious timeline re 737 and patent filings Investors often ask: \"Why did the US partner return SRA737 in Dec 2024?\" The answer might be in the IP filings. \u200bHere is the timeline that suggests a strategic alignment for a major deal. \u200bThe Setup (Feb 2023): Shortly after SRA737 becomes available, a patent is filed in Europe protecting the combination of Jacobio's JAB-8263 (BET) + Chk1 Inhibitors. Someone was already ring-fencing the strategy.Someone \u200bThe Trigger (Dec 25, 2024): This patent (EP4480494) is finally published. The specific claim to use Jacobio\u2019s drug with a Chk1 inhibitor becomes public knowledge. \u200bThe Reaction (Dec 26, 2024): 24 hours later, Sareum\u2019s US partner terminates their deal. Likely realising the commercial path was now blocked or reserved for a specific player. \u200bThe Payoff (Jan 2026): AstraZeneca announces a strategic partnership with Jacobio. \u200bConclusion: Sareum has reacquired SRA737 with improved economics (63.5%) exactly when the intended partner (Jacobio) has secured the funding (AZ) to execute the plan filed in the patent.",

          "content": "Gone down the rabbit hole with this.  Got a little AI agent traveling the net and reporting back.  May not be sra737 but they getting trying to patent the chk\\bet combo. Based on the patent document EP4480494A1 (published in late December 2024), here is the summary of the \"Who, Why, What, and When.\" \u200bThe Patent: EP4480494A1 When: \u200bPublished: December 25, 2024 (Christmas Day). \u200bStatus: Active Application (European Patent Office). \u200bFiling Date: Likely mid-2023 (based on standard 18-month publication lag), meaning this strategy was formulated before the recent AstraZeneca/Jacobio news. \u200bWhat (The Content): \u200bThe Claim: It outlines a \"Combination Therapy\" for treating advanced tumours (specifically mentioning breast cancer and solid tumours). \u200bThe Recipe: It explicitly claims the use of a BET Inhibitor combined with a Wee1 or Chk1 Inhibitor. \u200bThe \"Jacobio\" Connection: Crucially, the patent text does not just say \"any BET inhibitor.\" It explicitly lists JAB-8263 (Jacobio\u2019s drug) alongside SYHA-1801 (CSPC\u2019s drug) as specific, preferred versions of the BET inhibitor to be used in this combination. \u200bWhy (The Strategy): \u200bThe Problem: BET inhibitors (like JAB-8263) are effective but often trigger resistance mechanisms where the cancer cell repairs itself. \u200bThe Solution: Adding a Chk1 inhibitor stops that repair. \u200bThe Objective: This patent is a \"Land Grab.\" The filer is trying to legally own the method of combining these two specific drug classes before the clinical trials officially start. By naming JAB-8263, they are specifically ring-fencing the use of Jacobio\u2019s asset in this context. Who (The Applicant): \u200bWhile the specific applicant name is often obscured in initial snippet views (or held by a holding entity), the inclusion of SYHA-1801 (owned by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group) alongside JAB-8263 suggests this filing likely originated from the Chinese Pharma ecosystem (possibly CSPC itself or a major research institute). \u200bSignificance: Recall that CSPC is the other major partner AstraZeneca just signed a deal with. This suggests that the players in AstraZeneca\u2019s new \"China Circle\" (CSPC and Jacobio) are already actively patenting these combinations. \u200bSummary for Investors\u000b\u000b \u200bThis patent is proof of intent. It shows that as recently as December 2024, the pharmaceutical industry was actively filing legal paperwork to protect the exact combination (BET + Chk1) that Sareum\u2019s SRA737 facilitates. The fact that they specifically wrote \"JAB-8263\" into the document confirms that Jacobio's drug is viewed as a prime candidate for this mechanism.",

Sareum has the Key: SRA737 (Chk1 inhibitor), scientifically proven to prevent that resistance and reduce toxicity (validated by historic AstraZeneca data). \u200bWith Jacobio recently securing a major deal with AstraZeneca and hunting for global assets, Sareum\u2019s SRA737 is the \"missing puzzle piece\" that creates a complete, lower-toxicity cancer therapy.

          "content": "You make some valid points, Utar and I have been critical of the board over the years too. However, I wouldn't say the board lack the commercial  experience. IMO. As a biotech minnow, they just don't have the resources needed for a full scale marketing strategy. Also, Sareums pipeline isn't developed enough for Parker to start kicking in doors and demanding a seat at the table.  The strategic shift from phase 1b to an extended Tox study put the company on path, they now must complete before a deal is made. That would have been fine but it didn't pan out on the first attempt.  Complacency, incompetence or just bad luck.  It doesn't matter now.  We will lose a year and that is that. The other big problem I see here is the disparity between what the board tell us and what we believe will happen.   It kind of started with Thoth, and we loved him for it.  Knowledgeable posts giving believable timescales with some not quite believable outcomes. Pre COVID, I too thought we might get a 2 billion buyout at phase 1.  In reality it was never going to happen. It might never happen and there is a good chance that the all time highs of 2021 were about as good as it gets for Sareum shareholders. Like I said.  The ex Tox study is now a strategy that must be completed before a deal is done. And because of that, Parker hasn't really got anything to sell.  He can have the conversations, maybe generate some interest but he will need a clean Tox study before any negotiations start.   So we wait. JR said 6 months minimum and I suspect SAR being SAR, they will need more than that. I'm not happy about the delays, some of them were probably avoidable and by my own count.  I reckon we are around 3 years behind where we should be if everything went to plan post 2018.   But for now, I'm happy with what the board is doing. Hopefully, the Tox study is successful and we will see some shareholder value creep back in.",

Very little mission as well. What value are they trying to achieve for instance before they sell? Its lack of real strategy and commercialism  which is frustrating.  Going back to one of potnaks comments. I think I have said consistently that I have 80,0000 shares , I am about 50% down so lets say 40p break even. I have been in this share probably about 15 years  ,so 50p is not a return for me. The reason I stay in is I dont want to sell at a loss and the journey is not apparently to an end. Like most on this board we have traded a bit and made some money, we have accumulated when we can although to be fair I dropped my holding to buy in a gold mining company with intention of making profit and putting more into sareum. Im covered for pension pretty much , so sareum will determine if my retirement is no frills, good, or very good",

          "content": "Utar. I'm not sure why you are here, if you think that.  Can I ask. When you stopped posting here, did you sell up and recently buy back in? You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share. That could be within a year.",

When we got that RNS 111 days ago. I said at the time that it has put us back a full year but the board then obfuscate by using words like soon, early in new year, early in Q1.  The reality is the data from the Tox study will probably readout late summer into Q4.  1 year after the halting of the study.",

          "content": "Utar. I'm not sure why you are here, if you think that.  Can I ask. When you stopped posting here, did you sell up and recently buy back in? You seem to not know what has happened here. One the day we got the RNS notifying the equity raise of \u00a35 million. The share price was around a pound but that was with approx 60 million shares in issue. We then went on a downward spiral and by Apr we almost hit 10p.  SAR then raise via a WRAP at 10p.  With this raise and warrants there are now approx 150 million shares in issue. Last sept\\oct, with sentiment growing, the share price was rising to around 27p then we got the RNS stating the Tox study had been halted. We now know that it was halted in week 4 of a 16 week study. The share price dropped to 10p but then it appeared the issue wasn't the compound but the delivery method, some confidence restored. However, most here will know what reading that RNS felt like. After more than 10 years, for a brief period, it felt like it was over.  That sentiment still lingers, with  LTH and with those watching and waiting to buy in.  I took a different view, putting a lot of trust in what the board are saying and I purchased. I have purchased every time the SP got near 10p post Riverfort.  I had 50k shares pre RF, I now have 400k.  Today, I'm \u00a310k in profit. There are others here with close to 6 figure profits. 50p on Tox study success would be less than the market cap on the day we were notified the RF were onboard (fleecing us).   That day, we hadn't completed p1a or even thought about an extended Tox study.  With standard valuation techniques, a phase 2 ready with good toxicology data should be worth between 50 and 300 million. Psoriasis is a crowded market and Sareum aren't front runners so let's call it \u00a350 to \u00a3100 million.  Add 1802 into that. And we might not be far off a pound a share. That could be within a year.",

What do you want them to make a deal with.  The board made (were advised) to run an extended Toxicology study instead of a p1b trial. This in theory, if successful, would add value as the compound is effectively phase 2 ready. 1802 and possibly the new cns compounds are waiting on the results of the Tox study. For 737. I'm convinced that it the patent life, 7 years and counting.  It could take half of that to get into phase 3. So, with the above.  What is there to sell?

          "content": "Hey Bobbler, where exactly do you think a change in leadership will make a difference? They need to complete the Tox study before any deals on 1801 and 1802.  Presumably, they are similar enough that 1801 validates 1802 safety profile so the planned on licence should be fairly easy.  So we could see 2 deals close together or one bigger deal for both? Im expecting anything major for 737.  Maybe a commitment from a third party to pay for a combo trial and maybe an extended patent for combo use. CNS.  Still very early days but a successful Tox study and safety profile for 1801 will, hopefully give us a nice little package to push into a licence deal. IMO - it wouldn't matter who was running the company.  Without unlimited funds,  we need to wait for the Tox study to complete and based on experience, there is a good chance were not even close to starting it yet. The P1 trial data is just fluff.  It might generate some action here but the market will want tangible news. So where would a HNWI change things?",

          "content": "From AI: The Form 8.3 was filed by Serum Life Sciences Limited. \u2022 Who they are: They are a major investment arm of the Serum Institute of India and hold a ~14.2% stake in Sareum. \u2022 What they filed: Today\u2019s form was actually a disclosure of their 3.12% interest in Oxford Biomedica plc, which is currently in a takeover \"offer period.\" Because the names Serum and Sareum are so similar, and because Serum Life Sciences is the \"cornerstone\" investor for Sareum, this filing automatically triggered alerts for almost every Sareum shareholder. 2. Why it matters to Sareum investors anyway Even though the form isn't about a bid for Sareum, investors are reading into it for two strategic reasons: \u2022 The \"Big Money\" is Active: It shows that Sareum's largest backer is actively trading and increasing its influence in the UK biotech sector. \u2022 Speculation of a \"Read-Across\": The market for UK biotech is heating up. Just yesterday (January 22), Sareum's Chairman released a letter stating that 2026 would be a \"pivotal year\" and that they are looking for licensing partners or buyers for their drug assets. Seeing their main backer involved in other takeover-related disclosures (like Oxford Biomedica) reinforces the idea that the sector is ripe for M&A. 3. Current Status of Sareum As of today, Sareum is not in an offer period. If a Form 8.3 were ever filed naming Sareum as the offeree (the company being bought), it would be a massive signal that a formal takeover bid is on the table.",
