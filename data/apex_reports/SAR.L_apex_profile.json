Despite a temporary setback with the discontinuation of a toxicology study, the Company\nhas made significant operational progress, including the appointment of a leading global contract research organisation (CRO), and is now well-positioned to restart these important studies and advance towards Phase 2 development.\nSDC-1801 (autoimmune disease)\nSDC-1801, Sareum's selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor, remains positioned as a potential treatment for a range of autoimmune diseases, with an initial focus on psoriasis, an autoimmune condition affecting the skin.\nAs previously announced, SDC-1801 has completed Phase 1 clinical development. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that SDC-1801 achieved blood plasma levels significantly exceeding the predicted therapeutic exposure, with a half-life of 17-20 hours supporting once-daily dosing with a smooth delivery of drug over the dosing period. Importantly, no deaths or serious adverse events due to SDC-1801 were reported, and the frequency of adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in the active and placebo groups.\nNotably, SDC-1801 has not exhibited any of the potentially dose-limiting side effects that have been observed with leading dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors in clinical development, reinforcing the molecule's differentiated profile and best-in-class potential.\nFollowing successful completion of the clinical trial, two large-scale batches of SDC-1801 have been manufactured: one under GMP conditions for future planned clinical studies, and a non-GMP batch for the Phase 2 enabling toxicology studies.\nProcess chemistry improvements have enhanced the purity profile of SDC-1801 while maintaining good manufacturing yield.\nA programme of work to optimise the capsule formulation of SDC-1801 is underway, aimed at enhancing drug release at higher doses and reducing the number of capsules required per dose in future clinical trials.\nConsiderable progress has been made, and the Company expects this project to conclude in Q1 2026.\nAs announced on 10 October 2025, the Company discontinued its 16-week GLP preclinical toxicology study for SDC-1801 following unexpected safety findings, observed by the third-party provider of the study. These findings occurred at a higher incidence in control-group animals that received an inactive dosing solution compared to those dosed with SDC-1801.\nThe Company has now appointed a different leading global CRO, with extensive experience in long-term toxicology studies, to restart the Phase 2-enabling toxicology programme. Prior to commencing the full 16-week toxicology study, the Company will conduct a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate four different formulations, three liquid formulations for gavage dosing and one capsule formulation. This five-day study will provide valuable data on both tolerability and exposure levels, helping to optimise the formulation selection for the full toxicology study.\nThe carrier formulation is specific to the animal toxicology studies only and will not form part of any human dosing regimen.\nThe PK study is expected to commence imminently, with the full toxicology study expected to restart as early as possible in Q1 2026. Both studies will be completed using the Company's existing cash resources and the existing toxicology batch of SDC-1801.\nSDC-1802 (cancer immunotherapy)\nTranslational studies with SDC-1802 have been completed, providing a solid data package to support potential further development. The strongest cancer response was seen in haematological cancers, with significant unmet medical need, including T-ALL and B-cell lymphoma.\nThe Company is reviewing how best to progress SDC-1802 into clinical development and notes that partnering may be the preferred route at this stage.\nSRA737 (cancer)\nSRA737 is a clinical-stage oral, selective inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) that targets cancer cell replication and DNA damage repair mechanisms.\nIn March 2025, the former US licence arrangement for SRA737 was terminated and the asset reverted to the CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF). Sareum successfully acquired the licence for SRA737 following this termination, renegotiating significantly improved economic terms. The Company now receives 63.5% of all future revenues compared to 27.5% under the former agreement, at no cost to the Company.\nThe Company continues to explore partnering opportunities for SRA737, building on positive Phase 1/2 data that demonstrated good tolerability as monotherapy and promising activity in combination with low-dose gemcitabine in anogenital cancers, an area of significant unmet medical need.\nFurthermore,\nSareum has maintained an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), opened by the previous licence holder, to conduct a Phase 1 trial in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The Company retains sufficient stock of SRA737 capsules to conduct such a trial.\nThe Company remains confident in the potential of SRA737 and is assessing the most effective routes to progress and create value from this asset.\nTYK2 Neuroscience Programme (CNS)\nSareum has initiated a collaboration with Receptor.AI to accelerate discovery of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant, isoform-selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors for potential use in neuro-inflammatory indications such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.\nThis programme builds on earlier preclinical work from the Company's SKIL platform, which demonstrated blood-brain barrier permeability of selected TYK2/JAK1 molecules. The collaboration extends the relevance of Sareum's TYK2/JAK1 expertise into central nervous system diseases, areas of increasing scientific and commercial interest.\nA first batch of compounds have been designed and synthesized and are currently undergoing testing in biochemical assays to assess their potency against the JAK kinases, and in early-stage\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (\nADME) assays to assess their potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and give sufficient exposure at the target site.\nFuture Direction\nAs part of a broader value-realisation strategy, Sareum has engaged a specialist US-based business development consultancy to actively broaden and accelerate ongoing partnering discussions for SDC-1801 and SRA737.\nThe Board continues to prioritise non-dilutive funding routes to advance the pipeline and protect shareholder value, with current core activities funded from existing cash resources.\nSareum continues to review the optimum level of staffing for the Company, including Chief Medical Officer and Chief Executive Officer roles.\nSummary\nSareum has made substantial progress across its pipeline during 2025. The positive Phase 1 data for SDC-1801, together with the competitive profile versus other TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors in development, continues to support SDC-1801's potential as a best-in-class, once-daily oral therapy for autoimmune diseases. Despite the frustrating delay to the toxicology study, the Company's confidence in the molecule remains strong, and the study is now on track to restart in Q1 2026.\nThe significantly improved economic terms for SRA737, coupled with active partnering discussions for this asset and SDC-1802, position the Company to create value across its portfolio. The new TYK2 neuroscience collaboration adds further long-term potential. The Company has engaged specialist business development consultants to support partnering efforts across key programmes.\nWith strengthened intellectual property, a clear operational roadmap, active business development initiatives, and sufficient financial resources, the Company enters the new period with confidence and a clear set of value-creating milestones ahead.\nWe would like to thank our shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.\nAGM Webcast\nA live webcast to the investment community will be made available online via the Investor Meet Company platform. Existing and potential investors wishing to participate in the presentation can register on\nwww.investormeetcompany.com/sareum-holdings-plc/register-investor\n.
