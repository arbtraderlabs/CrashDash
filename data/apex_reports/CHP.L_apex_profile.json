          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 8643P\nCaledonian Holdings PLC\n22 January 2026\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK version of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 January 2026\nCaledonian Holdings plc\n(\"Caledonian\" or the \"Company\")\nFurther investment in AlbaCo Limited\nCaledonian Holdings plc is pleased to announce that it has entered into a further subscription agreement to provide short-term funding support to existing investee company, AlbaCo Limited (\"AlbaCo\" or \"Alba\"), to support the business through the ongoing banking licence assessment process.\nUnder the subscription agreement, Caledonian has committed \u00a3750,000 of funding to AlbaCo. This funding is in addition to the aggregate \u00a31.45 million investment in Alba announced by the Company on 7 October 2025 and 18 December 2025 and reflects Caledonian's continued conviction in Alba as a core portfolio investment.\nThe funds will be drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources.\nFunding terms\nThe funding will be provided on terms substantially consistent with Caledonian's previous short-term support arrangements announced on 7 October 2025 and 18 December 2025, including a 25% fee payable either in cash or in new ordinary shares in AlbaCo upon completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising. Warrants will also be issued to Caledonian conditional on,\ninter alia\n, completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising.\nCaledonian currently holds 1,500,000 shares in AlbaCo, representing 5.47% of AlbaCo's existing issued share capital.\nStrategic rationale\nCaledonian views AlbaCo as a core long-term investment. This additional funding:\n\u00b7\nsupports AlbaCo's operational continuity during the banking licence assessment process;\n\u00b7\nenables AlbaCo to maintain momentum across regulatory, operational and commercial workstreams; and\n\u00b7\nreinforces Caledonian's commitment as AlbaCo progresses towards potential authorisation and launch.\nThere can be no certainty that a banking licence will be granted, which remains subject to regulatory approval.\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are pleased to continue supporting AlbaCo at this important stage of its journey. Our funding terms are structured to ensure Caledonian's interests are fully protected and that our shareholders benefit from any future improvement in AlbaCo's capital-raising terms. We remain confident in AlbaCo's progress and believe this approach positions Caledonian to capture meaningful long-term value as the regulatory process advances.\"\nInformation on Alba\nAlba aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. Alba aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. Alba is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, Alba reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, Alba's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The fundraises and the recent facility put in place from Yorkville have\nstrengthened the Company's cash reserves to support the new strategy and has provided a strong foundation to carry out the first two investments as a financial services focused investing company.\nAs previously reported CHP made its first investment into AlbaCo\nLimited (\"AlbaCo\") in June 2025 and invested an aggregate of cash and shares totalling \u00a31,000,000 into AlbaCo. In October 2025 CHP announced that it had provided further support to AlbaCo with a subscription agreement totalling \u00a31,000,000 to support its near-term working capital requirements and the development of AlbaCo in securing its authorisation capital raise. This funding followed on from a \u00a3120,000 prepayment provided to AlbaCo in September 2025. The \u00a31m facility was drawn down in full by AlbaCo in October 2025 and November 2025. Furthermore, on 18 December 2025 we entered into a further subscription agreement to commit a further \u00a3450,000 as a prepayment towards\nour participation in Alba's forthcoming regulatory capital fundraising. The funds were drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources bringing the total funds advanced to AlbaCo since September 2025 to \u00a31.57 million.\nThe Board has continued to monitor the share prices of its listed/quoted investment portfolio and, where appropriate, has divested in whole or in part a number of investee companies, realising value where possible, and reducing legacy holdings to enable the Company to concentrate on building its new portfolio in financial services.\nTurning to the financials, the Company reported a loss for the year of \u00a3595,572 compared to a loss of \u00a32,736,882 in the comparable period. Almost all of this difference, from an accounting perspective, reflects a reduction in fair value of investments in the comparable period being reported on. Net assets increased to \u00a33,851,777 compared to \u00a32,873,720 at 30 September 2024 and cash increased from \u00a3787,336 at the beginning of the period to \u00a31,019,217 at the balance sheet date.\nSince the period end CHP has been successful in securing a \u00a33.5 million funding package from Yorkville, to help with further short term funding for AlbaCo, other investment opportunities and general working capital. Full details are set out in the Company's announcement of 14 November 2025.\nLast month we announced our second investment under the new strategy. We have entered a conditional agreement to acquire 100% of Aspire Commerce Group Limited which represents a significant step in delivering our strategy to build an integrated, technology-enabled financial services investment group. While our current\ninvesting policy does not allow for Caledonian to make investments which will cause the Company to hold a majority equity interest in an investee company, we are looking for shareholder support at the Company's upcoming annual general meeting to enable us to implement a new investing policy. Alongside the announcement of the conditional acquisition, Caledonian put in place a working capital funding facility of up to \u00a3600,000 with Aspire of which \u00a3300,000 has been advanced on the terms set out in the Company's announcement of 26 November 2025.\nThe Board will continue to update shareholders, in line with regulatory requirements, through announcements and other appropriate communications.\nThe directors would like to thank shareholders for their continued support and look forward to continuing to deliver this new strategy.\nBrent Fitzpatrick\nChairman\n23

2025\n1. General information\nCaledonian Holdings plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.\nThese unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" as adopted by the European Union and do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. This condensed set of financial statements has been prepared applying the accounting policies that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 and are presented in pounds sterling.\nThe comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 March 2025 have been extracted from the Company's statutory accounts which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and reported on by the Company's Auditors. Their report was unqualified and contained no statement under section 298 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\n2. Changes in accounting policy\nThe assessment of new standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective are not anticipated to have a material impact on the interim financial statements.\n3. Going concern\nThe Directors have considered the Company's activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, the financial position of the Company, and its cash flows and liquidity position, taking account of the current market conditions. This review has demonstrated that the Company shall continue to operate within its own resources.\nThe Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these condensed financial statements.\n4. (Loss) per share\n(Loss) per share has been calculated on a loss of \u00a3595,000 (six months to 30 September 2024: \u00a32,736,000 loss; year to 31 March 2025: \u00a34,371,000 loss) and the weighted number of average shares in issue for the period of 71,799,245,979 (30 September 2024: 17,556,553,841; 31 March 2025: 18,697,592,139).\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2025\n6 months ended\n30 September 2024\nYear\nended\n31 March\n2025\n(Loss) / profit (\u00a3'000)\n(595)\n(2,736)\n(4,371)\n(Loss) per share (pence)\n(0.0008)\n(0.0155)\n(0.0233)\n5.

This funding is in addition to the \u00a31.0 million investment in Alba announced by the Company on 7 October 2025 and reflects Caledonian's continued conviction in Alba as a core portfolio investment.\nFunding structure\nThe Company has today entered into a subscription agreement to commit \u00a3450,000 of funding to Alba as a prepayment towards Caledonian's participation in Alba's forthcoming regulatory capital fundraising. The funds will be drawn down by Alba immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources.\nThe facility will be provided on substantially the same terms as Caledonian's previous short-term support to Alba announced on 7 October 2025, with an accompanying 25% fee payable to Caledonian in cash or new ordinary shares in Alba upon completion of Alba's regulatory capital fundraising reflective of the nature and duration of the facility. Warrants will also be granted to Caledonian conditional on,\ninter alia\n, completion of Alba's regulatory capital fundraising.\nCaledonian currently holds 1,500,000 shares in Alba which is equivalent to 5.47% of Alba's existing issued share capital.\nStrategic Rationale\nCaledonian views Alba as a core long-term investment and continues to support the development of a modern, digitally-enabled UK challenger bank. The provision of this short-term funding:\n\u00b7\nsupports Alba's operational continuity during the ongoing banking licence assessment process;\n\u00b7\nenables the Alba business to maintain momentum across regulatory, operational and commercial workstreams; and\n\u00b7\nreinforces Caledonian's commitment to Alba as it progresses towards potential authorisation and launch.\nThere can be no certainty that a banking licence will be granted, which remains subject to regulatory approval.\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director, commented:\n\"This additional support reflects our continued confidence in Alba and the progress made across governance, systems and regulatory engagement. We believe it is appropriate to ensure the business remains well capitalised as it advances through the licensing process.\"\nJim McColl, Executive Director, added:\n\"Alba has made substantial progress this year in strengthening its business model, governance and funding position. This further support from Caledonian reflects our strong belief in the long-term opportunity and the high-quality team leading the Bank.\"\nInformation on Alba\nAlba aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. Alba aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. Alba is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, Alba reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, Alba's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n26 November 2025\nCaledonian Holdings plc\n(\"Caledonian\" or the \"Company\")\nProposed Acquisition of Aspire Commerce Group Limited, Entry into Working Capital Loan Agreement and Execution of Deed of Priority\nCaledonian Holdings plc (AIM: CHP) is pleased to announce that it has, on 25 November 2025, entered into a conditional agreement to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Aspire Commerce Group Limited (\"Aspire\") for a consideration of \u00a31, implying an enterprise value of \u00a3\n9,489,805 as at 25 November 2025 (the \"Proposed Acquisition\").\nTo support Aspire's short-term liquidity needs during the period prior to completion, Caledonian has executed a loan agreement to provide working-capital funding to Aspire of up to \u00a3600,000 (the \"Facility\"). The Facility is being made available from the Company's existing cash resources and follows on from the recently completed funding package with Yorkville Advisors Global, LP which was intended to be utilised for investing in fintech businesses in line with the Company's stated strategy.\nThe Company has also entered into a Deed of Priority with Aspire and its existing lender(s) to govern ranking and enforcement rights during the interim funding period.\nCompletion of the Proposed Acquisition is conditional upon:\n\u00b7\nreceipt of regulatory change-of-control approval from the FCA; and\n\u00b7\napproval by Caledonian shareholders of an amendment to the Company's investing policy to permit majority ownership of portfolio companies.\nStrategic rationale\nThe Proposed Acquisition represents a significant step in delivering Caledonian's strategy to build an integrated, technology-enabled financial-services investment group. Aspire provides a highly complementary platform that enables Caledonian to accelerate its fintech ambitions and deploy capital in areas requiring regulated infrastructure.\nThe Proposed Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nestablishes a core operating and technology platform\ncapable of supporting current accounts, FX, trade finance and business lending, giving Caledonian an immediate footprint in regulated financial-services infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nenables Caledonian to deploy complementary technologies and service lines\nwithout repeated regulatory approval cycles, materially shortening product development and time-to-market;\n\u00b7\ncreates a scalable base for an integrated fintech ecosystem\n, aligning with Caledonian's strategy to build capability across payments, lending, data and financial operations under one group structure;\n\u00b7\npreserves and stabilises value through the Facility\n, ensuring operational continuity during the transition period and protecting the underlying technology and customer pipeline;\n\u00b7\nprovides access to experienced operators and a developed technology stack\n, avoiding the cost, time and execution risk associated with building equivalent infrastructure internally; and\n\u00b7\nsupports a value-accretive restructuring\n, with Aspire's lenders indicating support for a long-dated repayment profile free from interest accrual, improving Aspire's financial resilience post-acquisition.\nThe Board of Caledonian believe that Aspire will serve as a foundational platform for Caledonian's financial-services strategy, enabling the Company to scale more efficiently and expand into adjacent fintech verticals.\nAspire\nAspire is a one stop shop for current accounts, business finance and foreign exchange transactions (FX). The company addresses the \u00a322bn UK trade finance gap through its proprietary technology and multi-asset ledger system, operating under the leadership of experienced financial business builders who have a proven track record within the payments and commercial lending markets.\nThe lending solutions, supported by fully functional current accounts and FX, all provided in-house, allow businesses to handle cash flow problems and pursue expansion opportunities which traditional lenders do not support.\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024, Aspire generated unaudited revenue of \u00a336,057 and reported a loss before tax of approximately \u00a33,993,389. As at 31 December 2024, Aspire's unaudited net liabilities were \u00a34,950,432.\nDebt position and lender support\nAs at 24 November 2025, Aspire's\nnon-current liabilities totalled \u00a39,489,804, largely comprising historic development funding used to build its technology platform.\nCaledonian has held discussions with Aspire's existing lenders, who have indicated support for a comprehensive post-completion restructuring of these liabilities. The restructuring, which will be part of the final agreed terms on the Proposed Acquisition, is expected to deliver:\n\u00b7\nno capital repayments for an initial number of years following completion;\n\u00b7\ncessation of interest accruing from completion; and\n\u00b7\na long-dated, performance-aligned repayment schedule consistent with Aspire's cashflow profile.\nThe Directors believe this restructuring will create a sustainable, growth-oriented capital structure, unlocking the value inherent in Aspire's technology and positioning the Company for long-term success.\nWorking Capital Facility Agreement\nUnder the Facility, Caledonian has agreed to make available a facility of up to \u00a3600,000, structured as follows:\n\u00b7\nTotal commitment:\n\u00a3600,000\n\u00b7\nTranche 1:\n\u00a3300,000 advanced at signing of the Facility agreement\n\u00b7\nTranche 2:\n\u00a3300,000 available within 3 months at Caledonian's discretion and subject to Aspire continuing to operate in the ordinary course of its business\n\u00b7\nPurpose:\nexclusive general working-capital support for Aspire\n\u00b7\nInterest:\n10% per annum, accruing daily and payable on redemption\n\u00b7\nTerm:\nrepayable on the earliest of:\no\ntwo years from signing;\no\ncompletion of the Proposed Acquisition; and\no\nan event of default.\nRepayment may be made at any time without penalty.\nWarrants\nAs consideration for providing the Facility, Aspire has granted Caledonian nil-cost warrants to subscribe for 9.99% of Aspire's issued share capital as at the date of the loan agreement (the \"Warrants\").\n\u00b7\nThe Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to completion of the Proposed Acquisition or repayment of the Facility; and\n\u00b7\nThe Warrants automatically lapse upon completion of the Proposed Acquisition or full repayment of the Facility (whichever occurs first).\nRanking and Protections\nIn accordance with the Facility agreement:\n\u00b7\nthe Facility constitutes senior, prior-ranking unsecured debt, ranking ahead of all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of Aspire;\n\u00b7\nit remains subordinated only to secured or preferential obligations required by law; and\n\u00b7\nAspire may not incur debt ranking ahead of, or\npari passu\nwith, the Facility without Caledonian's consent.\nThese terms are reinforced via the Deed of Priority.\nDeed of Priority\nThe Deed of Priority governs the ranking between:\n\u00b7\nthe Facility provided by Caledonian; and\n\u00b7\nAspire's existing obligations.\nIt ensures:\n\u00b7\nCaledonian's interim funding is appropriately protected;\n\u00b7\nno cross-default or enforcement rights are triggered by drawing the Facility; and\n\u00b7\nan orderly transition to the post-completion capital structure.\nEffect of Completion of the Proposed Acquisition\nUpon completion of the Proposed Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nall accrued but unpaid interest ceases to be payable;\n\u00b7\nthe Caledonian's priority ranking ceases; and\n\u00b7\nthe Warrants automatically lapse.\nThis reflects that the Facility is purely bridging finance for Aspire pending the Proposed Acquisition.\nProposed change to Investing Policy\nThe Company's current investing policy does not allow for Caledonian to make investments which will cause the Company to hold a majority equity interest in an investee company. Pursuant to the Proposed Acquisition the Company is proposing to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Aspire. Therefore, in order to complete the Proposed Acquisition, the Directors will propose the investing policy is amended to allow the Company to take majority equity interests in investee companies. To implement the amended investing policy, shareholders will be required to approve a resolution at a general meeting of the Company. The Directors expect to put this resolution to shareholders at the annual general meeting of the Company which is to be held in the coming weeks. A further update will be provided in due course.\nJim McColl, Executive Director of Caledonian, commented:\n\"\nThe proposed acquisition of Aspire aligns with our strategy to build a scalable technology-enabled financial-services group. The interim funding ensures Aspire remains operationally stable ahead of completion and supports the platform we intend to develop.\n\"\nAdam Rigler, CEO of Aspire, commented:\n\"\nPartnering with Caledonian marks an important step for Aspire. The working-capital support gives us the stability to continue serving customers during the transition period, while aligning us with a long-term strategic partner committed to expanding our platform and capabilities.\n\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
