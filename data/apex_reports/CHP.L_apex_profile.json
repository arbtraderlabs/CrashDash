The second tranche of funding has been funded by the Company's existing cash resources.\nAspire has continued to build positive operational and commercial momentum since the initial funding was provided in November 2025. Following a record December for revenue, Aspire's supply chain finance pipeline has accelerated ahead of plan and its distribution channels continue to develop. In addition, a strategic partnership with a global liquidity partner is at an advanced stage, while discussions are underway with a Singapore-based investment platform. Aspire's platform is also being evaluated by a credit institution as a potential replacement onboarding solution, which could represent an additional future revenue stream.\nThe Board believes that continuing to meet agreed funding milestones as announced demonstrates Caledonian's commitment as a long-term and supportive partner and provides Aspire with the appropriate financial backing to execute its business plan.\nAll other terms of the funding arrangements remain unchanged.\nCompletion of the proposed acquisition of Aspire by the Company on the terms set out in the announcement of 26 November 2025 remains subject to:\n-\nreceipt of regulatory change-of-control approval from the FCA; and\n-\napproval by Caledonian shareholders of an amendment to the Company's investing policy to permit majority ownership of portfolio companies.\nAdam Rigler, CEO of Aspire, commented:\n\"Progress over the past three months underlines the exciting potential for Aspire, both domestically and internationally. Supply chain finance is becoming increasingly important to UK businesses, as reflected in recent UK Government initiatives. The continued digital transformation of supply chain operations, including payment systems and foreign exchange management, has positioned Aspire well to serve this growing market, particularly for UK businesses trading internationally.\"\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director of Caledonian Holdings plc, added:\n\"We are very pleased with the progress Aspire has made in a relatively short period of time following our initial investment. The pace of operational development and commercial engagement reinforces our confidence in the strategy and the management team. Advancing this second tranche on schedule reflects our commitment to supporting Aspire as it continues to execute against its growth plan.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 January 2026\nCaledonian Holdings plc\n(\"Caledonian\" or the \"Company\")\nFurther investment in AlbaCo Limited\nCaledonian Holdings plc is pleased to announce that it has entered into a further subscription agreement to provide short-term funding support to existing investee company, AlbaCo Limited (\"AlbaCo\" or \"Alba\"), to support the business through the ongoing banking licence assessment process.\nUnder the subscription agreement, Caledonian has committed \u00a3750,000 of funding to AlbaCo. This funding is in addition to the aggregate \u00a31.45 million investment in Alba announced by the Company on 7 October 2025 and 18 December 2025 and reflects Caledonian's continued conviction in Alba as a core portfolio investment.\nThe funds will be drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources.\nFunding terms\nThe funding will be provided on terms substantially consistent with Caledonian's previous short-term support arrangements announced on 7 October 2025 and 18 December 2025, including a 25% fee payable either in cash or in new ordinary shares in AlbaCo upon completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising. Warrants will also be issued to Caledonian conditional on,\ninter alia\n, completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising.\nCaledonian currently holds 1,500,000 shares in AlbaCo, representing 5.47% of AlbaCo's existing issued share capital.\nStrategic rationale\nCaledonian views AlbaCo as a core long-term investment. This additional funding:\n\u00b7\nsupports AlbaCo's operational continuity during the banking licence assessment process;\n\u00b7\nenables AlbaCo to maintain momentum across regulatory, operational and commercial workstreams; and\n\u00b7\nreinforces Caledonian's commitment as AlbaCo progresses towards potential authorisation and launch.\nThere can be no certainty that a banking licence will be granted, which remains subject to regulatory approval.\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are pleased to continue supporting AlbaCo at this important stage of its journey. Our funding terms are structured to ensure Caledonian's interests are fully protected and that our shareholders benefit from any future improvement in AlbaCo's capital-raising terms. We remain confident in AlbaCo's progress and believe this approach positions Caledonian to capture meaningful long-term value as the regulatory process advances.\"\nInformation on Alba\nAlba aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. Alba aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. Alba is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, Alba reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, Alba's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The fundraises and the recent facility put in place from Yorkville have\nstrengthened the Company's cash reserves to support the new strategy and has provided a strong foundation to carry out the first two investments as a financial services focused investing company.\nAs previously reported CHP made its first investment into AlbaCo\nLimited (\"AlbaCo\") in June 2025 and invested an aggregate of cash and shares totalling \u00a31,000,000 into AlbaCo. In October 2025 CHP announced that it had provided further support to AlbaCo with a subscription agreement totalling \u00a31,000,000 to support its near-term working capital requirements and the development of AlbaCo in securing its authorisation capital raise. This funding followed on from a \u00a3120,000 prepayment provided to AlbaCo in September 2025. The \u00a31m facility was drawn down in full by AlbaCo in October 2025 and November 2025. Furthermore, on 18 December 2025 we entered into a further subscription agreement to commit a further \u00a3450,000 as a prepayment towards\nour participation in Alba's forthcoming regulatory capital fundraising. The funds were drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources bringing the total funds advanced to AlbaCo since September 2025 to \u00a31.57 million.\nThe Board has continued to monitor the share prices of its listed/quoted investment portfolio and, where appropriate, has divested in whole or in part a number of investee companies, realising value where possible, and reducing legacy holdings to enable the Company to concentrate on building its new portfolio in financial services.\nTurning to the financials, the Company reported a loss for the year of \u00a3595,572 compared to a loss of \u00a32,736,882 in the comparable period. Almost all of this difference, from an accounting perspective, reflects a reduction in fair value of investments in the comparable period being reported on. Net assets increased to \u00a33,851,777 compared to \u00a32,873,720 at 30 September 2024 and cash increased from \u00a3787,336 at the beginning of the period to \u00a31,019,217 at the balance sheet date.\nSince the period end CHP has been successful in securing a \u00a33.5 million funding package from Yorkville, to help with further short term funding for AlbaCo, other investment opportunities and general working capital. Full details are set out in the Company's announcement of 14 November 2025.\nLast month we announced our second investment under the new strategy. We have entered a conditional agreement to acquire 100% of Aspire Commerce Group Limited which represents a significant step in delivering our strategy to build an integrated, technology-enabled financial services investment group. While our current\ninvesting policy does not allow for Caledonian to make investments which will cause the Company to hold a majority equity interest in an investee company, we are looking for shareholder support at the Company's upcoming annual general meeting to enable us to implement a new investing policy. Alongside the announcement of the conditional acquisition, Caledonian put in place a working capital funding facility of up to \u00a3600,000 with Aspire of which \u00a3300,000 has been advanced on the terms set out in the Company's announcement of 26 November 2025.\nThe Board will continue to update shareholders, in line with regulatory requirements, through announcements and other appropriate communications.\nThe directors would like to thank shareholders for their continued support and look forward to continuing to deliver this new strategy.\nBrent Fitzpatrick\nChairman\n23

2025\n1. General information\nCaledonian Holdings plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.\nThese unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" as adopted by the European Union and do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. This condensed set of financial statements has been prepared applying the accounting policies that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 and are presented in pounds sterling.\nThe comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 March 2025 have been extracted from the Company's statutory accounts which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and reported on by the Company's Auditors. Their report was unqualified and contained no statement under section 298 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\n2. Changes in accounting policy\nThe assessment of new standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective are not anticipated to have a material impact on the interim financial statements.\n3. Going concern\nThe Directors have considered the Company's activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, the financial position of the Company, and its cash flows and liquidity position, taking account of the current market conditions. This review has demonstrated that the Company shall continue to operate within its own resources.\nThe Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

This funding is in addition to the \u00a31.0 million investment in Alba announced by the Company on 7 October 2025 and reflects Caledonian's continued conviction in Alba as a core portfolio investment.\nFunding structure\nThe Company has today entered into a subscription agreement to commit \u00a3450,000 of funding to Alba as a prepayment towards Caledonian's participation in Alba's forthcoming regulatory capital fundraising. The funds will be drawn down by Alba immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources.\nThe facility will be provided on substantially the same terms as Caledonian's previous short-term support to Alba announced on 7 October 2025, with an accompanying 25% fee payable to Caledonian in cash or new ordinary shares in Alba upon completion of Alba's regulatory capital fundraising reflective of the nature and duration of the facility. Warrants will also be granted to Caledonian conditional on,\ninter alia\n, completion of Alba's regulatory capital fundraising.\nCaledonian currently holds 1,500,000 shares in Alba which is equivalent to 5.47% of Alba's existing issued share capital.\nStrategic Rationale\nCaledonian views Alba as a core long-term investment and continues to support the development of a modern, digitally-enabled UK challenger bank. The provision of this short-term funding:\n\u00b7\nsupports Alba's operational continuity during the ongoing banking licence assessment process;\n\u00b7\nenables the Alba business to maintain momentum across regulatory, operational and commercial workstreams; and\n\u00b7\nreinforces Caledonian's commitment to Alba as it progresses towards potential authorisation and launch.\nThere can be no certainty that a banking licence will be granted, which remains subject to regulatory approval.\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director, commented:\n\"This additional support reflects our continued confidence in Alba and the progress made across governance, systems and regulatory engagement. We believe it is appropriate to ensure the business remains well capitalised as it advances through the licensing process.\"\nJim McColl, Executive Director, added:\n\"Alba has made substantial progress this year in strengthening its business model, governance and funding position. This further support from Caledonian reflects our strong belief in the long-term opportunity and the high-quality team leading the Bank.\"\nInformation on Alba\nAlba aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. Alba aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. Alba is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, Alba reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, Alba's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Aspire provides a highly complementary platform that enables Caledonian to accelerate its fintech ambitions and deploy capital in areas requiring regulated infrastructure.\nThe Proposed Acquisition:\n\u00b7\nestablishes a core operating and technology platform\ncapable of supporting current accounts, FX, trade finance and business lending, giving Caledonian an immediate footprint in regulated financial-services infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nenables Caledonian to deploy complementary technologies and service lines\nwithout repeated regulatory approval cycles, materially shortening product development and time-to-market;\n\u00b7\ncreates a scalable base for an integrated fintech ecosystem\n, aligning with Caledonian's strategy to build capability across payments, lending, data and financial operations under one group structure;\n\u00b7\npreserves and stabilises value through the Facility\n, ensuring operational continuity during the transition period and protecting the underlying technology and customer pipeline;\n\u00b7\nprovides access to experienced operators and a developed technology stack\n, avoiding the cost, time and execution risk associated with building equivalent infrastructure internally; and\n\u00b7\nsupports a value-accretive restructuring\n, with Aspire's lenders indicating support for a long-dated repayment profile free from interest accrual, improving Aspire's financial resilience post-acquisition.\nThe Board of Caledonian believe that Aspire will serve as a foundational platform for Caledonian's financial-services strategy, enabling the Company to scale more efficiently and expand into adjacent fintech verticals.\nAspire\nAspire is a one stop shop for current accounts, business finance and foreign exchange transactions (FX). The company addresses the \u00a322bn UK trade finance gap through its proprietary technology and multi-asset ledger system, operating under the leadership of experienced financial business builders who have a proven track record within the payments and commercial lending markets.\nThe lending solutions, supported by fully functional current accounts and FX, all provided in-house, allow businesses to handle cash flow problems and pursue expansion opportunities which traditional lenders do not support.\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024, Aspire generated unaudited revenue of \u00a336,057 and reported a loss before tax of approximately \u00a33,993,389. As at 31 December 2024, Aspire's unaudited net liabilities were \u00a34,950,432.\nDebt position and lender support\nAs at 24 November 2025, Aspire's\nnon-current liabilities totalled \u00a39,489,804, largely comprising historic development funding used to build its technology platform.\nCaledonian has held discussions with Aspire's existing lenders, who have indicated support for a comprehensive post-completion restructuring of these liabilities. The restructuring, which will be part of the final agreed terms on the Proposed Acq",

Since its inception, Yorkville has structured and executed transactions totalling approximately $7.5 billion with more than 750 companies in 22 countries.\nStrategic Rationale\nThis combined funding structure provides Caledonian with:\n\u00b7\nImmediate equity capital\nto accelerate near-term investment into AlbaCo.\n\u00b7\nFlexible access to further funding\nto support operational growth and portfolio expansion.\n\u00b7\nReduced dilution risk\n, through premium conversion pricing, controlled issuance and strong market safeguards.\n\u00b7\nAlignment with long-term value creation\n, linking Yorkville's returns to the Company's market performance.\nTogether, the facilities strengthen Caledonian's financial position ahead of key regulatory and investment milestones and provide the flexibility to manage working capital without reliance on a single capital source.\nKey Terms\nEquity Subscription\nYA will subscribe \u00a3500,000 for 14,285,714,286 new ordinary shares (the \"\nSubscription Shares\n\") at a price of 0.0035 pence per Subscription Share, equivalent to the closing mid-market price of the Company's ordinary shares on 13 November 2025.\nThe Subscription Shares are being issued utilising the share authorities granted by Caledonian shareholders at the general meeting of the Company held on 12 September 2025.\nThe net proceeds from the Subscription, supplemented by certain existing cash resources, will be utilised by Caledonian to make an immediate further \u00a3500,000 investment into AlbaCo on the terms set out in the Company's announcement of 7 October 2025. This further drawdown by AlbaCo is expected to occur shortly and will complete Caledonian's subscription of \u00a31m into AlbaCo as a prepayment towards Caledonian's participation in AlbaCo's forthcoming authorisation capital raise. In addition to this \u00a31m investment, Caledonian holds 1,500,000 shares in AlbaCo which is equivalent to 5.47% of the AlbaCo's existing issued share capital.\nThe Subscription demonstrates institutional confidence in Caledonian's investment strategy and forms part of a broader funding partnership with Yorkville.\nConvertible Loan Note Facility\nThe key terms of the CLN are as follows:\n\u00b7\nPrincipal amount: \u00a33 million.\n\u00b7\nSecurity: the obligations of the Company under the CLN shall be unsecured.\n\u00b7\nMaturity date: 12 months with effect from 14 November 2025, being the closing date of the CLN.\n\u00b7\nInterest: 5% per annum, payable in line with amortisation.\n\u00b7\nConversion price: the CLN be converted into new ordinary shares in Caledonian at 0.0042 pence per share, representing a 20% premium to the closing mid-market share price on the trading day immediately prior to the completion date (being 13 November 2025) (the \"\nClosing Price\n\").\n\u00b7\nMonthly amortisation: \u00a3300,000 plus accrued interest per month over a 10 month period, begin",

In aggregate, Caledonian will receive 500,000 ordinary shares in AlbaCo, valued at \u00a3500,000, and will issue 12,500,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (the \"Consideration Shares\") to the Alba Shareholders (the \"Share Swap\").\nThe issue price of 0.0040 pence per Caledonian share represents a premium of\n45.45\n% to the Company's closing mid-market price of 0.00275p per Ordinary share on 30 October 2025. The Consideration Shares are being issued utilising the share authorities granted by Caledonian shareholders at the general meeting of the Company held on 6 August 2025.\nFollowing the Share Swap, Caledonian will hold 1,500,000 shares in AlbaCo which is equivalent to 5.47% of AlbaCo's existing issued share capital.\nRationale for the Share Swap\nThe Board believes the Share Swap strengthens the alignment between Caledonian and key AlbaCo shareholders and enhances Caledonian's investment position as AlbaCo continues to progress its business and licencing ambitions. The alignment via the Share Swap reinforces Caledonian's long-term commitment to AlbaCo and allows both parties to benefit from AlbaCo's future development while broadening Caledonian's shareholder base.\nSignificant shareholdings\nFollowing Admission, Moulsdale Investments Limited and Nevis Investments Limited will each be interested in 6,250,000,000 Ordinary Shares which is equivalent to a respective interest of\n5.40\n% of the Company's enlarged issued share capital (as enlarged by the issue of the Consideration Shares).\nCommunication via quarterly investment updates\nAs the Company continues to implement its revised strategy of focusing on the financial services sector, the Board has determined that it will no longer publish separate quarterly investment updates. The quarterly investment updates began in 2022 when the Company was pursuing a different strategy under a different management team. The Company intends instead to keep shareholders informed through regular announcements detailing investee company updates, as well as other operational updates as appropriate. The Board believes that this will ensure timelier communication of the Company's progress to shareholders and investors.\nAdmission and dealings\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the Consideration Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the Consideration Shares will commence at 8:00 a.m. on or around 5 November 2025.\nTotal Voting Rights\nOn Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will consist of Ordinary Shares, with one vote per share. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, on Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares and voting rights in the Company will be 115,767,796,702. With effect from Admission, this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nDavid Moulsdale, Director of Moulsdale Investments Limited, commented:\n\"We are delighted to commit our AlbaCo shareholding into Caledonian and look forward to supporting the Company's strategic journey as AlbaCo moves into full operations. This transaction signals our confidence in the combination of AlbaCo's momentum and Caledonian's investment platform.\"\nInformation on AlbaCo\nAlbaCo aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. AlbaCo aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. AlbaCo is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, AlbaCo reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, AlbaCo's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 79",

This funding provides near-term working capital for AlbaCo while ensuring Caledonian's position in the wider capitalisation process. The investment has been made on commercial terms that include warrant participation and associated fees, with the warrants to be issued and fees paid being conditional on,\ninter alia\n, completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising. This is consistent with Caledonian's strategy of securing attractive economics for its shareholders.\n\u00a3500,000 has been drawn down immediately by AlbaCo and has been satisfied by Caledonian from the Company's existing cash resources.\nThis funding follows on from a \u00a3120,000 prepayment that was provided by Caledonian to AlbaCo in September 2025. This earlier investment will be restated on the same commercial terms as today's prepayment, ensuring consistency across the Company's support for AlbaCo's growth plans.\nCaledonian has an existing 3.65 per cent. interest in AlbaCo's current issued share capital following on from the initial \u00a31 million investment made in cash and shares earlier this year.\nJim McColl, Executive Director of Caledonian Holdings plc, commented\n:\n\"We are pleased to provide this additional investment into AlbaCo at a pivotal point in its development. The working capital funding gives AlbaCo the time and flexibility it needs to finalise its institutional fundraising, while also strengthening our position as a supportive strategic shareholder. We believe AlbaCo has the potential to become an important new entrant in UK banking, and this investment demonstrates our continued commitment to its success.\"\nOutlook\nThe Board believes this further investment into AlbaCo represents an attractive opportunity to enhance Caledonian's exposure to the UK financial services sector, in line with its stated strategy. The Company looks forward to updating shareholders as AlbaCo progresses towards securing its unconditional banking licence and completing its fundraising.\nFurther to the announcements released by the Company on 12 September 2025 and 19 September 2025, Caledonian is also continuing discussions of its own with potential funding sources which, if successful, would enable Caledonian to participate further in AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising. Further updates will be released at the appropriate time.\nInformation on AlbaCo\nAlbaCo aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. AlbaCo aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. AlbaCo is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, AlbaCo reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, AlbaCo's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Over the past year, the Company has been through a period of significant transition.\nWith a new Board, new name and new investing policy, we have set a clear new course to reposition Caledonian as an active investor in the financial services sector\n.\nJust after the year end we concluded a successful fundraise to support this new direction. The placing shares were issued in March 2025 however the broker option and subscription shares were settled and issued in early April 2025. The Board\nconfirms its ongoing strategy of focusing on opportunities within the financial services sector, whilst also maintaining interest, support and engagement with our legacy investments.\nFurthermore, in July 2025, we successfully completed a second fundraise to further strengthen the cash reserves and support the new strategy. Combined, the fundraises have injected cash of approximately \u00a32 million into the Company and provide a strong foundation for executing our revised strategy.\nBoth during and after the year end the Board has carefully monitored the share prices of its listed/quoted investment portfolio and, where appropriate, has divested in whole or in part a number of investee companies, realising value where possible, and reducing legacy holdings to enable the Company to concentrate on building its new portfolio in financial services.\nTurning to the financials, the Company reported a loss for the year of \u00a34,370,513 compared to a loss of \u00a3776,537 in the previous comparable period. Almost all of this difference, from an accounting perspective, reflects a \u00a34,008,514 reduction in fair value of investments in the year being reported on, compared to a much smaller reduction in fair value in the previous financial year. Net assets decreased to \u00a32,873,720 compared to \u00a36,238,388 at 31 March 2024 and cash increased from \u00a353,597 at the beginning of the period to \u00a3787,336 at the balance sheet date.\nThe \u00a34,008,514 reduction in fair value of investments can be attributed in the main, to three investments, namely Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc, WeShop and Aeristech. During the period the fair value of Conduit fell from \u00a32,924,138 to \u00a36,079. Post year end the entire investment was sold. While the legacy portfolio, including Conduit, Aeristech and WeShop, has adversely impacted the Company's reported results, these setbacks underline the importance of the decisive shift in strategy now underway. The Company is no longer defined by these historic investments but by the opportunities we are pursuing in financial services.\nDuring the period under review the Company made further investments by way of convertible loan notes in both, Hamak Gold Limited and Igraine PLC, an existing investee company. Further details are disclosed in note 8 of the financial statements.\nDuring June to August 2025 the Company made its first investment in the financial services sector under the new strategy and invested an aggregate of cash and shares totalling \u00a31,000,000 into AlbaCo. Al\nbaCo aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential.\nAlbaCo is now in the final stages of raising their regulatory capital, and, as previously announced, Caledonian intends to participate further in that process.\nOur investment in AlbaCo exemplifies the kind of scalable, technology-enabled financial services business that will define Caledonian's future direction.\nAs part of the new strategy, in March 2025, the Board saw a change of personnel with James Normand and Emma Wilson stepping down as directors and Jim McColl and Chris Cooke joining the Board. Post year end the management team has been further strengthened with the appointment of Keith Barclay as Investment Director. I would like to thank James & Emma for their contribution to the Company during their appointments.\nThe Board will continue to update shareholders, in line with regulatory requirements, through announcements and other appropriate comm",

The Proposed Fundraising and any proposed further investment by Caledonian into AlbaCo remains conditional on AlbaCo raising a minimum of \u00a325 million of regulatory capital.\nIn order to prioritise engagement with certain institutional investors and providers of structured capital solutions, the Company, in conjunction with its advisers, has decided to step back at this stage from a wider marketing of the Proposed Fundraising. Whilst the Company has been introduced to a number of traditional public market investors as part of the Proposed Fundraising, the Board believes that at this stage, discussions focusing on institutional counterparties are better aligned with the Company's immediate objectives.\nShould terms with such institutional or other parties be agreed in the near future, the Company would give consideration to re-engaging with the other public market investors met during the Proposed Fundraising, to provide them with the opportunity to participate on the same terms where practicable. This approach is intended to balance institutional support with access for retail investors.\nAs indicated, Caledonian continues to hold constructive discussions with a number of significant funding sources which, should these be concluded, would enable the Company to make a further significant investment into AlbaCo and continue to progress its wider financial services investment strategy.\nThe Board remains confident in its ability to secure the additional capital required and will provide further updates as appropriate.\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall have the same meaning as in the announcement of 28 August 2025 unless otherwise defined herein.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In addition to the proposed fundraising, the Company is, following discussions with certain existing AlbaCo shareholders, progressing other ways to potentially increase its exposure in AlbaCo.\nWe remain excited by the prospects of our investment in AlbaCo following the recent\nregulatory authorisation from the PRA and FCA to become a licensed UK bank, subject to completion of its capital requirements.

The issue price represents a 15 per cent. premium to the Company's closing mid-market share price of 0.00375p on 9 June 2025, being the last practicable date prior to the Initial Announcement, and a 57 per cent. premium to the Company's closing mid-market price of 0.00275p on 12 August 2025.\nFollowing completion of the Share Swap, the Company holds 1,000,000 ordinary shares in AlbaCo which is equivalent to a holding of 3.65% of the current issued share capital of AlbaCo.\nAdmission\nApplication will be made shortly to the London Stock Exchange plc for the Consideration Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the Consideration Shares on AIM will commence at 8:00 a.m. on or around 18 August 2025.\nDirector holding\nFollowing Admission, Jim McColl will be interested in 13,797,101,449 ordinary shares of 0.001 pence each in the Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") which is equivalent to 13.36% of the Company's enlarged issued share capital (as enlarged by the Consideration Shares).\nThe FCA notification in relation to the Consideration Shares made in accordance with the requirements of the UK Market Abuse Regulation, is appended further below.\nRelated party transaction\nJim McColl is a director of the Company and was a substantial shareholder (as defined in the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"\nAIM Rules\n\")) of the Company within the past 12 months and as such is considered a related party of the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules. The entering into of the Share Swap by Jim McColl constitutes a related party transaction pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The Company's independent directors (being Brent Fitzpatrick and Chris Cooke), having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Allenby Capital Limited, consider that the terms of the Share Swap are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nTotal voting rights\nOn Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will consist of 103,267,796,702 Ordinary Shares, with one vote per share. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, on Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares and voting rights in the Company will be 103,267,796,702. With effect from Admission, this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nNotification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them.\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\nName\nPosition\nJames McColl\nExecutive Director\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\nSee above\nb)\nInitial notification /Amendment\nInitial notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName\nCaledonian Holdings PLC\nb)\nLEI\n213800SWFEORWAP84393\n4\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument\nIdentification code\nOrdinary shares of 0.001p each in Caledonian Holdings PLC\nIdentification code (ISIN) for Caledonian Holdings PLC ordinary shares of 0.001P each:\nGB00BYZ9XC29\nb)\nNature of the transaction\nIssue of ordinary shares as consideration pursuant to the Share Swap\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s)\nPrice(s) (penc",

AlbaCo aims to be Scotland's first bank solely dedicated to lending to small and medium sized businesses in Scotland and the wider UK regions.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\n\u00a3750,000 to be invested in AlbaCo in cash\n\u00b7\nIntention to invest a further \u00a3250,000 in AlbaCo in the form of new ordinary shares in Caledonian Holdings\n\u00b7\nCaledonian Holdings' first investment in the financial services sector following implementation of revised investing policy\nThe Company has entered into an agreement to invest \u00a3750,000 in AlbaCo through the purchase of 750,000 new ordinary shares in AlbaCo at a price of \u00a31.00 per share (the \"\nShare Purchase\n\"). The Share Purchase is to be satisfied in cash from the Company's existing cash resources. Completion of the Share Purchase is expected to occur upon payment of funds to AlbaCo in the coming days. On completion of the Share Purchase the Company is expected to have an interest in 2.73% of the issued share capital of AlbaCo.\nThe Company also intends to acquire 250,000 existing ordinary shares in AlbaCo at a price of \u00a31.00 per share through the issue of 5,797,101,449 new ordinary shares in the Company (the \"\nConsideration Shares\n\") at a price of 0.0043125p share (the \"\nShare Swap\n\", and together with the Share Purchase, the \"\nInvestment\n\"), being a 15 per cent. premium to the Company's closing mid-market share price of 0.00375p on 9 June 2025. Before proceeding with the Share Swap, the Company is required to commission a valuation report for the purposes of Section 593 of the Companies Act 2006 as the Company's intention is to issue the Consideration Shares for non-cash consideration. Pursuant to the Share Swap, the Company would be acquiring 250,000 shares in AlbaCo that are beneficially owned by Jim McColl, Executive Director of the Company.\nJim McColl (Executive Director and substantial shareholder of the Company) is the founder, a non-executive director and major shareholder in AlbaCo.\nThe Investment represents Caledonian Holdings first investment into the financial services sector following the fundraising, change of investing policy and board changes which took place earlier this year.\nRationale for Investment\nThe independent directors of Caledonian Holdings (being Chris Cooke and Brent Fitzpatrick) have met with the full executive team at AlbaCo as well the CEO and CFO specifically for the purpose of furthering due diligence on AlbaCo as part of the Investment.\nAlbaCo has a unique regional proposition and is utilising new technology, an experienced team, and are expounding a unique appeal to the under-served Scottish and provincial English and Welsh small and medium-sized enterprise (\"\nSME\n\") communities where the demand for a relationship with a customer-centric bank is high.\nAlbaCo has advantages over the big, established banks due to its bespoke technology developed solely for their unique purpose. It is also differentiated, as a result of a strong local and regional appeal with a central ethos of relationship banking and customer centricity. Their investment in customer relationship directors and managers and a dedicated team of customer facing people provides the platform for this approach. Focusing initially on Scotland and the north of England, AlbaCo intends to be strong in these areas where the SME community and independent business owners have been neglected and are keen for a supportive relationship with their financing partner.\nAlbaCo has the usual benefits of a challenger bank but with further differentiation through the strong regional appeal and the dedication to SMEs who are able to speak with people and not just chatbot and AI. It meets with a cross party belief in government that the access to strong financial advice and support is lacking for SMEs.\nThe Board of Caledonian Holdings believe that the financial prospects for AlbaCo are very encouraging and it is understood that these have been tested by the regulators as part of their licensing case. The award of a full banking\u00a0licence\u00a0is, we understand, imminent.\nSubstantial investment from successful Scottish business people, family offices, a former challenger bank founder, and a European capital investor has already been obtained by AlbaCo and the Board of Caledonian Holdings understands that discussions are under way and progressing very well for AlbaCo to raise additional funding upon, or following, receipt of a full banking licence.\nThe Investment is an important first step for Caledonian Holdings as a business with a new board, and a revised investing strategy focusin",

The Broker Option has raised \u00a3112,500 at the Issue Price of 0.0025p per share through the issue of 4,500,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (\"\nBroker Option Shares\n\"). In addition, recipients of Broker Option Shares have been granted one warrant for every two Broker Option Shares subscribed for, exercisable at a price of 0.0075p per warrant (the \"\nBroker Option Warrants\n\"), resulting in the issue of 2,250,000,000 Broker Option Warrants. The Broker Option Warrants are on the same terms as the Warrants issued pursuant to the Fundraising, as detailed in the Company's announcement of 4 March 2025.\nThe total amount raised by the Company pursuant to the Fundraising and the Broker Option is approximately \u00a31.2 million (before expenses).\nAdmission of the Placing Shares and issue of Warrants\nAdmission of the 33,080,000,000 Placing Shares is due to occur at 8.00 a.m. today (\"\nFirst Admission\n\").

          "full_content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 8643P\nCaledonian Holdings PLC\n22 January 2026\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK version of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 January 2026\nCaledonian Holdings plc\n(\"Caledonian\" or the \"Company\")\nFurther investment in AlbaCo Limited\nCaledonian Holdings plc is pleased to announce that it has entered into a further subscription agreement to provide short-term funding support to existing investee company, AlbaCo Limited (\"AlbaCo\" or \"Alba\"), to support the business through the ongoing banking licence assessment process.\nUnder the subscription agreement, Caledonian has committed \u00a3750,000 of funding to AlbaCo. This funding is in addition to the aggregate \u00a31.45 million investment in Alba announced by the Company on 7 October 2025 and 18 December 2025 and reflects Caledonian's continued conviction in Alba as a core portfolio investment.\nThe funds will be drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources.\nFunding terms\nThe funding will be provided on terms substantially consistent with Caledonian's previous short-term support arrangements announced on 7 October 2025 and 18 December 2025, including a 25% fee payable either in cash or in new ordinary shares in AlbaCo upon completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising. Warrants will also be issued to Caledonian conditional on,\ninter alia\n, completion of AlbaCo's regulatory capital fundraising.\nCaledonian currently holds 1,500,000 shares in AlbaCo, representing 5.47% of AlbaCo's existing issued share capital.\nStrategic rationale\nCaledonian views AlbaCo as a core long-term investment. This additional funding:\n\u00b7\nsupports AlbaCo's operational continuity during the banking licence assessment process;\n\u00b7\nenables AlbaCo to maintain momentum across regulatory, operational and commercial workstreams; and\n\u00b7\nreinforces Caledonian's commitment as AlbaCo progresses towards potential authorisation and launch.\nThere can be no certainty that a banking licence will be granted, which remains subject to regulatory approval.\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are pleased to continue supporting AlbaCo at this important stage of its journey. Our funding terms are structured to ensure Caledonian's interests are fully protected and that our shareholders benefit from any future improvement in AlbaCo's capital-raising terms. We remain confident in AlbaCo's progress and believe this approach positions Caledonian to capture meaningful long-term value as the regulatory process advances.\"\nInformation on Alba\nAlba aims to be a new bank with a clear vision and purpose - to support small and medium-sized businesses as they develop their aspirations, grow and realise their potential. Alba aims to help SMEs grow by applying specialist expertise and insight while forming strong and lasting relationships with its customers. Alba is not yet open to trade pending full regulatory banking approval.\nFor the year ended 29 February 2024, Alba reported a loss after tax of approximately \u00a38.96 million. As at 29 February 2024, Alba's net assets were \u00a36.31 million.\nFor further information, see\nalbacoltd.co.uk\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

It has the vision, the funding, the management and the operational requirements ( Aspire ). We are awaiting FCA approval. From my experience this normally takes around 60 days which if our application was submitted at the time of the Aspire acquisition would take us to the end of this month. We also need shareholder approval so I would expect an announcement around the same time. Patience is a virtue. Im just happy that all of this scaremongering is allowing me more time to buy more shares. Take care\u2026\u2026",

We never knew about the deal with Aspire but  the charts signalled that there could be short term weakness, so again my friend I seem to be spot on, try not to vomit to much. Lol. It will be a good sign if the share price recovers and finishes at 0.0050 or 0,0051 today. Good luck to everyone.",

It has the vision, the funding, the management and the operational requirements ( Aspire ). We are awaiting FCA approval. From my experience this normally takes around 60 days which if our application was submitted at the time of the Aspire acquisition would take us to the end of this month. We also need shareholder approval so I would expect an announcement around the same time. Patience is a virtue. Im just happy that all of this scaremongering is allowing me more time to buy more shares. Take care\u2026\u2026",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

The second tranche of funding has been funded by the Company's existing cash resources.\nAspire has continued to build positive operational and commercial momentum since the initial funding was provided in November 2025. Following a record December for revenue, Aspire's supply chain finance pipeline has accelerated ahead of plan and its distribution channels continue to develop. In addition, a strategic partnership with a global liquidity partner is at an advanced stage, while discussions are underway with a Singapore-based investment platform. Aspire's platform is also being evaluated by a credit institution as a potential replacement onboarding solution, which could represent an additional future revenue stream.\nThe Board believes that continuing to meet agreed funding milestones as announced demonstrates Caledonian's commitment as a long-term and supportive partner and provides Aspire with the appropriate financial backing to execute its business plan.\nAll other terms of the funding arrangements remain unchanged.\nCompletion of the proposed acquisition of Aspire by the Company on the terms set out in the announcement of 26 November 2025 remains subject to:\n-\nreceipt of regulatory change-of-control approval from the FCA; and\n-\napproval by Caledonian shareholders of an amendment to the Company's investing policy to permit majority ownership of portfolio companies.\nAdam Rigler, CEO of Aspire, commented:\n\"Progress over the past three months underlines the exciting potential for Aspire, both domestically and internationally. Supply chain finance is becoming increasingly important to UK businesses, as reflected in recent UK Government initiatives. The continued digital transformation of supply chain operations, including payment systems and foreign exchange management, has positioned Aspire well to serve this growing market, particularly for UK businesses trading internationally.\"\nKeith Barclay, Investment Director of Caledonian Holdings plc, added:\n\"We are very pleased with the progress Aspire has made in a relatively short period of time following our initial investment. The pace of operational development and commercial engagement reinforces our confidence in the strategy and the management team. Advancing this second tranche on schedule reflects our commitment to supporting Aspire as it continues to execute against its growth plan.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nCaledonian Holdings plc\nJim McColl, Executive Director\nBrent Fitzpatrick, Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0) 7950 389469\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nNick Athanas / Piers Shimwell\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "The \"Jim McColl factor\" in this context refers to the influential role of Scottish industrialist Jim McColl as a common link and primary driver between Caledonian Holdings PLC (CHP) and AlbaCo Ltd (the parent of Alba Bank). The core of this relationship involves: Cross-Directorship and Ownership: Jim McColl serves as an Executive Director and major shareholder of Caledonian Holdings (CHP) while also being the founder, director, and substantial shareholder of AlbaCo Ltd. Strategic Investment: Under McColl's guidance, CHP pivoted its strategy to focus on financial services, leading to a \u00a31 million investment in AlbaCo in June 2025. Related Party Transactions: Because of McColl's dual involvement, these deals are classified as Related Party Transactions under AIM Rules. This includes a share swap where CHP issued billions of new shares to acquire AlbaCo stock directly from McColl. Recent Funding: As of early 2026, CHP has continued to provide short-term funding (e.g., a further \u00a3750,000 injection) to support AlbaCo as it nears the final stages of its banking licence application. Market Proposition: McColl's \"factor\" is his vision of \"high touch - high tech\" relationship banking, aiming to fill a perceived funding gap for SMEs in Scotland and the UK",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",

          "content": "Hi guys thought ill post some info for new investors and old alike cheers Alba Bank, a UK-based challenger bank, shows potential through its specialized focus on the underserved Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and its advanced technological foundations. The bank\u2019s potential is supported by several key factors: Strategic Market Focus Underserved SME Sector: Alba Bank aims to fill a significant funding gap in the UK, where over half of SMEs have reported difficulties in securing sufficient funding. Regional Presence: As a Scottish-based bank, it is positioned as the first of its kind in Scotland solely dedicated to SME lending, providing a localized alternative to traditional major banks. \"High-Touch, High-Tech\" Model: The bank combines a digitally-optimized platform with personalized relationship management, addressing a common SME pain point: the loss of human interaction in \"industrialized\" traditional banking. Operational Readiness & Technology Banking License: Alba has secured its banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing it to move into the mobilization phase as of early 2026. Cloud-First Infrastructure: By partnering with industry leaders like Mambu (core banking) and nCino (cloud banking platform), Alba is building a scalable and agile system designed for rapid product deployment and quick lending decisions. Strategic Partnerships: The bank has linked with ClearBank to manage real-time payments and clearing, ensuring operational readiness for SMEs. Leadership and Backing Experienced Team: Its leadership includes veteran figures with decades of experience at major institutions like Santander, Metro Bank, and Lloyds Banking Group. Solid Backing: The bank was founded by entrepreneur Jim McColl and is supported by Clyde Blowers Capital, providing both specialized expertise and initial capital for development. Investment Outlook As of January 2026, market discussions suggest Alba's long-term value will depend on its ability to scale its relationship model against larger rivals like Starling and Monzo. Some investors view it as a high-upside opportunity, ranking it as a strong competitor among newer funded challenger banks.",
