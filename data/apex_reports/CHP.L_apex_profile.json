The fundraises and the recent facility put in place from Yorkville have\nstrengthened the Company's cash reserves to support the new strategy and has provided a strong foundation to carry out the first two investments as a financial services focused investing company.\nAs previously reported CHP made its first investment into AlbaCo\nLimited (\"AlbaCo\") in June 2025 and invested an aggregate of cash and shares totalling \u00a31,000,000 into AlbaCo. In October 2025 CHP announced that it had provided further support to AlbaCo with a subscription agreement totalling \u00a31,000,000 to support its near-term working capital requirements and the development of AlbaCo in securing its authorisation capital raise. This funding followed on from a \u00a3120,000 prepayment provided to AlbaCo in September 2025. The \u00a31m facility was drawn down in full by AlbaCo in October 2025 and November 2025. Furthermore, on 18 December 2025 we entered into a further subscription agreement to commit a further \u00a3450,000 as a prepayment towards\nour participation in Alba's forthcoming regulatory capital fundraising. The funds were drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources bringing the total funds advanced to AlbaCo since September 2025 to \u00a31.57 million.\nThe Board has continued to monitor the share prices of its listed/quoted investment portfolio and, where appropriate, has divested in whole or in part a number of investee companies, realising value where possible, and reducing legacy holdings to enable the Company to concentrate on building its new portfolio in financial services.\nTurning to the financials, the Company reported a loss for the year of \u00a3595,572 compared to a loss of \u00a32,736,882 in the comparable period. Almost all of this difference, from an accounting perspective, reflects a reduction in fair value of investments in the comparable period being reported on. Net assets increased to \u00a33,851,777 compared to \u00a32,873,720 at 30 September 2024 and cash increased from \u00a3787,336 at the beginning of the period to \u00a31,019,217 at the balance sheet date.\nSince the period end CHP has been successful in securing a \u00a33.5 million funding package from Yorkville, to help with further short term funding for AlbaCo, other investment opportunities and general working capital. Full details are set out in the Company's announcement of 14 November 2025.\nLast month we announced our second investment under the new strategy. We have entered a conditional agreement to acquire 100% of Aspire Commerce Group Limited which represents a significant step in delivering our strategy to build an integrated, technology-enabled financial services investment group. While our current\ninvesting policy does not allow for Caledonian to make investments which will cause the Company to hold a majority equity interest in an investee company, we are looking for shareholder support at the Company's upcoming annual general meeting to enable us to implement a new investing policy. Alongside the announcement of the conditional acquisition, Caledonian put in place a working capital funding facility of up to \u00a3600,000 with Aspire of which \u00a3300,000 has been advanced on the terms set out in the Company's announcement of 26 November 2025.\nThe Board will continue to update shareholders, in line with regulatory requirements, through announcements and other appropriate communications.\nThe directors would like to thank shareholders for their continued support and look forward to continuing to deliver this new strategy.\nBrent Fitzpatrick\nChairman\n23

The fundraises and the recent facility put in place from Yorkville have\nstrengthened the Company's cash reserves to support the new strategy and has provided a strong foundation to carry out the first two investments as a financial services focused investing company.\nAs previously reported CHP made its first investment into AlbaCo\nLimited (\"AlbaCo\") in June 2025 and invested an aggregate of cash and shares totalling \u00a31,000,000 into AlbaCo. In October 2025 CHP announced that it had provided further support to AlbaCo with a subscription agreement totalling \u00a31,000,000 to support its near-term working capital requirements and the development of AlbaCo in securing its authorisation capital raise. This funding followed on from a \u00a3120,000 prepayment provided to AlbaCo in September 2025. The \u00a31m facility was drawn down in full by AlbaCo in October 2025 and November 2025. Furthermore, on 18 December 2025 we entered into a further subscription agreement to commit a further \u00a3450,000 as a prepayment towards\nour participation in Alba's forthcoming regulatory capital fundraising. The funds were drawn down by AlbaCo immediately and satisfied from the Company's existing cash resources bringing the total funds advanced to AlbaCo since September 2025 to \u00a31.57 million.\nThe Board has continued to monitor the share prices of its listed/quoted investment portfolio and, where appropriate, has divested in whole or in part a number of investee companies, realising value where possible, and reducing legacy holdings to enable the Company to concentrate on building its new portfolio in financial services.\nTurning to the financials, the Company reported a loss for the year of \u00a3595,572 compared to a loss of \u00a32,736,882 in the comparable period. Almost all of this difference, from an accounting perspective, reflects a reduction in fair value of investments in the comparable period being reported on. Net assets increased to \u00a33,851,777 compared to \u00a32,873,720 at 30 September 2024 and cash increased from \u00a3787,336 at the beginning of the period to \u00a31,019,217 at the balance sheet date.\nSince the period end CHP has been successful in securing a \u00a33.5 million funding package from Yorkville, to help with further short term funding for AlbaCo, other investment opportunities and general working capital. Full details are set out in the Company's announcement of 14 November 2025.\nLast month we announced our second investment under the new strategy. We have entered a conditional agreement to acquire 100% of Aspire Commerce Group Limited which represents a significant step in delivering our strategy to build an integrated, technology-enabled financial services investment group. While our current\ninvesting policy does not allow for Caledonian to make investments which will cause the Company to hold a majority equity interest in an investee company, we are looking for shareholder support at the Company's upcoming annual general meeting to enable us to implement a new investing policy. Alongside the announcement of the conditional acquisition, Caledonian put in place a working capital funding facility of up to \u00a3600,000 with Aspire of which \u00a3300,000 has been advanced on the terms set out in the Company's announcement of 26 November 2025.\nThe Board will continue to update shareholders, in line with regulatory requirements, through announcements and other appropriate communications.\nThe directors would like to thank shareholders for their continued support and look forward to continuing to deliver this new strategy.\nBrent Fitzpatrick\nChairman\n23
