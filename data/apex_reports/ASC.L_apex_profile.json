Resolution 19 was a special resolution relating to the Company's ability to call a General Meeting, other than AGMs, on 14 clear days' notice. Although the Board considered the flexibility afforded by these authorities to be in the best interests of the Company, it took the decision to withdraw Resolutions 18 and 19 from the agenda of the AGM, following further engagement with some of the Company's shareholders. The Company will continue its engagement with shareholders on the resolutions.\nASOS Chair, Natasja Laheij, commented on the vote:\n''We are pleased that all resolutions put to the meeting were supported by a significant majority of shareholders. We remain committed to the transformation strategy the management team is implementing. ASOS made meaningful progress against its plans in FY25, and we are confident in our continued progress in the year ahead. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders, with a clear focus on driving long\u2011term shareholder value.''\nFull details of the\u00a0resolutions are available in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on the Company's website:\nwww.asosplc.com\n.\nAs at the date of the AGM, the Company's issued and fully paid share capital consists of\n119,613,848\nOrdinary Shares with a nominal value of 3.5 pence each (\"Ordinary Shares\"), with one voting right per share. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in Treasury. The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore\n119,613,848\n.\nIn accordance with Listing Rule 9.6.2, copies of the resolutions that do not constitute ordinary business at an annual general meeting have been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\n.\nFor further information:\nASOS plc\nTel: 020 7756 1000\nAlex Dent, Deputy Company Secretary\nWebsite: www.asosplc.com/investors\nTeneo\nTel: 0\n20 7353 4200\nJonathan Sibun / Will Palfreyman\nBackground note\nFounded in 2000, ASOS has 17m active customers in over 150 markets.
