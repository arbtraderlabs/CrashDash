Resolution 19 was a special resolution relating to the Company's ability to call a General Meeting, other than AGMs, on 14 clear days' notice. Although the Board considered the flexibility afforded by these authorities to be in the best interests of the Company, it took the decision to withdraw Resolutions 18 and 19 from the agenda of the AGM, following further engagement with some of the Company's shareholders. The Company will continue its engagement with shareholders on the resolutions.\nASOS Chair, Natasja Laheij, commented on the vote:\n''We are pleased that all resolutions put to the meeting were supported by a significant majority of shareholders. We remain committed to the transformation strategy the management team is implementing. ASOS made meaningful progress against its plans in FY25, and we are confident in our continued progress in the year ahead. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders, with a clear focus on driving long\u2011term shareholder value.''\nFull details of the\u00a0resolutions are available in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on the Company's website:\nwww.asosplc.com\n.\nAs at the date of the AGM, the Company's issued and fully paid share capital consists of\n119,613,848\nOrdinary Shares with a nominal value of 3.5 pence each (\"Ordinary Shares\"), with one voting right per share. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in Treasury. The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore\n119,613,848\n.\nIn accordance with Listing Rule 9.6.2, copies of the resolutions that do not constitute ordinary business at an annual general meeting have been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\n.\nFor further information:\nASOS plc\nTel: 020 7756 1000\nAlex Dent, Deputy Company Secretary\nWebsite: www.asosplc.com/investors\nTeneo\nTel: 0\n20 7353 4200\nJonathan Sibun / Will Palfreyman\nBackground note\nFounded in 2000, ASOS has 17m active customers in over 150 markets.

As well as offering improved financial terms, it better positions us to deliver on the final phase of our turnaround strategy and growth plans with greater confidence and resilience.\"\nNotes:\nThe new financing facilities (the \"Facilities\") comprise a \u00a3150m term loan and an \u00a387.5m DDTL with a syndicate of private lenders and are committed for a five-year term, maturing in November 2030.\nThe new Facilities provide a substantial increase in the Company's effective liquidity headroom of \u00a387.5m through a replacement \u00a3150m term loan and access to a committed and readily available DDTL facility, effectively replacing the existing \u00a375m Revolving Credit Facility and \u00a350m accordion facilities, due 2027, which had \u00a3nil availability in the prior reporting period.\nFor further information:\nASOS plc\nEmily MacLeod, Head of Strategy & Investor Relations\nTel: 020 7756 1000\nTeneo\nJonathan Sibun / Will Palfreyman\nTel: 020 7353 4200\nAbout ASOS\nFounded in 2000, ASOS has 18m active customers in over 200 markets.

Its deliberate, multi-year turnaround has involved three distinct but overlapping stages:\n1)\nDealing with the legacy of the old model\n: ASOS first addressed the significant legacy issues to improve its capital allocation - successfully clearing its excess stock, reducing its warehouse footprint and strengthening the balance sheet.\n2)\nBuilding the new commercial model\n: At the same time, ASOS also transitioned to a comprehensively more disciplined, agile way of working, retooling the way it operates - from how it designs and buys product, to how it manages stock newness and returns - to deliver healthier full-price sales.\nThe Company has also undertaken a more targeted approach to its customer proposition by market, a disciplined business-wide review and subsequent renegotiation of key supplier contracts, and a structural reset of its fixed cost base to support its new model, creating the headroom to reinvest in growth. Together, these changes establish a structurally higher gross margin profile and stronger, more profitable underlying economic model that ASOS can grow in a sustainable fashion.\n3)\nRe-engaging customers:\nWith stronger foundations in place, the final phase is regaining the hearts and minds of customers at scale, starting with its core customers in its core markets.\nAs it entered FY25, ASOS had essentially completed phase one, having significantly reduced and comprehensively refinanced its net debt at the beginning of the year, announcing further efficiencies to its global distribution network with the mothballing of its Atlanta fulfilment centre, and reducing its inventory position by more than 60% since the end of FY22 (from \u00a31.1bn to c.\u00a3400m). Having concurrently scaled its new commercial model and rebuilt its variable and fixed cost base - stage two of this process - it had planned to shift gears to the final stage earlier in FY25. Instead, more opportunity to reduce fixed costs and drive further variable cost optimisation were explored and the business focus remained on securing even stronger profitability foundations that will deliver further material improvements to ASOS' cost base in FY26 and beyond.\nOver the summer ASOS pivoted to the final phase of its transformation, launching the start of a series of new customer experiences - including its exclusive adidas x ASOS collaboration, the ASOS.WORLD loyalty program in the UK, and expanding Topshop and Topman through new channels - with positive early signs on customer engagement. In FY26, building customer love is the primary focus for ASOS' energy, investment and resources. ASOS enters this exciting phase of its transformation with a business model, stock profile and underlying cost base that positions it to succeed, with more new customer experiences to come.\nASOS' financial performance in FY25 reflects the success of its strategic progress:\n\u00b7\nGross profit margins up c.350bps\nYoY, driven by the successful commercial model implementation, focusing on higher full-price sales mix and lower markdown activity.\n\u00b7\nScaling strategic models:\nIn FY25, Test & React reached more than 20% of own-brand sales, and flexible fulfilment reached 10% of third-party GMV, enabling it to bring customers the best, most relevant product faster and more efficiently.\n\u00b7\nOperational and cost efficiencies delivered\nmeaningful improvements particularly across its supply chain, through a series of wide-ranging initiatives including reducing the causes of unnecessary returns, renegotiation of key distribution contracts and optimising its warehouse footprint, leading to significant multi-year savings in FY26 and beyond. Distribution and warehousing cost-to-serve is down c.3ppts over the last two years, with further opportunities identified.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA up more than 60%\nYoY, expected to be towards the lower end of the \u00a3130m to \u00a3150m guided range, driven by higher gross margin and continued cost efficiency, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 5%, in line with consensus.\nDuring H2, ASOS delivered meaningful cost actions which, while not delivering a material benefit during the period, have permanently lowered ASOS' exit cost base, positioning the Company to realise significant annualised savings in FY26\n.\n\u00b7\nProfitability improvements delivered amidst lower sales\n:\nLower than expected GMV, with group revenue slightly below consensus estimates, as the Company continues to focus on higher quality sales against a soft consumer backdrop.\n\u00b7\nProfit per order\nincreased by c.30%\nYoY, underscoring the fundamental reset in unit economics achieved through focusing on creating sustainably profitable relationships with customers.\n\u00b7\nFree cash flow:\nDelivered a modest free cash inflow in FY25, ahead of broadl",

In his tenure at ASOS, most recently as Director of Group Finance, Aaron has been instrumental in driving a comprehensive cost-efficiency programme, demonstrating a relentless focus on operational improvements and improving customer experiences.\nHis leadership has supported the successful refinancing of the business and reshaped the Group's approach to resource allocation, aligning financial investments more closely with strategic priorities.\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Ramos Calamonte, ASOS CEO, said:\n\"\nNow is the time to further strengthen our focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth and better customer experiences.\nAaron has a strong track record of delivering operational efficiency and strategic thinking which will be key to continuing our successful transformation. I am confident that his experience and skills will be a great asset as CFO in the next phase of our journey.\"\n\"Dave has played an important role in helping lay the foundations for the next phase of our journey, having successfully overseen our refinancing and stock reduction. We are a significantly stronger and more resilient business than when he joined and I would like to express my sincerest appreciation on behalf of all ASOSers.\"\nJ\u00f8rgen Lindemann, ASOS Chair, said:\n\"I am pleased to welcome Aaron to the Board as Chief Financial Officer. We have been impressed with his ability to drive change at speed and are excited to see him continue the great work he has been doing, with his deep knowledge of ASOS' operations. This transition underscores ASOS' commitment to long-term strategic execution and value creation.\"\n\"\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Dave for his hard work and contribution to ASOS and we wish him the very best for the future.\"\nNotes:\nDave Murray will step down as CFO and Executive Director on 30 June 2025.\nThere are no other details that are required to be disclosed under 6.4.8R of the UK Listing Rules with respect to the appointment of Aaron Izzard.\nFor further information:\nASOS plc\nEmily MacLeod, Head of Strategy & Investor Relations\nTel: 020 7756 1000\nTeneo\nJonathan Sibun / Will Palfreyman\nTel: 020 7353 4200\nAbout ASOS\nFounded in 2000, ASOS has 18m active customers in over 200 markets.

Variable contribution increased c.30% YoY, supported by higher gross margin and better order economics. Total fixed costs held broadly flat in absolute terms, demonstrating strong cost control, effectively offsetting inflation.\n\u00b7\nCustomers responding well to increased newness and speed to market.\nGross margin up c.500bps YoY in H1, driven by lower markdown activity and higher full-price mix, demonstrating strength of new commercial model offering. In UK, our largest market, ASOS Design total sales +9% YoY in H1, growing market share5, enabled by market-leading Test & React ('T&R') and investments into quality. Globally own brand full-price sales returned to YoY growth in H1.\n\u00b7\nSales trajectory developing as expected.\nIn line with guidance, H1 revenues declined -13%, a continuation of FY24 trends, driven by annualising declines in old inventory (stock c.30% YoY), and optimised performance marketing.\n\u00b7\nSignificant progress on key strategic initiatives\n. Successfully scaled T&R to >15% of own-brand sales, on track for 20% FY target. Flexible Fulfilment ('FF') models now at c.7% of third-party GMV6, with major new market and partner launches set for H2. Added exciting new brands including Bimba y Lola, Jimmy Fairly and Oh Polly, with more than 25 new brand partners in H1, and a further 40 set to launch in H2, as well as more exclusive collections.\n\u00b7\nExciting pipeline of innovation ahead.\nEmbedded new organisational structure in H1, designed to accelerate decision-making and empower culture of continuous innovation. In H2, initiatives include launching Topshop.com, ASOS.WORLD loyalty program, live shopping features, enhanced search and personalisation, as well as further leveraging AI across the business, including through our AI stylist and addressing causes of unnecessary returns.\n\u00b7\nUS proposition improvement.\nUS customers now accessing greater product range via UK fulfilment, following changes to our global distribution model. Early response has been strong, with double-digit run-rate sales improvement and significantly higher full-price mix. From H2, full hybrid US model in will be in operation, including a smaller, more flexible local site and Partner Fulfils roll-out. Largely non-cash c.\u00a3180m adjusting item recorded in H1 related to the Atlanta site closure. Continue to expect c.\u00a310-20m annual EBITDA benefit from FY26. We continue to closely monitor the evolving US tariff outlook and see opportunity to respond as necessary through improved agility and flexibility of our sourcing and distribution model.\n\u00b7\nFree cash outflow driven by a return to normal seasonality\nof intake, with an H1 net working capital ('NWC') outflow. Stock health continues to improve, with inventory cover down c.15%, and sell-through up YoY. Continue to expect a significant free cash inflow in H2, driven by higher profitability and NWC inflow, to deliver broadly neutral FCF in FY25. We are confident in delivering meaningful FCF generation in FY26.\n\u00b7\nNet debt reduction.\nBalance sheet significantly strengthened through a comprehensive refinancing and proceeds from the formation of the Topshop and Topman joint venture ('TSTM JV')7 in Q1 FY25.\n\u00b7\nRe-iterating FY25 profitability guidance.\nDriven by a significant increase in our full-price sales mix, we continue to expect gross margin of at least 46% and adjusted EBITDA to increase by at least 60% to \u00a3130m to \u00a3150m. For FY25, we expect revenue growth towards the bottom end of consensus range8. FY25 GMV growth expected to be 1-2ppts better than revenue growth given scaling FF models.\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Ramos Calamonte, Chief Executive Officer said:\n\"H1 FY25 is the strongest sign yet that our new commercial model is working. We are driving a significant transformation in profitability, with positive adjusted EBITDA up by c.\u00a360m YoY. Customers are responding positively to our focus on full-price sales, speed to market, and quality,",

With success over FY23 and FY24 in reducing stock levels by c.50% and launching its new commercial model which requires lower stock holding, ASOS can offer better access to product for its global customer base while further reducing its distribution capacity and increasing the efficiency of its operations.\nHaving successfully transformed the US into a profitable market over FY24, ASOS sees further opportunity to re-invest in the areas that matter most to its customers by optimising its global distribution model.\nFrom H2 FY25, US customers will be served from ASOS' automated UK fulfilment centre in Barnsley, and through a smaller, more flexible local US site. This will offer ASOS' US customers an enhanced product offering, including a broader assortment and faster speed to market of the best and most exciting product, while offering competitive delivery speeds and lowering the total fulfilment cost per order. ASOS will also roll-out Partner Fulfils in the US in FY25, further broadening the breadth and depth of the best product from our partner brands.\nAs such, ASOS will mothball its Atlanta distribution centre in H2 FY25 and will formally market the site following the completion of the multi-year warehouse automation project. Seven ASOS employees directly affected by the change in operations will be offered alternative roles where feasible, and third-party logistics partners will make efforts to redeploy several hundred staff to nearby sites.\nAs a result of these operating changes, ASOS expects a \u00a310-20m annualised EBITDA benefit from FY26 onwards, assuming a reduction in US de minimis thresholds, and a similar benefit to free cash flow from FY26 onwards, with potential for additional working capital benefits. In FY25, it expects the impact on adjusted EBITDA to be broadly neutral. ASOS expects c.\u00a3190m of adjusting items predominantly relating to non-cash fixed asset impairments, resulting in a corresponding negative impact on reported profit. The impact on FY25 free cash flow is expected to be broadly neutral. ASOS re-iterates all other FY25 and medium-term guidance.\nASOS remains excited about the opportunity in the US market and believes that its new operating model will better serve its US customer-base, while generating a better return on investment.

Resolution 19 was a special resolution relating to the Company's ability to call a General Meeting, other than AGMs, on 14 clear days' notice. Although the Board considered the flexibility afforded by these authorities to be in the best interests of the Company, it took the decision to withdraw Resolutions 18 and 19 from the agenda of the AGM, following further engagement with some of the Company's shareholders. The Company will continue its engagement with shareholders on the resolutions.\nASOS Chair, Natasja Laheij, commented on the vote:\n''We are pleased that all resolutions put to the meeting were supported by a significant majority of shareholders. We remain committed to the transformation strategy the management team is implementing. ASOS made meaningful progress against its plans in FY25, and we are confident in our continued progress in the year ahead. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders, with a clear focus on driving long\u2011term shareholder value.''\nFull details of the\u00a0resolutions are available in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on the Company's website:\nwww.asosplc.com\n.\nAs at the date of the AGM, the Company's issued and fully paid share capital consists of\n119,613,848\nOrdinary Shares with a nominal value of 3.5 pence each (\"Ordinary Shares\"), with one voting right per share. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in Treasury. The total number of voting rights in the Company is therefore\n119,613,848\n.\nIn accordance with Listing Rule 9.6.2, copies of the resolutions that do not constitute ordinary business at an annual general meeting have been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\n.\nFor further information:\nASOS plc\nTel: 020 7756 1000\nAlex Dent, Deputy Company Secretary\nWebsite: www.asosplc.com/investors\nTeneo\nTel: 0\n20 7353 4200\nJonathan Sibun / Will Palfreyman\nBackground note\nFounded in 2000, ASOS has 17m active customers in over 150 markets.

The \"Battleground\" for ASOS You aren't just riding with Camelot; you have two \"Whales\" fighting over this stock: 1. Camelot (15.5%): Buying for long-term recovery. 2. Anders Holch Povlsen (28%+): The Danish billionaire who just increased his stake last week. He is sitting right at the 30% limit. If he buys more, he has to make a mandatory takeover bid for the whole company.",

The reason it's hard to find a single headline today is that it happened alongside a flurry of other ASOS news.

ASOS shares surged over 10% as traders realized he is now only 2% away from the 30% \"Mandatory Bid\" threshold. \u2022 Friday: Mike Ashley (Frasers Group) responded immediately by increasing his own stake to 25.13%.",

ASOS shares surged over 10% as traders realized he is now only 2% away from the 30% \"Mandatory Bid\" threshold. \u2022 Friday: Mike Ashley (Frasers Group) responded immediately by increasing his own stake to 25.13%.",
