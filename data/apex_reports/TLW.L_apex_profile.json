In 1994, he joined Trafigura Group as an executive where he had an integral role in the development of the group's oil trading activities, primarily in West Africa. In 2006, he founded his own company, Delaney Petroleum Ltd, trading crude oil and petroleum products predominantly in West Africa and the Middle East. He then returned for a three-year term with Trafigura Group in Geneva and remained an advisor at the company until the end of 2021.\nRoald has served on the Board of Tullow as an independent non-executive Director since February 2023, where he has also been a member of the Audit and Remuneration committees.\nHe is a long-term supporter of Tullow, holding 28,259,396 shares and c.$400,000 2026 Senior Notes.\nRoald is replacing\nPhuthuma Nhleko, who has notified the Board he is stepping down with immediate effect as Chair and non-executive director to focus on other business interests. In addition, Genevieve Sangudi, Martin Greenslade and Mitchell Ingram have also notified the Board they are stepping down with immediate effect as independent non-executive directors of the Board. The Company intends to replace key positions on the Board, whilst retaining a small, focused and aligned Board going forward. Further announcements will be made in due course.\nThe significant reduction in the size of the Board1 will result in a further reduction of Tullow's cost base.\n1\nAs of 1 December 2025 the Board consists of Roald Goethe (Independent Non-Executive Chair of the Board), Rebecca Wiles (Independent Non-Executive Director), Ian Perks (Chief Executive Officer) and Richard Miller (Chief Financial Officer).\nRoald Goethe, Chair of Tullow Oil Plc, said:\n\"It is an honour to be appointed as Chair of Tullow. I look forward to supporting Ian, Richard and the team and engaging with our key stakeholders as we build on Tullow's reputation as a leading operator within the African oil and gas sector. I am confident we have the right team in place, with the skills and competence to implement Tullow's strategy. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to Phuthuma, Genevieve, Martin and Mitch for all their contributions to Tullow, and wish them all the best for the future.\"\n\"With a renewed leadership structure, reset Board and reduced cost base now in place, we are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead of us, including advancing plans to refinance the Company's capital structure and to position Tullow to deliver value for all stakeholders.\"\nCONTACTS\nTullow Investor Relations\nir@tullowoil.com\nMatthew Evans\nCamarco (Media)\n(+44 20 3757 4980)\nBilly Clegg\nGeorgia Edmonds\nRebecca Waterworth\nNotes to editors\nTullow is an independent energy company that is building a better future through responsible oil and gas development in Africa.

The information contained herein has not been audited and may be subject to further review and amendment.\nIan Perks, Chief Executive Officer, Tullow, commented today:\n\"Since joining as CEO in September I have been impressed by the calibre of our team and the quality of our assets. Our near-term priority remains to put Tullow on a long-term sustainable financial footing. To achieve this, we are focused on maximising operational efficiency in Ghana, cost optimisation, and refinancing the Group's capital structure.\n\"In recent months we have successfully completed the sale of our entire working interest in Kenya for at least $120 million and the sale of our assets in Gabon for c.$300 million net of taxes.\n\"There is strong operational momentum across the Company with the acquisition of new 4D seismic data, commencement of an OBN survey and signing of the MoU in Ghana to extend our production licences for both Jubilee and TEN to 2040. We are encouraged by the early successes in the recent Ghana drilling campaign and have spudded the second well in the programme. We continue to face challenges related to the natural decline in our existing well stock and are focused on exploring all options to help mitigate this. Looking ahead into 2026 we will look to optimise production through management of the decline and the additional production from new wells.\"\nOperational update\n\u00b7\n2025 Group production to end-October averaged c.40.7 kboepd, including 7.1 kboepd of gas, taking into account the sale of the Gabonese assets effective from the start of the year.\nGhana\n\u00b7\nJubilee oil production in 2025 has averaged c.61 kbopd (c.23.9 kbopd net) to end-October.\n\u00b7\nJubilee production in 2025 continues to reflect the issues experienced in the first half of the year, but is supported by good performance from the first of the two 2025 Jubilee production wells (J72-P), which was brought onstream in July.\n\u00b7\nDrilling on Jubilee recommenced at the start of November, with the second new production well (J73-P) to come onstream around the end of the year.\n\u00b7\nThe partnership has approved a five well 2026 drill programme, which includes four committed wells (three producers and one water injector) and the addition of one option well (a producer), currently being progressed.\n\u00b7\nInterpretation of the 4D seismic data acquired in the first quarter continues to deliver informative reservoir visualisation insights and is supporting well design optimisation for the current campaign.\nThe Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey is underway and is expected to complete around the end of the year. Integrated processing of both OBN and towed streamer 4D datasets is expected to deliver an improved seismic velocity model in 2026, supporting enhanced subsurface imaging and fluid predictions.\n\u00b7\nTEN oil production in 2025 has averaged c.16 kbopd (c.8.9 kbopd net) to end-October, above expectations through continued strong Ntomme and Enyenra performance.\n\u00b7\nOverall FPSO uptime at Jubilee and TEN has remained high, averaging 97% to end-October.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Ghana, good progress has been made to finalise the agreements required to implement the licence extensions for Jubilee and TEN to the end of 2040, together with payment security for gas and an updated Plan of Development for Jubilee.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, a new Jubilee Gas Sales Agreement is now in place confirming the current gas price to the end of the licences.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\n\u00b7\nEspoir production averaged c.1.2 kboepd net to end-October, slightly below expectations primarily due to gas export outages during the third quarter. Tullow continues to work with the operator to optimise the strategy going forward.\nStrategic and financial update\n\u00b7\nTullow has made substantial progress this year on a number of strategic and financial priorities, including the sales processes in Kenya and Gabon:\n-\nOn 25 September, Tullow successfully completed the sale of its entire working interest in Kenya and received $40 million proceeds. A further $40 million in proceeds are expected on ratification of the Field Development Plan (FDP) approval before the end of the year, which will be followed by a third $40 million in proceeds payable over five years from the third quarter of 2028 onwards.\n-\nOn 29 July, Tullow completed the sale of Tullow Oil Gabon SA for a total cash consideration of $307 million net of tax and customary adjustments.\n\u00b7\nCost base optimisation savings of c.$10 million are well progressed, to reduce 2025 annual net G&A to c.$40 million, with targeted savings of c.$50 million over the next three years compared to 2024.\n\u00b7\nTullow is engaging with bondholders, commodity traders and other private sources of funding with respect to the refinancing of its capital structure. However given the risks associated with business performance, wider market conditions and the upcoming May 2026 bond maturity, Tullow is progressing alternative options with certain of its creditors, including an amend and extend exercise and other forms of liability management transactions.\nGuidance\n\u00b7\n2025 Group production guidance is expected to be at the lower end of the 40-45 kboepd range, as previously guided.\n\u00b7\nCapital expenditure and decommissioning expenditure guidance for 2025 remains c.$185 million and c.$20 million, respectively.\n\u00b7\nFree cash flow guidance for 2025 remains c.$300 million at $65/bbl (realised oil price after hedging to end-Oct c.$68/bbl). This includes recovery of outstanding gas receivables due from the Government of Ghana of c.$100 million which are yet to be received. Total receivables due from the Government of Ghana (including TEN development debt and overdue cash calls) stood at over $200 million (net to Tullow) as at the end of October. Tullow is working closely with the government and its various agencies to resolve this situation.\n\u00b7\nYear-end 2025 net debt guidance is c.$1.2 billion.\n\u00b7\nProduction in 2026 will be dependent on a number of factors, including production from new wells helping to offset the natural decline from existing well stock.\n2026 key guidance metrics\nGroup production\n34-42 kboepd\nOil price assumption\n$65/bbl\nCapital expenditure\nc.$200 million\nDecommissioning\nc.$25 million\nPre-financing cash flow1\nc.$70-100 million\n1\nPre-financing cash flow is defined as underlying operating cash flow plus net cash from/(used) in investing activities, decommissioning expenditure and payments to/from decommissioning escrow fund.\nCONTACTS\nTullow Investor Relations\nir@tullowoil.com\nMatthew Evans\nCamarco (Media)\n(+44 20 3781 9244)\nBilly Clegg\nGeorgia Edmonds\nRebecca Waterworth\nNotes to editors\nTullow is an independent energy company that is building a better future through responsible oil and gas development in Africa.

      "what_they_do": "Tullow Oil is a mid\u2011size oil exploration and production company operating mainly in Africa.",
      "why_they_matter": "It owns a handful of producing fields that could generate cash if the company can unlock value from its asset portfolio.",

      "rns_narrative": [
        "Listing and shareholding updates: Over the last month the company filed a series of regulatory documents that mainly revolve around director shareholding disclosures and a PDMR filing. The 8th December 2025 announcement confirms that a director has increased their stake, while the 28th November 2025 note details a block listing interim review. These filings are routine for an AIM company and do not signal a major market move.",
        "Asset sales and divestments: Tullow has been actively trimming its portfolio. The 25th September 2025 release announced the sale of its Kenyan assets, followed by a July 21st note about a sale to Gulf Energy, and a March 24th announcement that the company had agreed heads of terms for a Gabon asset sale. These moves are aimed at improving cash flow and reducing operational complexity, but they also reduce the company\u2019s long\u2011term production base.",
        "Leadership changes: The company has seen a flurry of executive reshuffles. On 5th September 2025 a new CEO was appointed, and on 1st December 2025 an independent non\u2011executive chair joined the board. These appointments are typical for a turnaround phase, but the lack of a clear strategic narrative keeps investors uncertain.",
        "Financial reporting: The 6th August 2025 half\u2011year results show a modest improvement in cash generation, but the 22nd May 2025 AGM results still reflect a loss. The company also reported on 3rd March 2025 the repayment of 2025 notes, a positive cash flow event, but it was not accompanied by any revenue growth announcement.",
        "Regulatory and compliance notes: Several announcements relate to compliance, such as the 13th May 2025 report on payments to governments and the 6th May 2025 holdings statement. These items are standard corporate disclosures and do not indicate a shift in the business model.",
        "Shareholder activity: The 8th December 2025 director shareholding update and the 28th November 2025 PDMR filing hint at potential insider activity, but the data does not show any significant share sales or purchases that would materially affect the share price.",
        "Overall narrative: The company\u2019s recent communications paint a picture of a firm in the early stages of a divestment\u2011led turnaround. While asset sales and leadership changes are happening, there is no clear revenue engine or new project pipeline announced. The story is largely procedural, and the market has not yet reacted with any enthusiasm."
