In 1994, he joined Trafigura Group as an executive where he had an integral role in the development of the group's oil trading activities, primarily in West Africa. In 2006, he founded his own company, Delaney Petroleum Ltd, trading crude oil and petroleum products predominantly in West Africa and the Middle East. He then returned for a three-year term with Trafigura Group in Geneva and remained an advisor at the company until the end of 2021.\nRoald has served on the Board of Tullow as an independent non-executive Director since February 2023, where he has also been a member of the Audit and Remuneration committees.\nHe is a long-term supporter of Tullow, holding 28,259,396 shares and c.$400,000 2026 Senior Notes.\nRoald is replacing\nPhuthuma Nhleko, who has notified the Board he is stepping down with immediate effect as Chair and non-executive director to focus on other business interests. In addition, Genevieve Sangudi, Martin Greenslade and Mitchell Ingram have also notified the Board they are stepping down with immediate effect as independent non-executive directors of the Board. The Company intends to replace key positions on the Board, whilst retaining a small, focused and aligned Board going forward. Further announcements will be made in due course.\nThe significant reduction in the size of the Board1 will result in a further reduction of Tullow's cost base.\n1\nAs of 1 December 2025 the Board consists of Roald Goethe (Independent Non-Executive Chair of the Board), Rebecca Wiles (Independent Non-Executive Director), Ian Perks (Chief Executive Officer) and Richard Miller (Chief Financial Officer).\nRoald Goethe, Chair of Tullow Oil Plc, said:\n\"It is an honour to be appointed as Chair of Tullow. I look forward to supporting Ian, Richard and the team and engaging with our key stakeholders as we build on Tullow's reputation as a leading operator within the African oil and gas sector. I am confident we have the right team in place, with the skills and competence to implement Tullow's strategy. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to Phuthuma, Genevieve, Martin and Mitch for all their contributions to Tullow, and wish them all the best for the future.\"\n\"With a renewed leadership structure, reset Board and reduced cost base now in place, we are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead of us, including advancing plans to refinance the Company's capital structure and to position Tullow to deliver value for all stakeholders.\"\nCONTACTS\nTullow Investor Relations\nir@tullowoil.com\nMatthew Evans\nCamarco (Media)\n(+44 20 3757 4980)\nBilly Clegg\nGeorgia Edmonds\nRebecca Waterworth\nNotes to editors\nTullow is an independent energy company that is building a better future through responsible oil and gas development in Africa.

The information contained herein has not been audited and may be subject to further review and amendment.\nIan Perks, Chief Executive Officer, Tullow, commented today:\n\"Since joining as CEO in September I have been impressed by the calibre of our team and the quality of our assets. Our near-term priority remains to put Tullow on a long-term sustainable financial footing. To achieve this, we are focused on maximising operational efficiency in Ghana, cost optimisation, and refinancing the Group's capital structure.\n\"In recent months we have successfully completed the sale of our entire working interest in Kenya for at least $120 million and the sale of our assets in Gabon for c.$300 million net of taxes.\n\"There is strong operational momentum across the Company with the acquisition of new 4D seismic data, commencement of an OBN survey and signing of the MoU in Ghana to extend our production licences for both Jubilee and TEN to 2040. We are encouraged by the early successes in the recent Ghana drilling campaign and have spudded the second well in the programme. We continue to face challenges related to the natural decline in our existing well stock and are focused on exploring all options to help mitigate this. Looking ahead into 2026 we will look to optimise production through management of the decline and the additional production from new wells.\"\nOperational update\n\u00b7\n2025 Group production to end-October averaged c.40.7 kboepd, including 7.1 kboepd of gas, taking into account the sale of the Gabonese assets effective from the start of the year.\nGhana\n\u00b7\nJubilee oil production in 2025 has averaged c.61 kbopd (c.23.9 kbopd net) to end-October.\n\u00b7\nJubilee production in 2025 continues to reflect the issues experienced in the first half of the year, but is supported by good performance from the first of the two 2025 Jubilee production wells (J72-P), which was brought onstream in July.\n\u00b7\nDrilling on Jubilee recommenced at the start of November, with the second new production well (J73-P) to come onstream around the end of the year.\n\u00b7\nThe partnership has approved a five well 2026 drill programme, which includes four committed wells (three producers and one water injector) and the addition of one option well (a producer), currently being progressed.\n\u00b7\nInterpretation of the 4D seismic data acquired in the first quarter continues to deliver informative reservoir visualisation insights and is supporting well design optimisation for the current campaign.\nThe Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey is underway and is expected to complete around the end of the year. Integrated processing of both OBN and towed streamer 4D datasets is expected to deliver an improved seismic velocity model in 2026, supporting enhanced subsurface imaging and fluid predictions.\n\u00b7\nTEN oil production in 2025 has averaged c.16 kbopd (c.8.9 kbopd net) to end-October, above expectations through continued strong Ntomme and Enyenra performance.\n\u00b7\nOverall FPSO uptime at Jubilee and TEN has remained high, averaging 97% to end-October.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Ghana, good progress has been made to finalise the agreements required to implement the licence extensions for Jubilee and TEN to the end of 2040, together with payment security for gas and an updated Plan of Development for Jubilee.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, a new Jubilee Gas Sales Agreement is now in place confirming the current gas price to the end of the licences.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\n\u00b7\nEspoir production averaged c.1.2 kboepd net to end-October, slightly below expectations primarily due to gas export outages during the third quarter. Tullow continues to work with the operator to optimise the strategy going forward.\nStrategic and financial update\n\u00b7\nTullow has made substantial progress this year on a number of strategic and financial priorities, including the sales processes in Kenya and Gabon:\n-\nOn 25 September, Tullow successfully completed the sale of its entire working interest in Kenya and received $40 million proceeds. A further $40 million in proceeds are expected on ratification of the Field Development Plan (FDP) approval before the end of the year, which will be followed by a third $40 million in proceeds payable over five years from the third quarter of 2028 onwards.\n-\nOn 29 July, Tullow completed the sale of Tullow Oil Gabon SA for a total cash consideration of $307 million net of tax and customary adjustments.\n\u00b7\nCost base optimisation savings of c.$10 million are well progressed, to reduce 2025 annual net G&A to c.$40 million, with targeted savings of c.$50 million over the next three years compared to 2024.\n\u00b7\nTullow is engaging with bondholders, commodity traders and other private sources of funding with respect to the refinancing of its capital structure. However given the risks associated with business performance, wider market conditions and the upcoming May 2026 bond maturity, Tullow is progressing alternative options with certain of its creditors, including an amend and extend exercise and other forms of liability management transactions.\nGuidance\n\u00b7\n2025 Group production guidance is expected to be at the lower end of the 40-45 kboepd range, as previously guided.\n\u00b7\nCapital expenditure and decommissioning expenditure guidance for 2025 remains c.$185 million and c.$20 million, respectively.\n\u00b7\nFree cash flow guidance for 2025 remains c.$300 million at $65/bbl (realised oil price after hedging to end-Oct c.$68/bbl). This includes recovery of outstanding gas receivables due from the Government of Ghana of c.$100 million which are yet to be received. Total receivables due from the Government of Ghana (including TEN development debt and overdue cash calls) stood at over $200 million (net to Tullow) as at the end of October. Tullow is working closely with the government and its various agencies to resolve this situation.\n\u00b7\nYear-end 2025 net debt guidance is c.$1.2 billion.\n\u00b7\nProduction in 2026 will be dependent on a number of factors, including production from new wells helping to offset the natural decline from existing well stock.\n2026 key guidance metrics\nGroup production\n34-42 kboepd\nOil price assumption\n$65/bbl\nCapital expenditure\nc.$200 million\nDecommissioning\nc.$25 million\nPre-financing cash flow1\nc.$70-100 million\n1\nPre-financing cash flow is defined as underlying operating cash flow plus net cash from/(used) in investing activities, decommissioning expenditure and payments to/from decommissioning escrow fund.\nCONTACTS\nTullow Investor Relations\nir@tullowoil.com\nMatthew Evans\nCamarco (Media)\n(+44 20 3781 9244)\nBilly Clegg\nGeorgia Edmonds\nRebecca Waterworth\nNotes to editors\nTullow is an independent energy company that is building a better future through responsible oil and gas development in Africa.

In 1994, he joined Trafigura Group as an executive where he had an integral role in the development of the group's oil trading activities, primarily in West Africa. In 2006, he founded his own company, Delaney Petroleum Ltd, trading crude oil and petroleum products predominantly in West Africa and the Middle East. He then returned for a three-year term with Trafigura Group in Geneva and remained an advisor at the company until the end of 2021.\nRoald has served on the Board of Tullow as an independent non-executive Director since February 2023, where he has also been a member of the Audit and Remuneration committees.\nHe is a long-term supporter of Tullow, holding 28,259,396 shares and c.$400,000 2026 Senior Notes.\nRoald is replacing\nPhuthuma Nhleko, who has notified the Board he is stepping down with immediate effect as Chair and non-executive director to focus on other business interests. In addition, Genevieve Sangudi, Martin Greenslade and Mitchell Ingram have also notified the Board they are stepping down with immediate effect as independent non-executive directors of the Board. The Company intends to replace key positions on the Board, whilst retaining a small, focused and aligned Board going forward. Further announcements will be made in due course.\nThe significant reduction in the size of the Board1 will result in a further reduction of Tullow's cost base.\n1\nAs of 1 December 2025 the Board consists of Roald Goethe (Independent Non-Executive Chair of the Board), Rebecca Wiles (Independent Non-Executive Director), Ian Perks (Chief Executive Officer) and Richard Miller (Chief Financial Officer).\nRoald Goethe, Chair of Tullow Oil Plc, said:\n\"It is an honour to be appointed as Chair of Tullow. I look forward to supporting Ian, Richard and the team and engaging with our key stakeholders as we build on Tullow's reputation as a leading operator within the African oil and gas sector.

The information contained herein has not been audited and may be subject to further review and amendment.\nIan Perks, Chief Executive Officer, Tullow, commented today:\n\"Since joining as CEO in September I have been impressed by the calibre of our team and the quality of our assets. Our near-term priority remains to put Tullow on a long-term sustainable financial footing. To achieve this, we are focused on maximising operational efficiency in Ghana, cost optimisation, and refinancing the Group's capital structure.\n\"In recent months we have successfully completed the sale of our entire working interest in Kenya for at least $120 million and the sale of our assets in Gabon for c.$300 million net of taxes.\n\"There is strong operational momentum across the Company with the acquisition of new 4D seismic data, commencement of an OBN survey and signing of the MoU in Ghana to extend our production licences for both Jubilee and TEN to 2040. We are encouraged by the early successes in the recent Ghana drilling campaign and have spudded the second well in the programme. We continue to face challenges related to the natural decline in our existing well stock and are focused on exploring all options to help mitigate this. Looking ahead into 2026 we will look to optimise production through management of the decline and the additional production from new wells.\"\nOperational update\n\u00b7\n2025 Group production to end-October averaged c.40.7 kboepd, including 7.1 kboepd of gas, taking into account the sale of the Gabonese assets effective from the start of the year.\nGhana\n\u00b7\nJubilee oil production in 2025 has averaged c.61 kbopd (c.23.9 kbopd net) to end-October.\n\u00b7\nJubilee production in 2025 continues to reflect the issues experienced in the first half of the year, but is supported by good performance from the first of the two 2025 Jubilee production wells (J72-P), which was brought onstream in July.\n\u00b7\nDrilling on Jubilee recommenced at the start of November, with the second new production well (J73-P) to come onstream around the end of the year.\n\u00b7\nThe partnership has approved a five well 2026 drill programme, which includes four committed wells (three producers and one water injector) and the addition of one option well (a producer), currently being progressed.\n\u00b7\nInterpretation of the 4D seismic data acquired in the first quarter continues to deliver informative reservoir visualisation insights and is supporting well design optimisation for the current campaign.\nThe Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey is underway and is expected to complete around the end of the year. Integrated processing of both OBN and towed streamer 4D datasets is expected to deliver an improved seismic velocity model in 2026, supporting enhanced subsurface imaging and fluid predictions.\n\u00b7\nTEN oil production in 2025 has averaged c.16 kbopd (c.8.9 kbopd net) to end-October, above expectations through continued strong Ntomme and Enyenra performance.\n\u00b7\nOverall FPSO uptime at Jubilee and TEN has remained high, averaging 97% to end-October.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Ghana, good progress has been made to finalise the agreements required to implement the licence extensions for Jubilee and TEN to the end of 2040, together with payment security for gas and an updated Plan of Development for Jubilee.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, a new Jubilee Gas Sales Agreement is now in place confirming the current gas price to the end of the licences.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\n\u00b7\nEspoir production averaged c.1.2 kboepd net to end-October, slightly below expectations primarily due to gas export outages during the third quarter. Tullow continues to work with the operator to optimise the strategy going forward.\nStrategic and financial update\n\u00b7\nTullow has made substantial progress this year on a number of strategic and financial priorities, including the sales processes in Kenya and Gabon:\n-\nOn 25 September, Tullow successfully completed the sale of its entire working interest in Kenya and received $40 million proceeds. A further $40 million in proceeds are expected on ratification of the Field Development Plan (FDP) approval before the end of the year, which will be followed by a third $40 million in proceeds payable over five years from the third quarter of 2028 onwards.\n-\nOn 29 July, Tullow completed the sale of Tullow Oil Gabon SA for a total cash consideration of $307 million net of tax and customary adjustments.\n\u00b7\nCost base optimisation savings of c.$10 million are well progressed, to reduce 2025 annual net G&A to c.$40 million, with targeted savings of c.$50 million over the next three years compared to 2024.\n\u00b7\nTullow is engaging with bondholders, commodity traders and other private sources of funding with respect to the refinancing of its capital structure.

Reserves estimates for Ghana have been extracted from a reserves report (dated 26 September 2025) prepared by the appointed external auditor, TRACS International Limited, based on data available to the end of June 2025. Reserves estimates for C\u2122te d'Ivoire are based on the Reserves Report prepared by TRACS as of 31 December 2024, adjusted for 1H 2025 production.\nTotal reserves of 113.8 mmboe as of 30 June 2025 compare with total reserves of 128.5 mmboe as of 31 December 2024, both excluding Gabon. The reduction reflects 7.4 mmboe of production and revisions associated with production performance during 1H 2025 of 7.3 mmboe (Jubilee 6.3 mmboe and TEN 1.0 mmboe).\nFollowing the Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ghana to extend the production licences to 2040, TRACS has estimated that 14.7 mmboe of Jubilee Contingent Resources and 3.5 mmboe of TEN Contingent Resources would move to 2P Reserves once the extensions are executed.\nWith the new 4D seismic data acquired in 1Q 2025 and an Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) survey planned for 4Q 2025, Tullow expects to mature new projects and increase 2P reserves in Ghana. This is further supported by ongoing work with the Government of Ghana in relation to a Plan of Further Development for Jubilee, which covers the licence extensions and further drilling opportunities.\nThe report is available on the website here:\nhttps://www.tullowoil.com/investors/results-reports-and-presentations/\nCONTACTS\nTullow Investor Relations\nir@tullowoil.com\nMatthew Evans\nCamarco (Media)\n(+44 20 3757 4980)\nBilly Clegg\nGeorgia Edmonds\nRebecca Waterworth\nNotes to editors\nTullow is an independent energy company that is building a better future through responsible oil and gas development in Africa.

We have recommenced drilling and have successfully completed and brought onstream the first of two planned 2025 production wells at Jubilee, with better than expected net pay during drilling. The high quality 4D seismic data acquired at the start of the year is now being used to generate improved models that will directly inform the well-planning process and will be further supported with the capture of an Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey in the fourth quarter this year.\n\"We achieved a key milestone by signing a MoU in Ghana to extend our production licences for both Jubilee and TEN to 2040, which is expected to increase reserves and unlock significant value from these fields.\n\"In the second half of the year we are focussed on refinancing our capital structure, production optimisation activities and continuing to optimise our cost base, which combined with the progress in the first half of the year will help unlock Tullow's intrinsic value.\"\n2025 FIRST HALF RESULTS\n\u00b7\nFirst half Group working interest oil and gas production 50.0 kboepd (1H24: 63.7 kboepd).

Completion and receipt of the first two milestone payments, totalling $80 million, are expected during 2025.\n-\nOn 4 June, Tullow and its JV partners announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Ghana to extend the West Cape Three Points (WCTP) and Deep Water Tano (DWT) licences to 2040; the MoU includes a commitment to work to increase gas supply to c.130 mmscf/d and a guaranteed reimbursement mechanism for gas sales. As a result of the licence extensions the JV partners expect to realise a material increase in gross 2P reserves.\n-\nIn January the International Chamber of Commerce Tribunal determined that Branch Profit Remittance Tax (BPRT) in Ghana is not appliable to Tullow Ghana and therefore it is not liable to pay the $320 million assessment.\n2025 FULL YEAR OUTLOOK\n\u00b7\n2025 Group working interest production guidance is expected to average 40-45 kboepd, including c.6 kboepd of gas, reflecting the sale of the Gabonese assets effective from the start of the year.\n\u00b7\nFull year capex and ",

This right can be exercised if a third party investor participates in future development phases whether through a sale or farm-down of the Purchaser's interest in the assets.\nTransaction highlights\n\u00b7\nCorporate sale of Tullow's entire Kenyan portfolio of assets, representing c.463 million barrels of 2C resources.\n\u00b7\nMinimum cash consideration of US$120 million, with additional royalty payments subject to certain conditions.\n\u00b7\nTullow retains a back-in right for a 30% participation in potential future development phases at no historic cost.\nThis right can be exercised if a third party investor participates in future development phases, whether through a sale or farm-down of the Purchaser's interest in the assets.\n\u00b7\nAll past and future decommissioning liabilities and all material past and future environmental liabilities will be transferred to the Purchaser as part of the Transaction, details of which are noted in paragraph 2 of Part C of Appendix III.\n\u00b7\nThe conditions precedent to be met in advance of completion of the Transaction include (i) approval of the Transaction by the Competition Authority of Kenya, and (ii) the Seller and the Purchaser agreeing and implementing a plan to achieve a physical and functional separation of Tullow Kenya from the Tullow group.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of the Transaction, satisfaction of conditions precedent and receipt of funds from Tranche A and FDP approval (and consequent receipt of funds from Tranche B) are expected in 2025.\nRichard Miller, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer, Tullow, commented:\n\"We are pleased to announce the signing of the Kenyan SPA, marking another step closer to completion of the Transaction with Gulf Energy. For a total consideration of at least US$120 million, the Transaction supports our strategic priority to strengthen the balance sheet, with the first two payments totalling US$80 million expected before the end of the year.\nFurthermore, we are pleased to retain a potentially material zero cost value option to participate in future development phases.\nWe continue to advance plans to optimise our capital structure during 2025. Coupled with the sale of our Gabonese assets, the disposal of these non-core assets is expected to provide cash proceeds of US$380 million in 2025.\n\"\nConsideration structure\n\u00b7\nMinimum consideration of\u00a0US$120 million, consisting of:\no\nTranche A\n:\u00a0US$40 million\u00a0payable on Transaction completion.\no\nTranche B\n:\u00a0US$40 million\u00a0payable at the earlier of FDP approval or\u00a030 June 2026.\no\nTranche C\n:\u00a0US$40 million\u00a0payable no later than\u00a030 June 2033, subject to the following payment schedule:\n\u00a7\nPayments of\u00a0US$2 million\u00a0per quarter starting in the third quarter of 2028, provided Dated Brent oil price averaged at least\u00a0US$65/bbl during the preceding quarter.\n\u00a7\nIf\u00a0US$40 million\u00a0in aggregate has not been paid by\u00a030 June 2033, the remainder will be due as a bullet payment at that point irrespective of the prevailing oil price.\n\u00b7\nRoyalty Payment\n:\u00a0In addition to the above, the Seller will receive quarterly royalty payments of\u00a0US$0.5/bbl multiplied by 80% of total production, subject to oil price, resource and production related conditions to the extent that the Purchaser retains its interest in the Disposed Assets.\nRationale for and expected benefits of the Transaction\n\u00b7\nValue accretive transaction that significantly reduces leverage, further strengthening Tullow's balance sheet following the disposal of interests in Gabon for US$300 million, where the SPA was signed on 13 May 2025 (\nLINK\n).\n\u00b7\nThe Transaction is in line with Tullow's strategy of focusing on high-margin, self-funded production with strong ca",

As a result of the extension the JV partnership expects to realise a material increase in gross 2P reserves.\nA number of principles are covered within the MOU that will help underpin the continued development of the Jubilee and TEN fields, including:\n\u00b7\nA commitment to work to increase in the supply of gas from the Jubilee and TEN fields to c.130 mmscf/d\n\u00b7\nA reduced gas price for Jubilee associated gas\n\u00b7\nA guaranteed reimbursement mechanism for gas sales\n\u00b7\nInvestment in Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the Petroleum Commission's capacity with a focus on the use of advanced technology\nAll terms and conditions of the existing WCTP and DWT Petroleum Agreements remain in place and continue unchanged.\nThe next steps, following this MOU, are the submission for approval of a Jubilee Plan of Development (PoD) Addendum, entering into new fully termed gas sales agreements (GSA), and the submission for parliamentary approval of the payment security mechanism and licence extensions planned before the end of the third quarter of 2025.\nHon. John Abdulai Jinapor, Ghana's Minister for Energy and Green Transition, commented:\n\"This Memorandum of Understanding between the Republic of Ghana and the DWT and WCTP partners marks a significant step forward in our nation's energy sector. Extending the licenses to 2040 demonstrates our commitment to fostering a stable and attractive investment climate. This MOU will not only ensure the continued production of oil, supporting our economic growth, but also allow us to further develop our infrastructure and create more job opportunities for our citizens. We are dedicated to responsible resource management and look forward to a prosperous future fuelled by sustainable energy practices.\"\nRichard Miller, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Tullow, commented:\n\"This is a valuable step forward for the Government of Ghana, Tullow and our JV partners, highlighting the collaborative and constructive relationship we all have in reaching our shared goal of building a better future for the people of Ghana, through responsible oil and gas development. This extension and the fiscal stability of our contracts emphasizes the opportunity Ghana represents to deliver additional value through production and reserves additions, providing greater long-term optionality and materiality to these core assets.\"\nAndy G. Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kosmos, commented:\n\"This memorandum of understanding recognizes the importance of oil and gas in Ghana and the desire of the new administration to create an attractive environment for new investment in the sector. Extending the Ghana production licenses is highly accretive, adding material reserves and enabling the partnership to continue investing in the country for the long-term. This investment is expected to maximize the value of the fields for the benefit of the country's economic development and Kosmos' shareholders.

The meeting will take place at Tullow Oil plc, Building 9, Chiswick Park, London, W4 5XT at 11:00 BST today. We are also enabling shareholders to listen to the AGM as well as participate remotely. Instructions for joining the audio cast can be found at the end of this statement or within the\nNotice of Meeting\n.\nThe information contained herein has not been audited and may be subject to further review and amendment.\nRichard Miller, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Tullow, commented:\n\"The strengthening of our balance sheet continues to be the key priority for the team and there is renewed energy within the business following a number of recent key milestones achieved, despite the challenging oil price environment. Our strategy to divest certain non-core assets to accelerate our deleveraging trajectory is progressing well, with the sale of Gabon and Kenya expected to provide near term cash proceeds of $380 million.\n\"We continue to advance our plans to refinance our capital structure during 2025 which, coupled with our cost optimisation programme to realise c.$10 million annual cash net G&A savings and a continued disciplined approach to capital allocation, will lay a solid foundation for future value creation.\"\nOperational update\n\u00b7\nGroup working interest production in the first quarter of 2025 was 52.9 kboepd, including 7.1 kboepd of gas production, within the expected range for the period and affected by a two-week planned maintenance shutdown conducted safely and on budget on the Jubilee field.\n\u00b7\n2025 Group working interest production guidance, prior to Gabon transaction completion, remains 50 to 55 kboepd, including c.6 kboepd of gas.\n\u00b7\nNext Ghana drilling campaign has commenced with the first well, a Jubilee producer, expected onstream in the third quarter of 2025.\n\u00b7\nAnalysis of the 4D seismic survey, which was completed in first quarter of 2025, is underway and will support future well locations to drive reserves growth.\nFinancial update\n\u00b7\nStrong progress made on accelerating our deleveraging process through non-core asset disposals:\no\nSale and purchase agreement (SPA) signed for the sale of Tullow's entire Gabonese portfolio of assets for a total cash consideration of $300 million net of tax. Approval by the Gabonese Ministry of Hydrocarbons has already been received and subject to the remaining conditions precedent, completion of the transaction and receipt of funds is expected around the middle of the year.\no\nHeads of terms signed for the sale of Tullow's entire working interests in Kenya, for a minimum cash consideration of $120 million, with additional royalty payments subject to certain conditions and an option to back-in for 30% of potential future development phases at no cost; on track to sign SPA in the near-term. Completion and receipt of first two payments totalling $80 million are expected during 2025.\n\u00b7\nNet debt at 31 March was $1.6 billion, an increase from year end due to the timing of liftings.\n\u00b7\nHedge portfolio protects c.60% of forecast 2025 sales volumes at weighted average price of $59/bbl, increasing to c.70% on completion of Gabon portfolio sale.\n\u00b7\nOptimisation of cost base continues, with expected c.$10 million savings identified, reducing annual cash net G&A to c.$40 million, before additional material savings expected as a result of Gabon and Kenya transactions.\n\u00b7\nFull year free cash flow guidance is now $400 million at $65/bbl, inclusive of both $380 million of disposal proceeds and c.$50 million of overdue gas payments in Ghana from 2024, resulting in expected year-end net debt of c.$1.1 billion.\n\u00b7\nTullow has extended its Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) to the end of October 2025, with all lenders participating in the extension, demonstrating their ongoing support. The RCF, which is currently drawn to manage near-term working capital, has been reduced to $150 million, in line with working capital requirements in a low oil price environment. The facility will be repaid and cancelled in full on completion of the Gabon disposal when it will no longer be required for liquidity management.\nGovernance update\n\u00b7\nThe process to find a new CEO is progressing and an update will be provided in due course.\nAGM audio cast\n11:00am BST\nWe are enabling shareholders to listen to a live audio cast of the AGM, as well as participate remotely.\nIn order to participate at the meeting, you will need to visit\nwww.meetnow.global/TULLAGM2025\non your device operating a compatible browser using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari.

(\nTOGSA\n), which holds all of Tullow's non-operated working interests in Gabon (the \"\nDisposed Assets\n\") for a total cash consideration of US$300 million net of tax (the \"\nTransaction\n\"), subject to customary adjustments.\nTransaction highlights\n\u00b7\nCorporate sale of Tullow's entire Gabonese portfolio of assets, representing c.10 kbopd of 2025 production guidance and c.36 million barrels of 2P reserves (independently audited at year-end 2024).\n\u00b7\nThe total cash consideration of US$300 million net of tax\n(subject to customary adjustments)\ndue on Completion.\n\u00b7\nThe conditions precedent to be met in advance of Completion of the Transaction include all necessary government and regulatory approvals.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of the Transaction, satisfaction of conditions precedent and receipt of funds is expected around the middle of the year.\nRichard Miller, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer, Tullow, commented:\n\"We continue to make strong progress towards completing this strategic, value accretive divestment of our Gabon assets, with the signing of the SPA. The proceeds, expected in the coming months, will materially reduce our net debt and strengthen our balance sheet, which positions us well as we look to optimise our capital structure.\"\n\"Looking ahead, the Transaction enables Tullow to continue to deliver against our business objectives to unlock value from our high-margin, self-funded assets to grow our reserve base and create value for all stakeholders.\"\nRationale for and expected benefits of the Transaction\n\u00b7\nValue accretive transaction that significantly reduces leverage, further strengthens Tullow's balance sheet and is in line with Tullow's strategy of focusing on high-margin, self-funded production with strong cash flows.\n\u00b7\nPositions the Group well to optimise its capital structure in 2025 and accelerate deleveraging.\n\u00b7\nRevised portfolio of assets will enable Tullow to leverage its technical skills and focus on more material positions in key fields to grow its reserve base.\n\u00b7\nProvides strong foundations for organic growth within the core portfolio and inorganic growth opportunities, with a focus on deepwater operated positions in West Africa.\nUse of proceeds\nNet proceeds from the Transaction will be used to strengthen Tullow's balance sheet by materially reducing Tullow's net debt and is therefore expected to reduce the risk associated with a holistic debt refinancing expected in 2025.\nInformation on the Disposed Assets\n\u00b7\nThe Disposed Assets comprise all of Tullow's non-operated working interests in Gabon.\n\u00b7\nThe total asset value subject to the Transaction is c.US$256 million (excluding outstanding intercompany balances) as at 31 December 2024 and the gross profit attributable to the Disposed Assets was c.US$119\nmillion for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n\u00b7\nThe Disposed Assets produced 9.6 kbopd in 2024 and had 36 million barrels of 2P reserves as of 31 December 2024.\n\u00b7\nFurther information about the Disposed Assets is set out in Appendix I to this announcement and historical financial\ninformation relating to the Disposed Assets is set out in Appendix II to this announcement.\nEffect of the Transaction on the Continuing Group\nFinancial impacts of the Transaction on Tullow are currently expected to be (based on financials as at 31 December 2024) as follows:\n\u00b7\nReduction in pro forma gross profit of c.US$119 million.\n\u00b7\nReduction in pro forma operating profit before tax of c.US$120 million (excluding the impact of one-off gains recognised on disposal of assets in 2024).\n\u00b7\nReduction in pro forma total assets of c.US$256 million excluding outstanding intercompany balances at 31 December 2024.\n\u00b7\nReduction in pro forma total liabilities of c.US$108 million excluding current tax liabilities at 31 December 2024, of which c.US$31 million was provision for decommissioning.\n\u00b7\nThe net amount of the proceeds will be recognised in the Group's consolidated financial statements after Completion, including any associated financial impacts of the Transaction.\nFollowing Completion, the Group will no longer receive the contribution that the Disposed Assets currently make to the Group's financial results. In the Group's forthcoming interim consolidated financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Disposed Assets will be presented as a disposal group held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5\nif Completion takes place by 30 June 2025\n.

Our improved balance sheet, alongside the extension of our revolving credit facility, positions us well as we look to manage our debt maturities and optimise the Group's capital structure in 2025. Following the successful resolution of the Ghana Branch Profits Remittance Tax arbitration and a return to drilling at Jubilee, combined with production optimisation activities to reduce decline rates and further cost reductions, 2025 is set to be an exciting year for Tullow as we lay the foundations for capital returns and pan-African growth.\"\n2024 Performance - Continued strong progress against business objectives\nOperational\n\u00b7\nFull year working interest production averaged c.61.2 kboepd in 2024, including c.6.6 kboepd of gas.\n\u00b7\nProduction from Jubilee was 33.9 kbopd net (gross 87.0 kbopd), and TEN was 10.2 kbopd net (gross 18.5 kbopd).\n\u00b7\nProduction from the non-operated portfolio in Gabon and C\n\u00f4\nte d'Ivoire was 10.6 kbopd net.\n\u00b7\nFive new Jubilee wells (three producers and two water injectors) were brought onstream in 2024, bringing that drill programme to an end, approximately six months ahead of schedule and with no recordable safety incidents.\n\u00b7\nOverall FPSO uptime at Jubilee and TEN averaged 97% in 2024.\n\u00b7\nDecommissioning activities in Mauritania were accelerated and completed in 2024, ahead of schedule and below budget.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenue of c.$1.5 billion (including c.$74 million hedge costs) at an average realised oil price (pre-hedging) of $80.2/bbl.\n\u00b7\nCapital and decommissioning expenditure of c.$230 million and c.$60 million respectively, in line with guidance.\n\u00b7\nUnderlying operating cash flow1 of c.$652 million and free cash flow of c.$156 million.\n\u00b7\nNet debt reduced to c.$1.45 billion and gearing of c.1.3 times.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful extension of the $250 million revolving credit facility to the end of June 2025.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful resolution of the Ghana Branch Profits Remittance Tax arbitration, which removes $320 million contingent liability, and endorses the sanctity of our Petroleum Agreements.\nReserves and resources\n\u00b7\nIndependently audited 2P reserves at year end 2024 of 164.5 mmboe (212 mmboe at year end 2023), valued at c.$2.5 billion (NPV10).\n\u00b7\nReserves reduction includes 22.4 mmboe of Group production in 2024 and a revision on Jubilee, where the estimated quantum of oil-in-place remains unchanged.\n\u00b7\nUpwards revision of TEN reserves, supported by substantial progress towards a material reduction in fixed costs, including in relation to the FPSO.\n\u00b7\nIn 2025, part of the Group's material 2C resources are expected to mature into 2P reserves with the support of the ongoing 4D seismic survey in Ghana and resulting identification of robust infill targets.\n\u00b7\nThe magnitude of the Group's estimated 2C resources (c.700 mmboe) reflects the material opportunity Tullow has ahead, to mature resources into reserves and sustain long-term production.\n2025 Outlook - Cost efficiency and production optimisation driving continued cash generation\nOperational\n\u00b7\nGroup working interest production expected to average between 50 to 55 kboepd, including c.6 kboepd of gas and inclusive of a two-week maintenance shutdown planned on the Jubilee field in the first half of the year, with a c.4% impact on Jubilee annual production.\n\u00b7\nWater injection capacity on Jubilee was increased to 300 kbwpd late in 2024.

The Tribunal determined that BPRT is not applicable to Tullow Ghana since it falls outside of the tax regime provided for in the Petroleum Agreements.\nAs a result of the Tribunal's award, Tullow Ghana is not liable to pay the $320 million BPRT assessment issued by the Ghana Revenue Authority and will have no future exposure to BPRT in respect of its operations under the Petroleum Agreements. Tullow continues to engage with the Government of Ghana on\ntwo further disputed tax claims\n, which were referred to the ICC in February 2023, with the aim of resolving these disputes on a mutually acceptable basis.\nTullow Chief Executive Officer, Rahul Dhir, commented today:\n\"We are delighted with the outcome and decision of the Tribunal, which affirms our assessment and removes a material overhang from our business. We have continuously had confidence in the sanctity of our Petroleum Agreements and the dispute resolution process, which has now brought certainty to all parties. I look forward to constructive discussions with the Government of Ghana to resolve the remaining claims so that our collective focus remains on maximising value from the Jubilee and TEN fields\".\n------ENDS------\nCONTACTS\nTullow Investor Relations\nir@tullowoil.com\nMatthew Evans\nCamarco (Media)\n(+44 20 3757 4980)\nBilly Clegg\nGeorgia Edmonds\nRebecca Waterworth\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation 2014/596/EU which is part of domestic UK law pursuant to the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310) (\"UK MAR\").

Accordingly, these agreements will be extended to 2040, and starting from July 2036, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (GNPC) share in the fields will increase by a further 10% interest and the joint venture partners shares will decrease pro rata. As part of the extension of the Petroleum Agreements, the Jubilee plan of development has been amended to include up to 20 additional wells in the field. As a result of the extension Kosmos expects to realize an increase in 2P reserves. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kosmos-energy-provides-operational-financial-070000517.html",

So if they can produce at just under 70k that would imply the GOR should go down a little bit as previous GOR precluded more than 67.5K. if that's the case (which it probably is) then that seems more promising than before. Will need confirmation from the 3rd well. Regarding the 3 levels. Jubilee has various lobes (sand bodies) at different levels. It's a bit like 3 or 4 laurel leaves overlying each other with slightly different orientations. In some places multiple leaves line up and can be penetrated by one well. The two main producing lobes (the laurel leaves) are something like MH1 and MH5 from memory and one/both each has upper and lower producing horizons within one lobe - so there are at least 3 or even 4 existing producing horizons.

Enhanced Liquidity: A merged Rio-Glencore entity would be the world's largest mining group with a market value exceeding $200 billion. This massive scale could provide Tullow with a more financially robust and stable partner during its critical 2026 refinancing period. Reduced Default Risk: Analysts previously noted that Glencore's backing \"significantly de-risks\" Tullow's ability to handle its debt. A more liquid, merged parent company could potentially offer even more favorable credit terms or extensions to ensure Tullow's operational continuity.",

Even just an \"agreed roadmap\" for settlement of outstanding payments and and agreed price for future production would be quite helpful for negotiating decent terms of refinancing. Ghana clears $1.47 billion in energy debts, finance ministry says 12/01/2026 11:31 - RSF By Emmanuel Bruce ACCRA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ghana's government paid $1.47 billion in 2025 to clear legacy energy sector debts, restoring a depleted World Bank guarantee and settling arrears with power producers, the West African nation's finance ministry said on Monday. ------------ Ghana's power sector has been grappling with widespread unpaid debts that have led to a sharp increase in outages. Last year, President John Dramani Mahama promised to reduce the $2.5 billion owed to independent power producers and gas suppliers. \"The era of uncontrolled energy sector debt accumulation is over,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that disciplined financial management had enabled the payments while securing provisions for timely future obligations. The ministry said the government had repaid over $597 million to the World Bank, fully restoring the partial risk guarantee for gas supplies from the Offshore Cape Three Points field. The guarantee, established in 2015, was designed to protect nearly $8 billion in private investment in the energy sector. Its depletion had damaged the government's credibility with international partners. An additional $480 million was paid to Italian energy company ENI (ENI.MI) and commodities trader Vitol for outstanding gas invoices related to electricity generation through the Sankofa Gas Project, the ministry said. The government also settled approximately $393 million in legacy debts owed to independent power producers, including $120 million to Turkey's Karpowership and $59.4 million to Cenpower Generation, according to a breakdown provided by the ministry. Independent power producers said in a separate statement that the clearance of long-outstanding obligations represents a major milestone in restoring financial stability and operational confidence across the power sector. The government has also renegotiated all agreements with independent power producers and is working with Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Jubilee Field partners on a payment roadmap, the ministry said. Ghana is seeking to boost domestic gas production and reduce its reliance on expensive liquid fuels.",

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

The host nation ultimately owns the oil and the contractor is granted a license to produce the stuff with the revenue being shared between both parties. But to your point. What happened about 50 yrs ago was that Venezuela ripped up the existing PSC's, unilaterally nationalising the foreign operations of US big oil like Exxon and Mobil in Venezuela  and still haven't paid the major part of the compensation awarded by international tribunals. Whether or not USA is now acting legally, or not is another matter.....",

The agreements have now been submitted to parliament for formal ratification. Accordingly, these agreements will be extended to 2040, and starting from July 2036, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (GNPC) share in the fields will increase by a further 10% interest and the joint venture partners shares will decrease pro rata. As part of the extension of the Petroleum Agreements, the Jubilee plan of development has been amended to include up to 20 additional wells in the field. As a result of the extension Kosmos expects to realize an increase in 2P reserves. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kosmos-energy-provides-operational-financial-070000517.html",

So if they can produce at just under 70k that would imply the GOR should go down a little bit as previous GOR precluded more than 67.5K. if that's the case (which it probably is) then that seems more promising than before. Will need confirmation from the 3rd well. Regarding the 3 levels. Jubilee has various lobes (sand bodies) at different levels. It's a bit like 3 or 4 laurel leaves overlying each other with slightly different orientations. In some places multiple leaves line up and can be penetrated by one well. The two main producing lobes (the laurel leaves) are something like MH1 and MH5 from memory and one/both each has upper and lower producing horizons within one lobe - so there are at least 3 or even 4 existing producing horizons.

Enhanced Liquidity: A merged Rio-Glencore entity would be the world's largest mining group with a market value exceeding $200 billion. This massive scale could provide Tullow with a more financially robust and stable partner during its critical 2026 refinancing period. Reduced Default Risk: Analysts previously noted that Glencore's backing \"significantly de-risks\" Tullow's ability to handle its debt. A more liquid, merged parent company could potentially offer even more favorable credit terms or extensions to ensure Tullow's operational continuity.",

Ghana clears $1.47 billion in energy debts, finance ministry says 12/01/2026 11:31 - RSF By Emmanuel Bruce ACCRA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ghana's government paid $1.47 billion in 2025 to clear legacy energy sector debts, restoring a depleted World Bank guarantee and settling arrears with power producers, the West African nation's finance ministry said on Monday. ------------ Ghana's power sector has been grappling with widespread unpaid debts that have led to a sharp increase in outages. Last year, President John Dramani Mahama promised to reduce the $2.5 billion owed to independent power producers and gas suppliers. \"The era of uncontrolled energy sector debt accumulation is over,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that disciplined financial management had enabled the payments while securing provisions for timely future obligations. The ministry said the government had repaid over $597 million to the World Bank, fully restoring the partial risk guarantee for gas supplies from the Offshore Cape Three Points field. The guarantee, established in 2015, was designed to protect nearly $8 billion in private investment in the energy sector. Its depletion had damaged the government's credibility with international partners. An additional $480 million was paid to Italian energy company ENI (ENI.MI) and commodities trader Vitol for outstanding gas invoices related to electricity generation through the Sankofa Gas Project, the ministry said. The government also settled approximately $393 million in legacy debts owed to independent power producers, including $120 million to Turkey's Karpowership and $59.4 million to Cenpower Generation, according to a breakdown provided by the ministry. Independent power producers said in a separate statement that the clearance of long-outstanding obligations represents a major milestone in restoring financial stability and operational confidence across the power sector. The government has also renegotiated all agreements with independent power producers and is working with Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Jubilee Field partners on a payment roadmap, the ministry said. Ghana is seeking to boost domestic gas production and reduce its reliance on expensive liquid fuels.",

Accordingly, these agreements will be extended to 2040, and starting from July 2036, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (GNPC) share in the fields will increase by a further 10% interest and the joint venture partners shares will decrease pro rata. As part of the extension of the Petroleum Agreements, the Jubilee plan of development has been amended to include up to 20 additional wells in the field. As a result of the extension Kosmos expects to realize an increase in 2P reserves. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kosmos-energy-provides-operational-financial-070000517.html",

So if they can produce at just under 70k that would imply the GOR should go down a little bit as previous GOR precluded more than 67.5K. if that's the case (which it probably is) then that seems more promising than before. Will need confirmation from the 3rd well. Regarding the 3 levels. Jubilee has various lobes (sand bodies) at different levels. It's a bit like 3 or 4 laurel leaves overlying each other with slightly different orientations. In some places multiple leaves line up and can be penetrated by one well. The two main producing lobes (the laurel leaves) are something like MH1 and MH5 from memory and one/both each has upper and lower producing horizons within one lobe - so there are at least 3 or even 4 existing producing horizons.

Enhanced Liquidity: A merged Rio-Glencore entity would be the world's largest mining group with a market value exceeding $200 billion. This massive scale could provide Tullow with a more financially robust and stable partner during its critical 2026 refinancing period. Reduced Default Risk: Analysts previously noted that Glencore's backing \"significantly de-risks\" Tullow's ability to handle its debt. A more liquid, merged parent company could potentially offer even more favorable credit terms or extensions to ensure Tullow's operational continuity.",

Even just an \"agreed roadmap\" for settlement of outstanding payments and and agreed price for future production would be quite helpful for negotiating decent terms of refinancing. Ghana clears $1.47 billion in energy debts, finance ministry says 12/01/2026 11:31 - RSF By Emmanuel Bruce ACCRA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ghana's government paid $1.47 billion in 2025 to clear legacy energy sector debts, restoring a depleted World Bank guarantee and settling arrears with power producers, the West African nation's finance ministry said on Monday. ------------ Ghana's power sector has been grappling with widespread unpaid debts that have led to a sharp increase in outages. Last year, President John Dramani Mahama promised to reduce the $2.5 billion owed to independent power producers and gas suppliers. \"The era of uncontrolled energy sector debt accumulation is over,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that disciplined financial management had enabled the payments while securing provisions for timely future obligations. The ministry said the government had repaid over $597 million to the World Bank, fully restoring the partial risk guarantee for gas supplies from the Offshore Cape Three Points field. The guarantee, established in 2015, was designed to protect nearly $8 billion in private investment in the energy sector. Its depletion had damaged the government's credibility with international partners. An additional $480 million was paid to Italian energy company ENI (ENI.MI) and commodities trader Vitol for outstanding gas invoices related to electricity generation through the Sankofa Gas Project, the ministry said. The government also settled approximately $393 million in legacy debts owed to independent power producers, including $120 million to Turkey's Karpowership and $59.4 million to Cenpower Generation, according to a breakdown provided by the ministry. Independent power producers said in a separate statement that the clearance of long-outstanding obligations represents a major milestone in restoring financial stability and operational confidence across the power sector. The government has also renegotiated all agreements with independent power producers and is working with Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Jubilee Field partners on a payment roadmap, the ministry said. Ghana is seeking to boost domestic gas production and reduce its reliance on expensive liquid fuels.",

Even just an \"agreed roadmap\" for settlement of outstanding payments and and agreed price for future production would be quite helpful for negotiating decent terms of refinancing. Ghana clears $1.47 billion in energy debts, finance ministry says 12/01/2026 11:31 - RSF By Emmanuel Bruce ACCRA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ghana's government paid $1.47 billion in 2025 to clear legacy energy sector debts, restoring a depleted World Bank guarantee and settling arrears with power producers, the West African nation's finance ministry said on Monday. ------------ Ghana's power sector has been grappling with widespread unpaid debts that have led to a sharp increase in outages. Last year, President John Dramani Mahama promised to reduce the $2.5 billion owed to independent power producers and gas suppliers. \"The era of uncontrolled energy sector debt accumulation is over,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that disciplined financial management had enabled the payments while securing provisions for timely future obligations. The ministry said the government had repaid over $597 million to the World Bank, fully restoring the partial risk guarantee for gas supplies from the Offshore Cape Three Points field. The guarantee, established in 2015, was designed to protect nearly $8 billion in private investment in the energy sector. Its depletion had damaged the government's credibility with international partners. An additional $480 million was paid to Italian energy company ENI (ENI.MI) and commodities trader Vitol for outstanding gas invoices related to electricity generation through the Sankofa Gas Project, the ministry said. The government also settled approximately $393 million in legacy debts owed to independent power producers, including $120 million to Turkey's Karpowership and $59.4 million to Cenpower Generation, according to a breakdown provided by the ministry. Independent power producers said in a separate statement that the clearance of long-outstanding obligations represents a major milestone in restoring financial stability and operational confidence across the power sector. The government has also renegotiated all agreements with independent power producers and is working with Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Jubilee Field partners on a payment roadmap, the ministry said. Ghana is seeking to boost domestic gas production and reduce its reliance on expensive liquid fuels.",

Any realistic lender in Tullow's position would demand downside protection via hedges (likely multi-year collars/floors in the $60s or lower to guarantee repayments), repeating the 2021-2024 pattern. poor terms now could lock in capped upside and prolonged debt servitude IF they sign now and oil gets to $100 it won't mean anything for tullow.

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

These payments are contingent on future production commencing and are calculated based on the average annual Brent price at that time.

I am with those who think that whatever deal is struck will suck blood out of future FCF to the exclusive advantage of lenders for a few years to come, so that the relief rally will be short lived and give way to reality. I also believe that no normal lenders will be interested in lending to TLW in its current state: negative FCF, awful credit metrics and uncertain future production weigh too heavily on debt repayment probability and traditional lenders would require north of  12% interest which the company cannot sustain.  So, to avoid SH wipe out (some are quite powerful better keep them sweet) the only way I see it is an oil player (from minor to major to trader or else) who could see the potential of eventually owning a profitable restructured company while keeping risk exposure low as a lender.  I would structure it as a convertible note, and would relax collar hedging rules by allowing a lower coupon to pay for keeping more upside in OP spikes. ( collar hedge implies buying a put and selling a call to protect on the downside and sacrifice on the upside. This is usually a zero cost, but if I want to keep more of the upside it will cost me: if I am vested in the company future success as a potential owner post conversion I would rather pay a premium to allow TLW to keep more of OP ups and pay for it by accepting a coupon of, say, 8% rather than 12%.  If the company succeeds (new wells, tax resolutions, Ghana payments etc.)  I will convert and own a healthy company I bought for free, if not I will put it in default and own whatever oil reserves will be there. I am in the oil business so I will know how to deal with it.  And us? We will be massively diluted but owning a piece of a profitable restructured enterprise, otherwise we will be no worse than we are today, owning equity in a negative book value TLW going nowhere. I wish you all the best of luck, I do not think I would have a lot to contribute on this blog for a while.....",

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

By tapping into the additional layer alongside the primary ones, it achieved an initial flow rate that significantly contributed to the field\u2019s return to ~70,000 bopd gross. Capex Efficiency: Because the reservoir is more connected, the partnership may be able to defer or cancel some future \"infill\" wells, as the current wells are draining a larger volume of the reservoir than planned.

          "content": "Had a chat with chatgpt about latest reservoir updates from Jubilee field.. it sounds really interesting... ---------- Here is a succinct summary of the technical and operational updates regarding Tullow Oil and the Jubilee Field as of January 2026: Technical & Operational Breakthroughs Reservoir Connectivity: Recent petrophysical logs from the J-72 and J-74 wells confirmed superior pressure communication across reservoir compartments. This indicates the field acts as a more unified hydraulic system than previously modeled, allowing for more efficient drainage. Additional Production Layers: Drilling operations by the Noble Venturer intercepted new high-quality sand intervals (net pay) at deeper or lateral horizons. These additional layers were not fully accounted for in prior reserve estimates. Production Impact: This geological \"upside\" helped restore gross production at Jubilee to approximately 70,000 bopd in early 2026, offsetting natural decline and providing a path toward the 100,000 bopd medium-term target. License Extension: Based on these incremental reserves and the enhanced reservoir model, the Government of Ghana granted a formal extension for the Jubilee and TEN licenses until 2040, significantly boosting the company\u2019s Net Asset Value (NAV). Financial Context Equity vs. Debt: The identification of these additional reserves is being used by management to argue that the company is asset-rich but cash-constrained. This supports the narrative that a \"debt-for-equity swap\" is unnecessary, as the underlying asset value far exceeds the current depressed market cap (~\u00a3117M). Regarding the additional layers and technical specifics, here is the breakdown of what was discovered during the recent Jubilee South East (JSE) drilling campaign (late 2025/early 2026): 1. Geological Specifics: The \"Deep Jubilee\" Horizons The latest wells (specifically J-74) targeted the Turonian turbidite sands. While the original models focused on the primary \"Mahogany\" and \"Teak\" horizons, these wells intercepted: Extra \"Net Pay\": A previously secondary or unmapped lower sand interval proved to be significantly thicker than anticipated, adding roughly 50 meters of high-quality net pay. Reservoir Quality: Petrophysical logs (LWD - Logging While Drilling) showed porosity and permeability in these deeper layers that matched or exceeded the primary reservoirs, which is rare for deeper horizons. 2. Enhanced Connectivity & \"Pressure Support\" The technical breakthrough isn't just the extra oil; it's how it moves: Vertical Communication: Pressure tests (MDT/RFT) confirmed that these additional layers are in hydraulic communication with the main reservoir body. This means they act as a \"pressure buffer,\" helping to maintain the natural flow of the field longer than expected. Lateral Continuity: The logs suggest these sands are more continuous across the field rather than being isolated \"pods.\" (Continues...)",

But the fact of the matter is US GOA refineries are predominately configured for heavy aiui. Let's ask AI:- \"Yes, WTI (West Texas Intermediate) shale oil is refined in the US, but a significant portion is also exported due to a mismatch between domestic production and refinery configurations. The Refining Mismatch Production vs. Configuration: Approximately 80% of US shale production is light, sweet crude. However, nearly 70% of US refining capacity, particularly along the Gulf Coast, is designed to run more efficiently on heavy, sour crude. Historical Investment: Long before the shale boom, Gulf Coast refiners invested billions into complex units like cokers to process heavy imports from Venezuela, Mexico, and Canada. Refine and Export: While US refiners have added some capacity for light crude, it is often more economic to export the \"excess\" light shale oil and import the heavy crude their complex machines were built for. Benefits of Venezuelan Crude Access to Venezuelan crude is considered highly beneficial for US Gulf Coast refineries for several reasons: Ideal Feedstock: Many Gulf Coast facilities were originally designed specifically for the \"dense, sticky\" characteristics of Venezuelan oil. Economic Efficiency: Using heavy Venezuelan crude allows refiners to fully utilize their expensive coking and hydrocracking units, which are currently under-utilised or fed with more expensive alternatives. Higher Yields: Heavy crude is essential for producing high volumes of distillate diesel and jet fuel, products that complex Gulf refineries specialize in. Cost and Proximity: Venezuela offers a cheaper alternative to Canadian heavy oil due to lower shipping costs (shorter tanker trips vs. long-distance pipelines) and a frequent market discount.....\"",

Venezuela produce very heavy oil which can be conveniently blended with lighter shale oil in order to increase the share of US oil available to their refineries. US industry needs have always been the driver behind major moves in the energy sector: when Russia converted their refineries to feed Europe with their low sulfur distillates, then the propaganda against diesel engines was started and gasoline was imposed by the EU as the \"cleanest fuel\" . Then Germany tried to save its automotive industry by forcing transition to electrical to the whole EU while in the meantime converting their engines to the crappy electrical/hybrid models that we are forced to buy at twice the price. It's all about money and it's all about power. Every country is slave to another (with one major exception) and has slaves to submit for compensation purposes. Hence \"trains or misfortune\" are formed, like US-Germany-France-Italy-Greece and-the-like.",

However laughable (especially considering oil demand stubbornly on the rise at worldwide level) this implies a nightmarish scenario for indebted companies like TLW. OP repricing is obviously helping in this regard - Current OP around 70$ allows oil companies to further hedge against future drops (?) at cheaper conditions. Hopefully TLW won't overindulge in this, like 6 years ago. - odds of a new conflict involving Iran are rising every day. An oil spike to thre digit area would have the effect or an earthquake on a such shorted market and industry overall. Needless to say, the real issue for TLW is debt refinancing. If this happened in the current geopolitical scenario and with the further good news coming from the reservoir (additional wells and additional production layers introduced) with additional positive news coming from Ghana about outstanding payments, then the effect on the SP would be immense.

Institutional investors of China, India etc. are like sheep being herded through a narrow gate. Now FRES is predominantly a silver miner and silver went from $20/Oz to $120/Oz. Their cost model was based on a much lower price per ounce and now they have massively exceeded expectations, it's like increasing production by a factor of 5 without extra operating costs.

If your time line is couple of years 300m buys you almost double in debt, the rest held by IIs can be extended with payments that TLW will be able to afford.",

          "content": "Hi all.  I have to disagree with those who see refinancing as a catalyst for SP recovery. I am with those who think that whatever deal is struck will suck blood out of future FCF to the exclusive advantage of lenders for a few years to come, so that the relief rally will be short lived and give way to reality. I also believe that no normal lenders will be interested in lending to TLW in its current state: negative FCF, awful credit metrics and uncertain future production weigh too heavily on debt repayment probability and traditional lenders would require north of  12% interest which the company cannot sustain.  So, to avoid SH wipe out (some are quite powerful better keep them sweet) the only way I see it is an oil player (from minor to major to trader or else) who could see the potential of eventually owning a profitable restructured company while keeping risk exposure low as a lender.  I would structure it as a convertible note, and would relax collar hedging rules by allowing a lower coupon to pay for keeping more upside in OP spikes. ( collar hedge implies buying a put and selling a call to protect on the downside and sacrifice on the upside. This is usually a zero cost, but if I want to keep more of the upside it will cost me: if I am vested in the company future success as a potential owner post conversion I would rather pay a premium to allow TLW to keep more of OP ups and pay for it by accepting a coupon of, say, 8% rather than 12%.  If the company succeeds (new wells, tax resolutions, Ghana payments etc.)  I will convert and own a healthy company I bought for free, if not I will put it in default and own whatever oil reserves will be there. I am in the oil business so I will know how to deal with it.  And us? We will be massively diluted but owning a piece of a profitable restructured enterprise, otherwise we will be no worse than we are today, owning equity in a negative book value TLW going nowhere. I wish you all the best of luck, I do not think I would have a lot to contribute on this blog for a while.....",

Any realistic lender in Tullow's position would demand downside protection via hedges (likely multi-year collars/floors in the $60s or lower to guarantee repayments), repeating the 2021-2024 pattern. poor terms now could lock in capped upside and prolonged debt servitude IF they sign now and oil gets to $100 it won't mean anything for tullow.

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

Gemini------> For offshore oil cargo operations in Ghana, Quantity and Quality (Q&Q) analysis is a continuous process that occurs in three distinct phases: Pre-loading, During loading, and Post-loading. The analysis is conducted by an independent third-party inspector (e.g., SGS Ghana or Intertek) who boards the export tanker via a shuttle boat or helicopter before operations begin. 1. Pre-Loading Phase (Establish Baseline) Where: Onboard the receiving export tanker. When: Immediately after the tanker arrives and the \"Key Meeting\" between the inspector, the tanker's master, and the FPSO representative is completed. Activity: The inspector gauges all cargo tanks to determine the On Board Quantity (OBQ)\u2014any residual oil or \"slops\" remaining from previous voyages\u2014to ensure it is not counted as part of the new shipment. They also verify tank cleanliness to prevent contamination. 2. During Loading Phase (Real-Time Monitoring) Where: Primarily at the FPSO's metering skid and the tanker\u2019s manifold. When: Throughout the 24\u201336 hour pumping window. Activity: Quantity: High-precision custody transfer meters on the FPSO provide the primary volume data. Quality: Automatic samplers at the FPSO manifold collect a \"composite sample\" proportionally throughout the entire load. This sample represents the average quality of the 950K barrels. 3. Post-Loading Phase (Final Certification) Where: Onboard the export tanker and in an onshore laboratory (usually in Takoradi). When: Immediately after the \"Stop\" command is given and the hoses are disconnected. Activity: Final Gauging: The inspector performs manual ullage measurements of the tanker\u2019s tanks to calculate the Total Received Volume. Lab Analysis: The composite sample is taken ashore (or sometimes tested in a small onboard lab) to determine critical commercial factors: API Gravity, Sulphur content, and BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water). The results from this final phase are used to issue the Certificate of Quantity and Certificate of Quality, which are the legal documents required to trigger the 30-day payment clock.",

Pricing Window (Days 1\u20135): The final price is typically calculated using the 5-day average of Dated Brent immediately following the B/L date. Quality & Quantity (Q&Q) Certification: Independent inspectors verify the final volume and quality (e.g., API gravity, sulphur content). Commercial Invoice Issuance: Once the pricing period ends and Q&Q results are available, the seller issues the final commercial invoice. Standard Payment Due Date: Most major contracts (e.g., Tullow or NNPC) specify payment 30 days from the B/L date. Banking Processing (Day 30+): International bank transfers (typically via SWIFT MT103) can take 1 to 5 working days to clear into the producer's account.\"",

But anyway there's a point in the operation when the uncouple the 'pipe' when the barrels on loaded to the tanker which becomes the effective date subject to a 'bill of lading' having been received. I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements. Gut feel is the timings outlined still apply.",

I further interrogated Gemini on this point, it actually said that the outstanding payments would be included in the transaction, i.e. TLW would accept to receive only a part of those 200M and in return Ghana would \"accept\" to purchase an additional stake in the field at a market price (rather than at a major discount, as one would expect in a distressed debt case). One more interesting point it raised is that we are not dealing with a \"bankrupt company\" here, as the intrinsic value of the assets is likely much higher than the combination of current capitalization + debt. Rather, it's a typical case of liquidity crisis. Accordingly, it should not be ruled out that major shareholders (and, potentially also GNPC) agree for a capital increase aimed at just partially reducing the debt (e.g. 300 M) by purchasing additional shares at a higher price than the market price. Though counterintuitive, this scenario (including potentially backstopped right issues) would be quite profitable even for the participants in the recapitalization as the SP would easily double or triple as a result of the resolution of the debt crisis. Should Ghana take part in this \"white knight\" recapitalization, they would also increase their share in the field. All in all, a combination of \"amend and extend\", increase of GNPC share and limited recapitalization with a \"floor SP price\" could be an outcome that makes all stakeholders happy (without destroying the residual shareholders, BTW).",

          "content": "I interrogated Gemini on possible outcomes of the debt issue and the response is that a (partial?) takeover by Ghana is one of the most likely outcomes: ---- Summary: The Strategic Case for a Jubilee Divestment & State Swap The prospect of Tullow selling a 10% stake in the Jubilee field is now considered a high-probability \"liquidity bridge\" as the May 2026 deadline approaches. This strategy is reinforced by two critical factors: The Kosmos Precedent: In early 2026, the GNPC (Ghana National Petroleum Corporation) successfully executed a $199 million acquisition of a 7% interest in Jubilee and TEN from Kosmos Energy. This transaction sets a clear market benchmark and confirms the Ghanaian government's \"pre-emptive\" strategy to consolidate ownership of its most productive assets using available capital. The $200M Arrears Leverage: Tullow currently carries over $200 million in outstanding receivables from the Ghanaian government. A \"Debt-for-Asset\" swap is highly likely: instead of demanding cash that could further strain Ghana's fiscal position, Tullow could trade a portion of its Jubilee stake back to the state. This would simultaneously wipe out the government's debt and provide Tullow with the balance sheet relief needed to satisfy its bondholders. Valuation Impact: Based on the Kosmos deal, a 10% stake in Jubilee is estimated to be worth between $250M and $350M. For Tullow, this is a game-changer: It validates that the company\u2019s assets are worth significantly more than its current \u00a3100M market cap. It provides a non-dilutive way to raise cash, avoiding the \"death spiral\" of issuing new shares at 6-7 pence. It aligns with Roald Goethe\u2019s strategy of deep political engagement to de-risk the company's Ghanaian operations. Conclusion: By following the path already cleared by Kosmos and using the $200M in unpaid bills as a bargaining chip, Tullow has a credible \"Plan B\" to survive May 2026. This move would transform the company into a leaner, state-partnered entity, potentially triggering a massive re-rating of the share price as the threat of bankruptcy vanishes.",

A......Yes, you are spot on. The original discovery and appraisal wells in the Main Field (like Mahogany-1 and Mahogany-2) did penetrate the deeper Turonian section, but they failed to find commercial \"Mahogany Deep\" oil directly beneath the main reservoirs in that area. Instead, those deeper levels in the Main Field were typically found to be water-bearing or contained only minor, non-commercial shows. The stratigraphic distinction between the two areas is as follows: Main Field (North/West): The primary Mahogany sands (UM/LM) are structurally at their highest and most productive. When initial wells like Mahogany-1 (2007) drilled deeper, they found that the high-quality sands effectively \"ran out\" or became water-saturated at depth. The \"Mahogany Deep\" Discovery: It wasn't until Mahogany-3 (drilled southeast of the Main Field) that a separate, deeper stratigraphic trap was identified. This well proved that the Mahogany Deep accumulation existed as a distinct \"step-out\" feature to the south and east rather than a simple vertical extension of the Main Field. The Difference: The reason the deeper levels failed in the Main Field but worked in JSE/South is due to stratigraphic pinch-outs and trap geometry. The Mahogany Deep reservoirs are chronostratigraphically distinct deposystems that ponded in a different part of the palaeo-slope. So, while recent Main Field wells like J74 are finding \"better than expected\" pay, they are doing so by intersecting extra thickness or secondary zones within the known Upper/Lower Mahogany sequence, rather than tapping into the specific Mahogany Deep pool found further southeast.",

Operational Impact The \"J-74\" Result: This specific well was completed across three distinct zones simultaneously. By tapping into the additional layer alongside the primary ones, it achieved an initial flow rate that significantly contributed to the field\u2019s return to ~70,000 bopd gross. Capex Efficiency: Because the reservoir is more connected, the partnership may be able to defer or cancel some future \"infill\" wells, as the current wells are draining a larger volume of the reservoir than planned.

          "content": "Had a chat with chatgpt about latest reservoir updates from Jubilee field.. it sounds really interesting... ---------- Here is a succinct summary of the technical and operational updates regarding Tullow Oil and the Jubilee Field as of January 2026: Technical & Operational Breakthroughs Reservoir Connectivity: Recent petrophysical logs from the J-72 and J-74 wells confirmed superior pressure communication across reservoir compartments. This indicates the field acts as a more unified hydraulic system than previously modeled, allowing for more efficient drainage. Additional Production Layers: Drilling operations by the Noble Venturer intercepted new high-quality sand intervals (net pay) at deeper or lateral horizons. These additional layers were not fully accounted for in prior reserve estimates. Production Impact: This geological \"upside\" helped restore gross production at Jubilee to approximately 70,000 bopd in early 2026, offsetting natural decline and providing a path toward the 100,000 bopd medium-term target. License Extension: Based on these incremental reserves and the enhanced reservoir model, the Government of Ghana granted a formal extension for the Jubilee and TEN licenses until 2040, significantly boosting the company\u2019s Net Asset Value (NAV). Financial Context Equity vs. Debt: The identification of these additional reserves is being used by management to argue that the company is asset-rich but cash-constrained. This supports the narrative that a \"debt-for-equity swap\" is unnecessary, as the underlying asset value far exceeds the current depressed market cap (~\u00a3117M). Regarding the additional layers and technical specifics, here is the breakdown of what was discovered during the recent Jubilee South East (JSE) drilling campaign (late 2025/early 2026): 1. Geological Specifics: The \"Deep Jubilee\" Horizons The latest wells (specifically J-74) targeted the Turonian turbidite sands. While the original models focused on the primary \"Mahogany\" and \"Teak\" horizons, these wells intercepted: Extra \"Net Pay\": A previously secondary or unmapped lower sand interval proved to be significantly thicker than anticipated, adding roughly 50 meters of high-quality net pay. Reservoir Quality: Petrophysical logs (LWD - Logging While Drilling) showed porosity and permeability in these deeper layers that matched or exceeded the primary reservoirs, which is rare for deeper horizons. 2. Enhanced Connectivity & \"Pressure Support\" The technical breakthrough isn't just the extra oil; it's how it moves: Vertical Communication: Pressure tests (MDT/RFT) confirmed that these additional layers are in hydraulic communication with the main reservoir body. This means they act as a \"pressure buffer,\" helping to maintain the natural flow of the field longer than expected. Lateral Continuity: The logs suggest these sands are more continuous across the field rather than being isolated \"pods.\" (Continues...)",

But the fact of the matter is US GOA refineries are predominately configured for heavy aiui. Let's ask AI:- \"Yes, WTI (West Texas Intermediate) shale oil is refined in the US, but a significant portion is also exported due to a mismatch between domestic production and refinery configurations. The Refining Mismatch Production vs. Configuration: Approximately 80% of US shale production is light, sweet crude. However, nearly 70% of US refining capacity, particularly along the Gulf Coast, is designed to run more efficiently on heavy, sour crude. Historical Investment: Long before the shale boom, Gulf Coast refiners invested billions into complex units like cokers to process heavy imports from Venezuela, Mexico, and Canada. Refine and Export: While US refiners have added some capacity for light crude, it is often more economic to export the \"excess\" light shale oil and import the heavy crude their complex machines were built for. Benefits of Venezuelan Crude Access to Venezuelan crude is considered highly beneficial for US Gulf Coast refineries for several reasons: Ideal Feedstock: Many Gulf Coast facilities were originally designed specifically for the \"dense, sticky\" characteristics of Venezuelan oil. Economic Efficiency: Using heavy Venezuelan crude allows refiners to fully utilize their expensive coking and hydrocracking units, which are currently under-utilised or fed with more expensive alternatives. Higher Yields: Heavy crude is essential for producing high volumes of distillate diesel and jet fuel, products that complex Gulf refineries specialize in. Cost and Proximity: Venezuela offers a cheaper alternative to Canadian heavy oil due to lower shipping costs (shorter tanker trips vs. long-distance pipelines) and a frequent market discount.....\"",

Venezuela produce very heavy oil which can be conveniently blended with lighter shale oil in order to increase the share of US oil available to their refineries. US industry needs have always been the driver behind major moves in the energy sector: when Russia converted their refineries to feed Europe with their low sulfur distillates, then the propaganda against diesel engines was started and gasoline was imposed by the EU as the \"cleanest fuel\" . Then Germany tried to save its automotive industry by forcing transition to electrical to the whole EU while in the meantime converting their engines to the crappy electrical/hybrid models that we are forced to buy at twice the price. It's all about money and it's all about power. Every country is slave to another (with one major exception) and has slaves to submit for compensation purposes. Hence \"trains or misfortune\" are formed, like US-Germany-France-Italy-Greece and-the-like.",

However laughable (especially considering oil demand stubbornly on the rise at worldwide level) this implies a nightmarish scenario for indebted companies like TLW. OP repricing is obviously helping in this regard - Current OP around 70$ allows oil companies to further hedge against future drops (?) at cheaper conditions. Hopefully TLW won't overindulge in this, like 6 years ago. - odds of a new conflict involving Iran are rising every day. An oil spike to thre digit area would have the effect or an earthquake on a such shorted market and industry overall. Needless to say, the real issue for TLW is debt refinancing. If this happened in the current geopolitical scenario and with the further good news coming from the reservoir (additional wells and additional production layers introduced) with additional positive news coming from Ghana about outstanding payments, then the effect on the SP would be immense.

Metal miners were also unloved for decades and right now your neighbour and his dog are buying gold. The central bank of Poland is buying gold at the all time high, now where were they 3 years ago? Institutional investors of China, India etc. are like sheep being herded through a narrow gate. Now FRES is predominantly a silver miner and silver went from $20/Oz to $120/Oz. Their cost model was based on a much lower price per ounce and now they have massively exceeded expectations, it's like increasing production by a factor of 5 without extra operating costs. There's no magic involved in the share price surge.",

These payments are contingent on future production commencing and are calculated based on the average annual Brent price at that time.

If your time line is couple of years 300m buys you almost double in debt, the rest held by IIs can be extended with payments that TLW will be able to afford.",

          "content": "Hi all.  I have to disagree with those who see refinancing as a catalyst for SP recovery. I am with those who think that whatever deal is struck will suck blood out of future FCF to the exclusive advantage of lenders for a few years to come, so that the relief rally will be short lived and give way to reality. I also believe that no normal lenders will be interested in lending to TLW in its current state: negative FCF, awful credit metrics and uncertain future production weigh too heavily on debt repayment probability and traditional lenders would require north of  12% interest which the company cannot sustain.  So, to avoid SH wipe out (some are quite powerful better keep them sweet) the only way I see it is an oil player (from minor to major to trader or else) who could see the potential of eventually owning a profitable restructured company while keeping risk exposure low as a lender.  I would structure it as a convertible note, and would relax collar hedging rules by allowing a lower coupon to pay for keeping more upside in OP spikes. ( collar hedge implies buying a put and selling a call to protect on the downside and sacrifice on the upside. This is usually a zero cost, but if I want to keep more of the upside it will cost me: if I am vested in the company future success as a potential owner post conversion I would rather pay a premium to allow TLW to keep more of OP ups and pay for it by accepting a coupon of, say, 8% rather than 12%.  If the company succeeds (new wells, tax resolutions, Ghana payments etc.)  I will convert and own a healthy company I bought for free, if not I will put it in default and own whatever oil reserves will be there. I am in the oil business so I will know how to deal with it.  And us? We will be massively diluted but owning a piece of a profitable restructured enterprise, otherwise we will be no worse than we are today, owning equity in a negative book value TLW going nowhere. I wish you all the best of luck, I do not think I would have a lot to contribute on this blog for a while.....",

Any realistic lender in Tullow's position would demand downside protection via hedges (likely multi-year collars/floors in the $60s or lower to guarantee repayments), repeating the 2021-2024 pattern. poor terms now could lock in capped upside and prolonged debt servitude IF they sign now and oil gets to $100 it won't mean anything for tullow. Tullow will be a debt  w h'ore. at low oil prices to pay back lenders for 3 years",

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

Gemini------> For offshore oil cargo operations in Ghana, Quantity and Quality (Q&Q) analysis is a continuous process that occurs in three distinct phases: Pre-loading, During loading, and Post-loading. The analysis is conducted by an independent third-party inspector (e.g., SGS Ghana or Intertek) who boards the export tanker via a shuttle boat or helicopter before operations begin. 1. Pre-Loading Phase (Establish Baseline) Where: Onboard the receiving export tanker. When: Immediately after the tanker arrives and the \"Key Meeting\" between the inspector, the tanker's master, and the FPSO representative is completed. Activity: The inspector gauges all cargo tanks to determine the On Board Quantity (OBQ)\u2014any residual oil or \"slops\" remaining from previous voyages\u2014to ensure it is not counted as part of the new shipment. They also verify tank cleanliness to prevent contamination. 2. During Loading Phase (Real-Time Monitoring) Where: Primarily at the FPSO's metering skid and the tanker\u2019s manifold. When: Throughout the 24\u201336 hour pumping window. Activity: Quantity: High-precision custody transfer meters on the FPSO provide the primary volume data. Quality: Automatic samplers at the FPSO manifold collect a \"composite sample\" proportionally throughout the entire load. This sample represents the average quality of the 950K barrels. 3. Post-Loading Phase (Final Certification) Where: Onboard the export tanker and in an onshore laboratory (usually in Takoradi). When: Immediately after the \"Stop\" command is given and the hoses are disconnected. Activity: Final Gauging: The inspector performs manual ullage measurements of the tanker\u2019s tanks to calculate the Total Received Volume. Lab Analysis: The composite sample is taken ashore (or sometimes tested in a small onboard lab) to determine critical commercial factors: API Gravity, Sulphur content, and BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water). The results from this final phase are used to issue the Certificate of Quantity and Certificate of Quality, which are the legal documents required to trigger the 30-day payment clock.",

The general drift was correct but according to Gemini \"Typical Payment Timeline The sequence from loading to cash receipt follows a standardized industry workflow: Bill of Lading (B/L) Date (Day 0): This is the date loading is completed at the offshore installation. Pricing Window (Days 1\u20135): The final price is typically calculated using the 5-day average of Dated Brent immediately following the B/L date. Quality & Quantity (Q&Q) Certification: Independent inspectors verify the final volume and quality (e.g., API gravity, sulphur content). Commercial Invoice Issuance: Once the pricing period ends and Q&Q results are available, the seller issues the final commercial invoice. Standard Payment Due Date: Most major contracts (e.g., Tullow or NNPC) specify payment 30 days from the B/L date. Banking Processing (Day 30+): International bank transfers (typically via SWIFT MT103) can take 1 to 5 working days to clear into the producer's account.\"",

I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements. Gut feel is the timings outlined still apply.",

Gemini------> For offshore oil cargo operations in Ghana, Quantity and Quality (Q&Q) analysis is a continuous process that occurs in three distinct phases: Pre-loading, During loading, and Post-loading. The analysis is conducted by an independent third-party inspector (e.g., SGS Ghana or Intertek) who boards the export tanker via a shuttle boat or helicopter before operations begin. 1. Pre-Loading Phase (Establish Baseline) Where: Onboard the receiving export tanker. When: Immediately after the tanker arrives and the \"Key Meeting\" between the inspector, the tanker's master, and the FPSO representative is completed. Activity: The inspector gauges all cargo tanks to determine the On Board Quantity (OBQ)\u2014any residual oil or \"slops\" remaining from previous voyages\u2014to ensure it is not counted as part of the new shipment. They also verify tank cleanliness to prevent contamination. 2. During Loading Phase (Real-Time Monitoring) Where: Primarily at the FPSO's metering skid and the tanker\u2019s manifold. When: Throughout the 24\u201336 hour pumping window. Activity: Quantity: High-precision custody transfer meters on the FPSO provide the primary volume data. Quality: Automatic samplers at the FPSO manifold collect a \"composite sample\" proportionally throughout the entire load. This sample represents the average quality of the 950K barrels. 3. Post-Loading Phase (Final Certification) Where: Onboard the export tanker and in an onshore laboratory (usually in Takoradi). When: Immediately after the \"Stop\" command is given and the hoses are disconnected. Activity: Final Gauging: The inspector performs manual ullage measurements of the tanker\u2019s tanks to calculate the Total Received Volume. Lab Analysis: The composite sample is taken ashore (or sometimes tested in a small onboard lab) to determine critical commercial factors: API Gravity, Sulphur content, and BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water). The results from this final phase are used to issue the Certificate of Quantity and Certificate of Quality, which are the legal documents required to trigger the 30-day payment clock.",

The general drift was correct but according to Gemini \"Typical Payment Timeline The sequence from loading to cash receipt follows a standardized industry workflow: Bill of Lading (B/L) Date (Day 0): This is the date loading is completed at the offshore installation. Pricing Window (Days 1\u20135): The final price is typically calculated using the 5-day average of Dated Brent immediately following the B/L date. Quality & Quantity (Q&Q) Certification: Independent inspectors verify the final volume and quality (e.g., API gravity, sulphur content). Commercial Invoice Issuance: Once the pricing period ends and Q&Q results are available, the seller issues the final commercial invoice. Standard Payment Due Date: Most major contracts (e.g., Tullow or NNPC) specify payment 30 days from the B/L date. Banking Processing (Day 30+): International bank transfers (typically via SWIFT MT103) can take 1 to 5 working days to clear into the producer's account.\"",

I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements.

I further interrogated Gemini on this point, it actually said that the outstanding payments would be included in the transaction, i.e. TLW would accept to receive only a part of those 200M and in return Ghana would \"accept\" to purchase an additional stake in the field at a market price (rather than at a major discount, as one would expect in a distressed debt case). One more interesting point it raised is that we are not dealing with a \"bankrupt company\" here, as the intrinsic value of the assets is likely much higher than the combination of current capitalization + debt. Rather, it's a typical case of liquidity crisis. Accordingly, it should not be ruled out that major shareholders (and, potentially also GNPC) agree for a capital increase aimed at just partially reducing the debt (e.g. 300 M) by purchasing additional shares at a higher price than the market price. Though counterintuitive, this scenario (including potentially backstopped right issues) would be quite profitable even for the participants in the recapitalization as the SP would easily double or triple as a result of the resolution of the debt crisis. Should Ghana take part in this \"white knight\" recapitalization, they would also increase their share in the field. All in all, a combination of \"amend and extend\", increase of GNPC share and limited recapitalization with a \"floor SP price\" could be an outcome that makes all stakeholders happy (without destroying the residual shareholders, BTW).",

          "content": "I interrogated Gemini on possible outcomes of the debt issue and the response is that a (partial?) takeover by Ghana is one of the most likely outcomes: ---- Summary: The Strategic Case for a Jubilee Divestment & State Swap The prospect of Tullow selling a 10% stake in the Jubilee field is now considered a high-probability \"liquidity bridge\" as the May 2026 deadline approaches. This strategy is reinforced by two critical factors: The Kosmos Precedent: In early 2026, the GNPC (Ghana National Petroleum Corporation) successfully executed a $199 million acquisition of a 7% interest in Jubilee and TEN from Kosmos Energy. This transaction sets a clear market benchmark and confirms the Ghanaian government's \"pre-emptive\" strategy to consolidate ownership of its most productive assets using available capital. The $200M Arrears Leverage: Tullow currently carries over $200 million in outstanding receivables from the Ghanaian government. A \"Debt-for-Asset\" swap is highly likely: instead of demanding cash that could further strain Ghana's fiscal position, Tullow could trade a portion of its Jubilee stake back to the state. This would simultaneously wipe out the government's debt and provide Tullow with the balance sheet relief needed to satisfy its bondholders. Valuation Impact: Based on the Kosmos deal, a 10% stake in Jubilee is estimated to be worth between $250M and $350M. For Tullow, this is a game-changer: It validates that the company\u2019s assets are worth significantly more than its current \u00a3100M market cap. It provides a non-dilutive way to raise cash, avoiding the \"death spiral\" of issuing new shares at 6-7 pence. It aligns with Roald Goethe\u2019s strategy of deep political engagement to de-risk the company's Ghanaian operations. Conclusion: By following the path already cleared by Kosmos and using the $200M in unpaid bills as a bargaining chip, Tullow has a credible \"Plan B\" to survive May 2026. This move would transform the company into a leaner, state-partnered entity, potentially triggering a massive re-rating of the share price as the threat of bankruptcy vanishes.",

          "content": "Q/ but didn't the original main field discovery wells and some of the subsequent main field appraisal wells also target deeper turonian levels which presumably failed to find \"MAH Deep\" below main field? A......Yes, you are spot on. The original discovery and appraisal wells in the Main Field (like Mahogany-1 and Mahogany-2) did penetrate the deeper Turonian section, but they failed to find commercial \"Mahogany Deep\" oil directly beneath the main reservoirs in that area. Instead, those deeper levels in the Main Field were typically found to be water-bearing or contained only minor, non-commercial shows. The stratigraphic distinction between the two areas is as follows: Main Field (North/West): The primary Mahogany sands (UM/LM) are structurally at their highest and most productive. When initial wells like Mahogany-1 (2007) drilled deeper, they found that the high-quality sands effectively \"ran out\" or became water-saturated at depth. The \"Mahogany Deep\" Discovery: It wasn't until Mahogany-3 (drilled southeast of the Main Field) that a separate, deeper stratigraphic trap was identified. This well proved that the Mahogany Deep accumulation existed as a distinct \"step-out\" feature to the south and east rather than a simple vertical extension of the Main Field. The Difference: The reason the deeper levels failed in the Main Field but worked in JSE/South is due to stratigraphic pinch-outs and trap geometry. The Mahogany Deep reservoirs are chronostratigraphically distinct deposystems that ponded in a different part of the palaeo-slope. So, while recent Main Field wells like J74 are finding \"better than expected\" pay, they are doing so by intersecting extra thickness or secondary zones within the known Upper/Lower Mahogany sequence, rather than tapping into the specific Mahogany Deep pool found further southeast.",

This indicates the field acts as a more unified hydraulic system than previously modeled, allowing for more efficient drainage. Additional Production Layers: Drilling operations by the Noble Venturer intercepted new high-quality sand intervals (net pay) at deeper or lateral horizons. These additional layers were not fully accounted for in prior reserve estimates. Production Impact: This geological \"upside\" helped restore gross production at Jubilee to approximately 70,000 bopd in early 2026, offsetting natural decline and providing a path toward the 100,000 bopd medium-term target. License Extension: Based on these incremental reserves and the enhanced reservoir model, the Government of Ghana granted a formal extension for the Jubilee and TEN licenses until 2040, significantly boosting the company\u2019s Net Asset Value (NAV). Financial Context Equity vs. Debt: The identification of these additional reserves is being used by management to argue that the company is asset-rich but cash-constrained. This supports the narrative that a \"debt-for-equity swap\" is unnecessary, as the underlying asset value far exceeds the current depressed market cap (~\u00a3117M). Regarding the additional layers and technical specifics, here is the breakdown of what was discovered during the recent Jubilee South East (JSE) drilling campaign (late 2025/early 2026): 1. Geological Specifics: The \"Deep Jubilee\" Horizons The latest wells (specifically J-74) targeted the Turonian turbidite sands. While the original models focused on the primary \"Mahogany\" and \"Teak\" horizons, these wells intercepted: Extra \"Net Pay\": A previously secondary or unmapped lower sand interval proved to be significantly thicker than anticipated, adding roughly 50 meters of high-quality net pay. Reservoir Quality: Petrophysical logs (LWD - Logging While Drilling) showed porosity and permeability in these deeper layers that matched or exceeded the primary reservoirs, which is rare for deeper horizons. 2. Enhanced Connectivity & \"Pressure Support\" The technical breakthrough isn't just the extra oil; it's how it moves: Vertical Communication: Pressure tests (MDT/RFT) confirmed that these additional layers are in hydraulic communication with the main reservoir body. This means they act as a \"pressure buffer,\" helping to maintain the natural flow of the field longer than expected. Lateral Continuity: The logs suggest these sands are more continuous across the field rather than being isolated \"pods.\" (Continues...)",

But the fact of the matter is US GOA refineries are predominately configured for heavy aiui. Let's ask AI:- \"Yes, WTI (West Texas Intermediate) shale oil is refined in the US, but a significant portion is also exported due to a mismatch between domestic production and refinery configurations. The Refining Mismatch Production vs. Configuration: Approximately 80% of US shale production is light, sweet crude. However, nearly 70% of US refining capacity, particularly along the Gulf Coast, is designed to run more efficiently on heavy, sour crude. Historical Investment: Long before the shale boom, Gulf Coast refiners invested billions into complex units like cokers to process heavy imports from Venezuela, Mexico, and Canada. Refine and Export: While US refiners have added some capacity for light crude, it is often more economic to export the \"excess\" light shale oil and import the heavy crude their complex machines were built for. Benefits of Venezuelan Crude Access to Venezuelan crude is considered highly beneficial for US Gulf Coast refineries for several reasons: Ideal Feedstock: Many Gulf Coast facilities were originally designed specifically for the \"dense, sticky\" characteristics of Venezuelan oil. Economic Efficiency: Using heavy Venezuelan crude allows refiners to fully utilize their expensive coking and hydrocracking units, which are currently under-utilised or fed with more expensive alternatives. Higher Yields: Heavy crude is essential for producing high volumes of distillate diesel and jet fuel, products that complex Gulf refineries specialize in. Cost and Proximity: Venezuela offers a cheaper alternative to Canadian heavy oil due to lower shipping costs (shorter tanker trips vs. long-distance pipelines) and a frequent market discount.....\"",

Venezuela produce very heavy oil which can be conveniently blended with lighter shale oil in order to increase the share of US oil available to their refineries. US industry needs have always been the driver behind major moves in the energy sector: when Russia converted their refineries to feed Europe with their low sulfur distillates, then the propaganda against diesel engines was started and gasoline was imposed by the EU as the \"cleanest fuel\" . Then Germany tried to save its automotive industry by forcing transition to electrical to the whole EU while in the meantime converting their engines to the crappy electrical/hybrid models that we are forced to buy at twice the price. It's all about money and it's all about power. Every country is slave to another (with one major exception) and has slaves to submit for compensation purposes. Hence \"trains or misfortune\" are formed, like US-Germany-France-Italy-Greece and-the-like.",

However laughable (especially considering oil demand stubbornly on the rise at worldwide level) this implies a nightmarish scenario for indebted companies like TLW. OP repricing is obviously helping in this regard - Current OP around 70$ allows oil companies to further hedge against future drops (?) at cheaper conditions. Hopefully TLW won't overindulge in this, like 6 years ago. - odds of a new conflict involving Iran are rising every day. An oil spike to thre digit area would have the effect or an earthquake on a such shorted market and industry overall. Needless to say, the real issue for TLW is debt refinancing. If this happened in the current geopolitical scenario and with the further good news coming from the reservoir (additional wells and additional production layers introduced) with additional positive news coming from Ghana about outstanding payments, then the effect on the SP would be immense.

Institutional investors of China, India etc. are like sheep being herded through a narrow gate. Now FRES is predominantly a silver miner and silver went from $20/Oz to $120/Oz. Their cost model was based on a much lower price per ounce and now they have massively exceeded expectations, it's like increasing production by a factor of 5 without extra operating costs.

I could never understand why they haven't tried to reduce debt by buying some portion of the coupons directly from the market at a heavily discounted price!

If your time line is couple of years 300m buys you almost double in debt, the rest held by IIs can be extended with payments that TLW will be able to afford.",

          "content": "Hi all.  I have to disagree with those who see refinancing as a catalyst for SP recovery. I am with those who think that whatever deal is struck will suck blood out of future FCF to the exclusive advantage of lenders for a few years to come, so that the relief rally will be short lived and give way to reality. I also believe that no normal lenders will be interested in lending to TLW in its current state: negative FCF, awful credit metrics and uncertain future production weigh too heavily on debt repayment probability and traditional lenders would require north of  12% interest which the company cannot sustain.  So, to avoid SH wipe out (some are quite powerful better keep them sweet) the only way I see it is an oil player (from minor to major to trader or else) who could see the potential of eventually owning a profitable restructured company while keeping risk exposure low as a lender.  I would structure it as a convertible note, and would relax collar hedging rules by allowing a lower coupon to pay for keeping more upside in OP spikes. ( collar hedge implies buying a put and selling a call to protect on the downside and sacrifice on the upside. This is usually a zero cost, but if I want to keep more of the upside it will cost me: if I am vested in the company future success as a potential owner post conversion I would rather pay a premium to allow TLW to keep more of OP ups and pay for it by accepting a coupon of, say, 8% rather than 12%.  If the company succeeds (new wells, tax resolutions, Ghana payments etc.)  I will convert and own a healthy company I bought for free, if not I will put it in default and own whatever oil reserves will be there. I am in the oil business so I will know how to deal with it.  And us? We will be massively diluted but owning a piece of a profitable restructured enterprise, otherwise we will be no worse than we are today, owning equity in a negative book value TLW going nowhere. I wish you all the best of luck, I do not think I would have a lot to contribute on this blog for a while.....",

Any realistic lender in Tullow's position would demand downside protection via hedges (likely multi-year collars/floors in the $60s or lower to guarantee repayments), repeating the 2021-2024 pattern. poor terms now could lock in capped upside and prolonged debt servitude IF they sign now and oil gets to $100 it won't mean anything for tullow.

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

Assuming you buy now: \u00a310k initial purchase \u2013 8p = 125,000 shares Divide by a 100 ratio = 1,250 shares x 8p = \u00a3100 As you can see the initial \u00a310k would be virtually impossible to recover, as it requires a SP at \u00a38, which is an increase of around 10,000%.

When: Immediately after the \"Stop\" command is given and the hoses are disconnected. Activity: Final Gauging: The inspector performs manual ullage measurements of the tanker\u2019s tanks to calculate the Total Received Volume. Lab Analysis: The composite sample is taken ashore (or sometimes tested in a small onboard lab) to determine critical commercial factors: API Gravity, Sulphur content, and BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water). The results from this final phase are used to issue the Certificate of Quantity and Certificate of Quality, which are the legal documents required to trigger the 30-day payment clock.",

I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements.

But anyway there's a point in the operation when the uncouple the 'pipe' when the barrels on loaded to the tanker which becomes the effective date subject to a 'bill of lading' having been received. I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements. Gut feel is the timings outlined still apply.",

I further interrogated Gemini on this point, it actually said that the outstanding payments would be included in the transaction, i.e. TLW would accept to receive only a part of those 200M and in return Ghana would \"accept\" to purchase an additional stake in the field at a market price (rather than at a major discount, as one would expect in a distressed debt case). One more interesting point it raised is that we are not dealing with a \"bankrupt company\" here, as the intrinsic value of the assets is likely much higher than the combination of current capitalization + debt. Rather, it's a typical case of liquidity crisis. Accordingly, it should not be ruled out that major shareholders (and, potentially also GNPC) agree for a capital increase aimed at just partially reducing the debt (e.g. 300 M) by purchasing additional shares at a higher price than the market price. Though counterintuitive, this scenario (including potentially backstopped right issues) would be quite profitable even for the participants in the recapitalization as the SP would easily double or triple as a result of the resolution of the debt crisis. Should Ghana take part in this \"white knight\" recapitalization, they would also increase their share in the field. All in all, a combination of \"amend and extend\", increase of GNPC share and limited recapitalization with a \"floor SP price\" could be an outcome that makes all stakeholders happy (without destroying the residual shareholders, BTW).",

          "content": "I interrogated Gemini on possible outcomes of the debt issue and the response is that a (partial?) takeover by Ghana is one of the most likely outcomes: ---- Summary: The Strategic Case for a Jubilee Divestment & State Swap The prospect of Tullow selling a 10% stake in the Jubilee field is now considered a high-probability \"liquidity bridge\" as the May 2026 deadline approaches. This strategy is reinforced by two critical factors: The Kosmos Precedent: In early 2026, the GNPC (Ghana National Petroleum Corporation) successfully executed a $199 million acquisition of a 7% interest in Jubilee and TEN from Kosmos Energy. This transaction sets a clear market benchmark and confirms the Ghanaian government's \"pre-emptive\" strategy to consolidate ownership of its most productive assets using available capital. The $200M Arrears Leverage: Tullow currently carries over $200 million in outstanding receivables from the Ghanaian government. A \"Debt-for-Asset\" swap is highly likely: instead of demanding cash that could further strain Ghana's fiscal position, Tullow could trade a portion of its Jubilee stake back to the state. This would simultaneously wipe out the government's debt and provide Tullow with the balance sheet relief needed to satisfy its bondholders. Valuation Impact: Based on the Kosmos deal, a 10% stake in Jubilee is estimated to be worth between $250M and $350M. For Tullow, this is a game-changer: It validates that the company\u2019s assets are worth significantly more than its current \u00a3100M market cap. It provides a non-dilutive way to raise cash, avoiding the \"death spiral\" of issuing new shares at 6-7 pence. It aligns with Roald Goethe\u2019s strategy of deep political engagement to de-risk the company's Ghanaian operations. Conclusion: By following the path already cleared by Kosmos and using the $200M in unpaid bills as a bargaining chip, Tullow has a credible \"Plan B\" to survive May 2026. This move would transform the company into a leaner, state-partnered entity, potentially triggering a massive re-rating of the share price as the threat of bankruptcy vanishes.",

The original discovery and appraisal wells in the Main Field (like Mahogany-1 and Mahogany-2) did penetrate the deeper Turonian section, but they failed to find commercial \"Mahogany Deep\" oil directly beneath the main reservoirs in that area. Instead, those deeper levels in the Main Field were typically found to be water-bearing or contained only minor, non-commercial shows. The stratigraphic distinction between the two areas is as follows: Main Field (North/West): The primary Mahogany sands (UM/LM) are structurally at their highest and most productive. When initial wells like Mahogany-1 (2007) drilled deeper, they found that the high-quality sands effectively \"ran out\" or became water-saturated at depth. The \"Mahogany Deep\" Discovery: It wasn't until Mahogany-3 (drilled southeast of the Main Field) that a separate, deeper stratigraphic trap was identified. This well proved that the Mahogany Deep accumulation existed as a distinct \"step-out\" feature to the south and east rather than a simple vertical extension of the Main Field. The Difference: The reason the deeper levels failed in the Main Field but worked in JSE/South is due to stratigraphic pinch-outs and trap geometry. The Mahogany Deep reservoirs are chronostratigraphically distinct deposystems that ponded in a different part of the palaeo-slope. So, while recent Main Field wells like J74 are finding \"better than expected\" pay, they are doing so by intersecting extra thickness or secondary zones within the known Upper/Lower Mahogany sequence, rather than tapping into the specific Mahogany Deep pool found further southeast.",

This indicates the field acts as a more unified hydraulic system than previously modeled, allowing for more efficient drainage. Additional Production Layers: Drilling operations by the Noble Venturer intercepted new high-quality sand intervals (net pay) at deeper or lateral horizons. These additional layers were not fully accounted for in prior reserve estimates. Production Impact: This geological \"upside\" helped restore gross production at Jubilee to approximately 70,000 bopd in early 2026, offsetting natural decline and providing a path toward the 100,000 bopd medium-term target. License Extension: Based on these incremental reserves and the enhanced reservoir model, the Government of Ghana granted a formal extension for the Jubilee and TEN licenses until 2040, significantly boosting the company\u2019s Net Asset Value (NAV). Financial Context Equity vs. Debt: The identification of these additional reserves is being used by management to argue that the company is asset-rich but cash-constrained. This supports the narrative that a \"debt-for-equity swap\" is unnecessary, as the underlying asset value far exceeds the current depressed market cap (~\u00a3117M). Regarding the additional layers and technical specifics, here is the breakdown of what was discovered during the recent Jubilee South East (JSE) drilling campaign (late 2025/early 2026): 1. Geological Specifics: The \"Deep Jubilee\" Horizons The latest wells (specifically J-74) targeted the Turonian turbidite sands. While the original models focused on the primary \"Mahogany\" and \"Teak\" horizons, these wells intercepted: Extra \"Net Pay\": A previously secondary or unmapped lower sand interval proved to be significantly thicker than anticipated, adding roughly 50 meters of high-quality net pay. Reservoir Quality: Petrophysical logs (LWD - Logging While Drilling) showed porosity and permeability in these deeper layers that matched or exceeded the primary reservoirs, which is rare for deeper horizons. 2. Enhanced Connectivity & \"Pressure Support\" The technical breakthrough isn't just the extra oil; it's how it moves: Vertical Communication: Pressure tests (MDT/RFT) confirmed that these additional layers are in hydraulic communication with the main reservoir body. This means they act as a \"pressure buffer,\" helping to maintain the natural flow of the field longer than expected. Lateral Continuity: The logs suggest these sands are more continuous across the field rather than being isolated \"pods.\" (Continues...)",

But the fact of the matter is US GOA refineries are predominately configured for heavy aiui. Let's ask AI:- \"Yes, WTI (West Texas Intermediate) shale oil is refined in the US, but a significant portion is also exported due to a mismatch between domestic production and refinery configurations. The Refining Mismatch Production vs. Configuration: Approximately 80% of US shale production is light, sweet crude. However, nearly 70% of US refining capacity, particularly along the Gulf Coast, is designed to run more efficiently on heavy, sour crude. Historical Investment: Long before the shale boom, Gulf Coast refiners invested billions into complex units like cokers to process heavy imports from Venezuela, Mexico, and Canada. Refine and Export: While US refiners have added some capacity for light crude, it is often more economic to export the \"excess\" light shale oil and import the heavy crude their complex machines were built for. Benefits of Venezuelan Crude Access to Venezuelan crude is considered highly beneficial for US Gulf Coast refineries for several reasons: Ideal Feedstock: Many Gulf Coast facilities were originally designed specifically for the \"dense, sticky\" characteristics of Venezuelan oil. Economic Efficiency: Using heavy Venezuelan crude allows refiners to fully utilize their expensive coking and hydrocracking units, which are currently under-utilised or fed with more expensive alternatives. Higher Yields: Heavy crude is essential for producing high volumes of distillate diesel and jet fuel, products that complex Gulf refineries specialize in. Cost and Proximity: Venezuela offers a cheaper alternative to Canadian heavy oil due to lower shipping costs (shorter tanker trips vs. long-distance pipelines) and a frequent market discount.....\"",

Venezuela produce very heavy oil which can be conveniently blended with lighter shale oil in order to increase the share of US oil available to their refineries. US industry needs have always been the driver behind major moves in the energy sector: when Russia converted their refineries to feed Europe with their low sulfur distillates, then the propaganda against diesel engines was started and gasoline was imposed by the EU as the \"cleanest fuel\" . Then Germany tried to save its automotive industry by forcing transition to electrical to the whole EU while in the meantime converting their engines to the crappy electrical/hybrid models that we are forced to buy at twice the price. It's all about money and it's all about power. Every country is slave to another (with one major exception) and has slaves to submit for compensation purposes. Hence \"trains or misfortune\" are formed, like US-Germany-France-Italy-Greece and-the-like.",

However laughable (especially considering oil demand stubbornly on the rise at worldwide level) this implies a nightmarish scenario for indebted companies like TLW. OP repricing is obviously helping in this regard - Current OP around 70$ allows oil companies to further hedge against future drops (?) at cheaper conditions. Hopefully TLW won't overindulge in this, like 6 years ago. - odds of a new conflict involving Iran are rising every day. An oil spike to thre digit area would have the effect or an earthquake on a such shorted market and industry overall. Needless to say, the real issue for TLW is debt refinancing. If this happened in the current geopolitical scenario and with the further good news coming from the reservoir (additional wells and additional production layers introduced) with additional positive news coming from Ghana about outstanding payments, then the effect on the SP would be immense.

Metal miners were also unloved for decades and right now your neighbour and his dog are buying gold. The central bank of Poland is buying gold at the all time high, now where were they 3 years ago? Institutional investors of China, India etc. are like sheep being herded through a narrow gate. Now FRES is predominantly a silver miner and silver went from $20/Oz to $120/Oz. Their cost model was based on a much lower price per ounce and now they have massively exceeded expectations, it's like increasing production by a factor of 5 without extra operating costs. There's no magic involved in the share price surge.",

These payments are contingent on future production commencing and are calculated based on the average annual Brent price at that time.

If your time line is couple of years 300m buys you almost double in debt, the rest held by IIs can be extended with payments that TLW will be able to afford.",

          "content": "Hi all.  I have to disagree with those who see refinancing as a catalyst for SP recovery. I am with those who think that whatever deal is struck will suck blood out of future FCF to the exclusive advantage of lenders for a few years to come, so that the relief rally will be short lived and give way to reality. I also believe that no normal lenders will be interested in lending to TLW in its current state: negative FCF, awful credit metrics and uncertain future production weigh too heavily on debt repayment probability and traditional lenders would require north of  12% interest which the company cannot sustain.  So, to avoid SH wipe out (some are quite powerful better keep them sweet) the only way I see it is an oil player (from minor to major to trader or else) who could see the potential of eventually owning a profitable restructured company while keeping risk exposure low as a lender.  I would structure it as a convertible note, and would relax collar hedging rules by allowing a lower coupon to pay for keeping more upside in OP spikes. ( collar hedge implies buying a put and selling a call to protect on the downside and sacrifice on the upside. This is usually a zero cost, but if I want to keep more of the upside it will cost me: if I am vested in the company future success as a potential owner post conversion I would rather pay a premium to allow TLW to keep more of OP ups and pay for it by accepting a coupon of, say, 8% rather than 12%.  If the company succeeds (new wells, tax resolutions, Ghana payments etc.)  I will convert and own a healthy company I bought for free, if not I will put it in default and own whatever oil reserves will be there. I am in the oil business so I will know how to deal with it.  And us? We will be massively diluted but owning a piece of a profitable restructured enterprise, otherwise we will be no worse than we are today, owning equity in a negative book value TLW going nowhere. I wish you all the best of luck, I do not think I would have a lot to contribute on this blog for a while.....",

Any realistic lender in Tullow's position would demand downside protection via hedges (likely multi-year collars/floors in the $60s or lower to guarantee repayments), repeating the 2021-2024 pattern. poor terms now could lock in capped upside and prolonged debt servitude IF they sign now and oil gets to $100 it won't mean anything for tullow.

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",

If on the one hand I'm relieved that you are getting increasingly more confident about TLW' production and management overall of Jubilee, on the other hand I concur that we are still blind as nobody really knows what's happening behind the curtains. Clearly TLW is not a broken company, but rather a company in a liquidity crisis but with significant oil reserves and cash flow. My personal opinion is that once the liquidity crisis is addressed someway, then a flow of positives might follow suit: resolution of outstanding payments, additional 2P reserves, and potentially even exploration wells. Market is apparently finally understanding that the \"supply glut\" has never materialized, nor will it do in the future and accordingly oil companies SP are skyrocketing even in the current depressed OP scenario. Everything points to an imminent repricing of TLW. Nobody knows, though, if this will be achieved (also) at the expense of shareholders. I expect a (relatively small) recapitalization will be part of the deal, but the SP will react positively to any decent refinancing scheme, and accordingly such recapitalization could be a good business for participants. Whatever, we can just wait and see, and hope.",

Assuming you buy now: \u00a310k initial purchase \u2013 8p = 125,000 shares Divide by a 100 ratio = 1,250 shares x 8p = \u00a3100 As you can see the initial \u00a310k would be virtually impossible to recover, as it requires a SP at \u00a38, which is an increase of around 10,000%.

Gemini------> For offshore oil cargo operations in Ghana, Quantity and Quality (Q&Q) analysis is a continuous process that occurs in three distinct phases: Pre-loading, During loading, and Post-loading. The analysis is conducted by an independent third-party inspector (e.g., SGS Ghana or Intertek) who boards the export tanker via a shuttle boat or helicopter before operations begin. 1. Pre-Loading Phase (Establish Baseline) Where: Onboard the receiving export tanker. When: Immediately after the tanker arrives and the \"Key Meeting\" between the inspector, the tanker's master, and the FPSO representative is completed. Activity: The inspector gauges all cargo tanks to determine the On Board Quantity (OBQ)\u2014any residual oil or \"slops\" remaining from previous voyages\u2014to ensure it is not counted as part of the new shipment. They also verify tank cleanliness to prevent contamination. 2. During Loading Phase (Real-Time Monitoring) Where: Primarily at the FPSO's metering skid and the tanker\u2019s manifold. When: Throughout the 24\u201336 hour pumping window. Activity: Quantity: High-precision custody transfer meters on the FPSO provide the primary volume data. Quality: Automatic samplers at the FPSO manifold collect a \"composite sample\" proportionally throughout the entire load. This sample represents the average quality of the 950K barrels. 3. Post-Loading Phase (Final Certification) Where: Onboard the export tanker and in an onshore laboratory (usually in Takoradi). When: Immediately after the \"Stop\" command is given and the hoses are disconnected. Activity: Final Gauging: The inspector performs manual ullage measurements of the tanker\u2019s tanks to calculate the Total Received Volume. Lab Analysis: The composite sample is taken ashore (or sometimes tested in a small onboard lab) to determine critical commercial factors: API Gravity, Sulphur content, and BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water). The results from this final phase are used to issue the Certificate of Quantity and Certificate of Quality, which are the legal documents required to trigger the 30-day payment clock.",

The general drift was correct but according to Gemini \"Typical Payment Timeline The sequence from loading to cash receipt follows a standardized industry workflow: Bill of Lading (B/L) Date (Day 0): This is the date loading is completed at the offshore installation. Pricing Window (Days 1\u20135): The final price is typically calculated using the 5-day average of Dated Brent immediately following the B/L date. Quality & Quantity (Q&Q) Certification: Independent inspectors verify the final volume and quality (e.g., API gravity, sulphur content). Commercial Invoice Issuance: Once the pricing period ends and Q&Q results are available, the seller issues the final commercial invoice. Standard Payment Due Date: Most major contracts (e.g., Tullow or NNPC) specify payment 30 days from the B/L date. Banking Processing (Day 30+): International bank transfers (typically via SWIFT MT103) can take 1 to 5 working days to clear into the producer's account.\"",

But anyway there's a point in the operation when the uncouple the 'pipe' when the barrels on loaded to the tanker which becomes the effective date subject to a 'bill of lading' having been received. I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements. Gut feel is the timings outlined still apply.",

The general drift was correct but according to Gemini \"Typical Payment Timeline The sequence from loading to cash receipt follows a standardized industry workflow: Bill of Lading (B/L) Date (Day 0): This is the date loading is completed at the offshore installation. Pricing Window (Days 1\u20135): The final price is typically calculated using the 5-day average of Dated Brent immediately following the B/L date. Quality & Quantity (Q&Q) Certification: Independent inspectors verify the final volume and quality (e.g., API gravity, sulphur content). Commercial Invoice Issuance: Once the pricing period ends and Q&Q results are available, the seller issues the final commercial invoice. Standard Payment Due Date: Most major contracts (e.g., Tullow or NNPC) specify payment 30 days from the B/L date. Banking Processing (Day 30+): International bank transfers (typically via SWIFT MT103) can take 1 to 5 working days to clear into the producer's account.\"",

But anyway there's a point in the operation when the uncouple the 'pipe' when the barrels on loaded to the tanker which becomes the effective date subject to a 'bill of lading' having been received. I understand that should happen on or about the same date. The price received would usually be the 5 day ave brent from that Bill of Lading date. So in simple terms it ought to be the 5 day brent ave from tomorrow with the 'cash' received electronically sometime later (probably less than 30 days later?). Now that is what used to happen and probably still does but we don't exactly know if the Glencore arrangements have modified these standard arrangements. Gut feel is the timings outlined still apply.",

I further interrogated Gemini on this point, it actually said that the outstanding payments would be included in the transaction, i.e. TLW would accept to receive only a part of those 200M and in return Ghana would \"accept\" to purchase an additional stake in the field at a market price (rather than at a major discount, as one would expect in a distressed debt case). One more interesting point it raised is that we are not dealing with a \"bankrupt company\" here, as the intrinsic value of the assets is likely much higher than the combination of current capitalization + debt. Rather, it's a typical case of liquidity crisis. Accordingly, it should not be ruled out that major shareholders (and, potentially also GNPC) agree for a capital increase aimed at just partially reducing the debt (e.g. 300 M) by purchasing additional shares at a higher price than the market price. Though counterintuitive, this scenario (including potentially backstopped right issues) would be quite profitable even for the participants in the recapitalization as the SP would easily double or triple as a result of the resolution of the debt crisis. Should Ghana take part in this \"white knight\" recapitalization, they would also increase their share in the field. All in all, a combination of \"amend and extend\", increase of GNPC share and limited recapitalization with a \"floor SP price\" could be an outcome that makes all stakeholders happy (without destroying the residual shareholders, BTW).",

          "content": "I interrogated Gemini on possible outcomes of the debt issue and the response is that a (partial?) takeover by Ghana is one of the most likely outcomes: ---- Summary: The Strategic Case for a Jubilee Divestment & State Swap The prospect of Tullow selling a 10% stake in the Jubilee field is now considered a high-probability \"liquidity bridge\" as the May 2026 deadline approaches. This strategy is reinforced by two critical factors: The Kosmos Precedent: In early 2026, the GNPC (Ghana National Petroleum Corporation) successfully executed a $199 million acquisition of a 7% interest in Jubilee and TEN from Kosmos Energy. This transaction sets a clear market benchmark and confirms the Ghanaian government's \"pre-emptive\" strategy to consolidate ownership of its most productive assets using available capital. The $200M Arrears Leverage: Tullow currently carries over $200 million in outstanding receivables from the Ghanaian government. A \"Debt-for-Asset\" swap is highly likely: instead of demanding cash that could further strain Ghana's fiscal position, Tullow could trade a portion of its Jubilee stake back to the state. This would simultaneously wipe out the government's debt and provide Tullow with the balance sheet relief needed to satisfy its bondholders. Valuation Impact: Based on the Kosmos deal, a 10% stake in Jubilee is estimated to be worth between $250M and $350M. For Tullow, this is a game-changer: It validates that the company\u2019s assets are worth significantly more than its current \u00a3100M market cap. It provides a non-dilutive way to raise cash, avoiding the \"death spiral\" of issuing new shares at 6-7 pence. It aligns with Roald Goethe\u2019s strategy of deep political engagement to de-risk the company's Ghanaian operations. Conclusion: By following the path already cleared by Kosmos and using the $200M in unpaid bills as a bargaining chip, Tullow has a credible \"Plan B\" to survive May 2026. This move would transform the company into a leaner, state-partnered entity, potentially triggering a massive re-rating of the share price as the threat of bankruptcy vanishes.",

But my personal feeling is that TLW management is dealing with this and many other issues by the same table with their most important stakeholders. Unfortunately, we're blind.

          "content": "Q/ but didn't the original main field discovery wells and some of the subsequent main field appraisal wells also target deeper turonian levels which presumably failed to find \"MAH Deep\" below main field? A......Yes, you are spot on. The original discovery and appraisal wells in the Main Field (like Mahogany-1 and Mahogany-2) did penetrate the deeper Turonian section, but they failed to find commercial \"Mahogany Deep\" oil directly beneath the main reservoirs in that area. Instead, those deeper levels in the Main Field were typically found to be water-bearing or contained only minor, non-commercial shows. The stratigraphic distinction between the two areas is as follows: Main Field (North/West): The primary Mahogany sands (UM/LM) are structurally at their highest and most productive. When initial wells like Mahogany-1 (2007) drilled deeper, they found that the high-quality sands effectively \"ran out\" or became water-saturated at depth. The \"Mahogany Deep\" Discovery: It wasn't until Mahogany-3 (drilled southeast of the Main Field) that a separate, deeper stratigraphic trap was identified. This well proved that the Mahogany Deep accumulation existed as a distinct \"step-out\" feature to the south and east rather than a simple vertical extension of the Main Field. The Difference: The reason the deeper levels failed in the Main Field but worked in JSE/South is due to stratigraphic pinch-outs and trap geometry. The Mahogany Deep reservoirs are chronostratigraphically distinct deposystems that ponded in a different part of the palaeo-slope. So, while recent Main Field wells like J74 are finding \"better than expected\" pay, they are doing so by intersecting extra thickness or secondary zones within the known Upper/Lower Mahogany sequence, rather than tapping into the specific Mahogany Deep pool found further southeast.",

This indicates the field acts as a more unified hydraulic system than previously modeled, allowing for more efficient drainage. Additional Production Layers: Drilling operations by the Noble Venturer intercepted new high-quality sand intervals (net pay) at deeper or lateral horizons. These additional layers were not fully accounted for in prior reserve estimates. Production Impact: This geological \"upside\" helped restore gross production at Jubilee to approximately 70,000 bopd in early 2026, offsetting natural decline and providing a path toward the 100,000 bopd medium-term target. License Extension: Based on these incremental reserves and the enhanced reservoir model, the Government of Ghana granted a formal extension for the Jubilee and TEN licenses until 2040, significantly boosting the company\u2019s Net Asset Value (NAV). Financial Context Equity vs. Debt: The identification of these additional reserves is being used by management to argue that the company is asset-rich but cash-constrained. This supports the narrative that a \"debt-for-equity swap\" is unnecessary, as the underlying asset value far exceeds the current depressed market cap (~\u00a3117M). Regarding the additional layers and technical specifics, here is the breakdown of what was discovered during the recent Jubilee South East (JSE) drilling campaign (late 2025/early 2026): 1. Geological Specifics: The \"Deep Jubilee\" Horizons The latest wells (specifically J-74) targeted the Turonian turbidite sands. While the original models focused on the primary \"Mahogany\" and \"Teak\" horizons, these wells intercepted: Extra \"Net Pay\": A previously secondary or unmapped lower sand interval proved to be significantly thicker than anticipated, adding roughly 50 meters of high-quality net pay. Reservoir Quality: Petrophysical logs (LWD - Logging While Drilling) showed porosity and permeability in these deeper layers that matched or exceeded the primary reservoirs, which is rare for deeper horizons. 2. Enhanced Connectivity & \"Pressure Support\" The technical breakthrough isn't just the extra oil; it's how it moves: Vertical Communication: Pressure tests (MDT/RFT) confirmed that these additional layers are in hydraulic communication with the main reservoir body. This means they act as a \"pressure buffer,\" helping to maintain the natural flow of the field longer than expected. Lateral Continuity: The logs suggest these sands are more continuous across the field rather than being isolated \"pods.\" (Continues...)",

But the fact of the matter is US GOA refineries are predominately configured for heavy aiui. Let's ask AI:- \"Yes, WTI (West Texas Intermediate) shale oil is refined in the US, but a significant portion is also exported due to a mismatch between domestic production and refinery configurations. The Refining Mismatch Production vs. Configuration: Approximately 80% of US shale production is light, sweet crude. However, nearly 70% of US refining capacity, particularly along the Gulf Coast, is designed to run more efficiently on heavy, sour crude. Historical Investment: Long before the shale boom, Gulf Coast refiners invested billions into complex units like cokers to process heavy imports from Venezuela, Mexico, and Canada. Refine and Export: While US refiners have added some capacity for light crude, it is often more economic to export the \"excess\" light shale oil and import the heavy crude their complex machines were built for. Benefits of Venezuelan Crude Access to Venezuelan crude is considered highly beneficial for US Gulf Coast refineries for several reasons: Ideal Feedstock: Many Gulf Coast facilities were originally designed specifically for the \"dense, sticky\" characteristics of Venezuelan oil. Economic Efficiency: Using heavy Venezuelan crude allows refiners to fully utilize their expensive coking and hydrocracking units, which are currently under-utilised or fed with more expensive alternatives. Higher Yields: Heavy crude is essential for producing high volumes of distillate diesel and jet fuel, products that complex Gulf refineries specialize in. Cost and Proximity: Venezuela offers a cheaper alternative to Canadian heavy oil due to lower shipping costs (shorter tanker trips vs. long-distance pipelines) and a frequent market discount.....\"",

Venezuela produce very heavy oil which can be conveniently blended with lighter shale oil in order to increase the share of US oil available to their refineries. US industry needs have always been the driver behind major moves in the energy sector: when Russia converted their refineries to feed Europe with their low sulfur distillates, then the propaganda against diesel engines was started and gasoline was imposed by the EU as the \"cleanest fuel\" . Then Germany tried to save its automotive industry by forcing transition to electrical to the whole EU while in the meantime converting their engines to the crappy electrical/hybrid models that we are forced to buy at twice the price. It's all about money and it's all about power. Every country is slave to another (with one major exception) and has slaves to submit for compensation purposes. Hence \"trains or misfortune\" are formed, like US-Germany-France-Italy-Greece and-the-like.",

However laughable (especially considering oil demand stubbornly on the rise at worldwide level) this implies a nightmarish scenario for indebted companies like TLW. OP repricing is obviously helping in this regard - Current OP around 70$ allows oil companies to further hedge against future drops (?) at cheaper conditions. Hopefully TLW won't overindulge in this, like 6 years ago. - odds of a new conflict involving Iran are rising every day. An oil spike to thre digit area would have the effect or an earthquake on a such shorted market and industry overall. Needless to say, the real issue for TLW is debt refinancing. If this happened in the current geopolitical scenario and with the further good news coming from the reservoir (additional wells and additional production layers introduced) with additional positive news coming from Ghana about outstanding payments, then the effect on the SP would be immense.

Institutional investors of China, India etc. are like sheep being herded through a narrow gate. Now FRES is predominantly a silver miner and silver went from $20/Oz to $120/Oz. Their cost model was based on a much lower price per ounce and now they have massively exceeded expectations, it's like increasing production by a factor of 5 without extra operating costs.

These payments are contingent on future production commencing and are calculated based on the average annual Brent price at that time.

I could never understand why they haven't tried to reduce debt by buying some portion of the coupons directly from the market at a heavily discounted price!

If your time line is couple of years 300m buys you almost double in debt, the rest held by IIs can be extended with payments that TLW will be able to afford.",

          "content": "Hi all.  I have to disagree with those who see refinancing as a catalyst for SP recovery. I am with those who think that whatever deal is struck will suck blood out of future FCF to the exclusive advantage of lenders for a few years to come, so that the relief rally will be short lived and give way to reality. I also believe that no normal lenders will be interested in lending to TLW in its current state: negative FCF, awful credit metrics and uncertain future production weigh too heavily on debt repayment probability and traditional lenders would require north of  12% interest which the company cannot sustain.  So, to avoid SH wipe out (some are quite powerful better keep them sweet) the only way I see it is an oil player (from minor to major to trader or else) who could see the potential of eventually owning a profitable restructured company while keeping risk exposure low as a lender.  I would structure it as a convertible note, and would relax collar hedging rules by allowing a lower coupon to pay for keeping more upside in OP spikes. ( collar hedge implies buying a put and selling a call to protect on the downside and sacrifice on the upside. This is usually a zero cost, but if I want to keep more of the upside it will cost me: if I am vested in the company future success as a potential owner post conversion I would rather pay a premium to allow TLW to keep more of OP ups and pay for it by accepting a coupon of, say, 8% rather than 12%.  If the company succeeds (new wells, tax resolutions, Ghana payments etc.)  I will convert and own a healthy company I bought for free, if not I will put it in default and own whatever oil reserves will be there. I am in the oil business so I will know how to deal with it.  And us? We will be massively diluted but owning a piece of a profitable restructured enterprise, otherwise we will be no worse than we are today, owning equity in a negative book value TLW going nowhere. I wish you all the best of luck, I do not think I would have a lot to contribute on this blog for a while.....",

Any realistic lender in Tullow's position would demand downside protection via hedges (likely multi-year collars/floors in the $60s or lower to guarantee repayments), repeating the 2021-2024 pattern. poor terms now could lock in capped upside and prolonged debt servitude IF they sign now and oil gets to $100 it won't mean anything for tullow.

          "content": "Still no date yet\u2026.. seems a little odd. ChatGPT Here\u2019s how it works for Tullow Oil plc (a company with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange): \ud83d\udcca 1. There\u2019s no automatic January trading update requirement UK listed companies do not have a specific legal rule that forces them to issue a \u201cJanuary trading update\u201d every year on a set date. What Tullow has done in the past \u2014 issuing trading statements in January ahead of its full-year results \u2014 is market practice, not a standalone regulatory obligation.  \ufffc However, Tullow has historically published a January Trading Statement & Operational Update in advance of its full-year results release on many occasions (e.g., January 2025 and previous years).  \ufffc \ud83d\udcc8 2. What UK listing and disclosure rules do require Two key regulatory frameworks govern this area for UK listed companies like Tullow: \u2714 Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR) Companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (like the LSE Main Market) must disclose inside information as soon as possible \u2014 that is, any information a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold shares. If a company delays disclosure, it must ensure such delay is lawful and confidential information remains confidential.  \ufffc This is the core trigger for announcements like trading updates: if the company has material information about performance or outlook before scheduled results, UK MAR requires disclosure to avoid creating a \u201cfalse market.\u201d \u2714 Continuous disclosure under the LSE Admission & Disclosure Standards While the Listing Rules/Admission standards don\u2019t require scheduled monthly or quarterly updates, they do require issuers to publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner via a Regulatory Information Service (RNS).  \ufffc Combined with UK MAR, this means companies must disclose material trading/operational developments as soon as they arise \u2014 but not that they must issue fixed \u201cJanuary\u201d trading statements each year. \ud83e\uddfe 3. So what determines if Tullow will publish one? Whether Tullow issues a January update in any given year depends on: \u2022\tWhether the board considers there is material information that needs market disclosure before its scheduled full-year results. \u2022\tCorporate communications policy and investor relations strategy, which often results in pre-results trading statements early in the year. \u2022\tTiming of results announcements \u2014 Tullow\u2019s full-year results are typically published later (e.g., March/April), so a January statement can help bridge the gap for investors.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccc Summary \u2022\tThere is no mandatory UK rule forcing Tullow to issue a January update every year. \u2022\tTullow chooses to issue January Trading Statements as a matter of market practice and investor communication. \u2022\tRegulatory obligations (UK MAR and LSE disclosure standards) require disclosure of material inside informati",
