CL2017 is now seeking recovery of these funds from the insurance company.\nAs announced on 16 May 2024, CL2017 had reached an agreement with some of the Sipiem defendants who were liable for a portion of the judgment, approximately \u20ac1.1million, to settle for\n\u20ac700,000. However, that settlement was subject to appeals court approval which was not received for technical legal reasons. Accordingly, CL2017 is now seeking to recover the outstanding \u20ac500,000 (being the difference between the settlement and judgment amounts above plus interest and further compensation for inflation loss over time) from these defendants. Towards this,\nenforcement action has been started in respect of properties owned by these defendants.\nThe defendants appealed in January 2025 to Italy\u2019s highest court in Rome against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. Despite this appeal, while it remains pending, CL2017 continues to have full legal authority to recover the entire \u20ac6 million plus interest and further compensation for inflation loss over time , less the \u20ac700,000 in settlement funds received from certain of the defendants (as announced on 16 May 2024 and as described above) and several tens of thousands of funds confiscated from the bank accounts of certain defendants.\nFurther to these recovery efforts, CL2017 has recently confiscated two real property assets valued by a surveyor in excess of \u20ac600,000. A third real property asset has been identified by CL2017 and a confiscation request has been duly filed.\nSimilarly, further enforcement actions have been, and will be, started against\nproperties belonging to the defendant\ns\nwho have already paid the above-mentioned \u20ac700,000\n. The two real properties mentioned above are set for auction on a date to be ordered shortly by a judge in Biella (the province where the properties are located).\nIn addition to the real property seizures, chattel assets owned by certain defendants have been confiscated, including approximately 20 items of artwork. CL2017 will obtain a valuation from an art expert as soon as practical.\nThe liquidation of these chattel assets will be carried out in accordance with Italian civil law procedure.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \u201cThe determination to collect the awarded damages is steadfast and will continue by CL2017 undeterred.\nThese efforts will continue until such time as the judgment is fully and finally satisfied or until CL2017 is confident that no more funds and assets are in the possession of any of the Sipiem defendants. All recovery action legally possible under Italian Civil Law has been, is and will be pursued by CL2017 for as long as it takes.\u201d\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.

As a result of these activities, QBT has entered into three non-disclosure agreements (\"NDA\") with three separate ASIC manufacturers, each of which has developed its own Bitcoin mining rig.\nThe process has reached the stage where these three companies will now be needing to make their mining rigs available to QBT's testing team at its laboratory in Milan, with access to their relevant source code. This will allow QBT to install the\nsoftware\nversion of Method C AI Oracle, the launch of which was announced on 12 November 2025, onto the third-party mining rigs. This will be the first step to allow each miner to assess the performance of the higher quality hashing rate provided by Method C.\nJoint analysis of the\nhardware\nversion of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new\nsoftware\nversion, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach.\nTherefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\nQBT has also recently signed an NDA with an innovative Bitcoin mining pool, where the goal is to enable the nodes of the pool to help miners generate better quality hash rates, leading to more Bitcoin being mined, which has been the main focus of QBT's R&D programme. While this represents a further development challenge for the R&D team behind Method C, it could potentially open up the possibility of bypassing the need to modify the operating system of all the mining rigs using the pool. New training data sets for the software version of Method C learning models are currently being analysed for this purpose.\nRegarding QBT's patent applications, the Company is working alongside its patent lawyers with patent examiners in Europe and the US to respond to these examiners' queries and objections. This is standard procedure for most patent applications, and the Company remains optimistic that it will see positive results.\nFinally, QBT is collaborating with a small startup which designs mining solutions around the Blockscale Intel ASIC. The two companies are conducting experiments on a wide variety of SHA-256 implementations from different manufacturers to determine the validity of the Company's three Methods: A, B and C in this specific environment.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman, commented\n, \"The Company is now engaged with the ASIC manufacturers it has been targeting over the past year. The Board believe QBT's technology proposition is unique within the Bitcoin industry, which is the main reason why there is such a high level of interest from mining companies assessing our technology. We firmly believe that the potential commercial advantage our Methods could bring to their mining rigs is an unprecedented and compelling technological proposition.\n\"As with any R&D focused business, we continue to develop and refine our Methods, with ongoing investments in personnel and equipment. Although it has taken time, we are now seeing the results of the frequent meetings we have held with the ASIC manufacturers, and we believe we have begun to develop a high level of trust with these companies; the first step to forging a strong collaborative partnership.\"\n-ends-\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.

This represents a major breakthrough for QBT, with time to market and initial capex costs for customers are expected to be reduced significantly.\nOver the past month, testing of the new software-only version in the Company's Milan laboratory has shown an average improvement in mining efficiency of over 10% - meaning, its capability of finding the winning hash at over 10% above the minimal difficulty threshold as set by most mining pools.\nFurther, the new software-only version of Method C has an additional commercial advantage, as it works in conjunction with the original hardware Oracle version of Method C to deliver compound efficiencies in Bitcoin mining.\nA collaboration is currently under way with a US-based ASIC manufacturer to test this new approach on their commercial miners.\nThe Company is also in advanced discussions with other US based ASIC manufacturers in the expectation that similar test programmes on their mining rigs will follow.\nTowards this, the Company is attending Mining Disrupt in Dallas, Texas from 11\nth\nto 13th November 2025.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \"The last six months have been crucial for this major R&D achievement which has involved, among other things, the generation of a staggering amount of mining data for the training of the new AI model.\n\"We can confirm that US-based ASIC manufacturers are making enquiries with us about our technology, as it potentially offers a key competitive element to take their miners from `hashing-rate' only performance, to quality hash generation.

The primary goal of the R&D programme is to develop Bitcoin mining tools and techniques, via its technology-driven approach, which the Company believes will significantly outperform existing market practices.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nI am pleased to present the Group\u2019s Interim Report for the first half of 2025, a period that has further strengthened Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 position as an innovator in the Bitcoin mining technology sector. Building on the achievements reported in and for 2024, the Company has continued to advance its research & development (\u201cR&D\u201d) programme, file new patents and deepen its engagement with potential strategic commercial partners, especially in\nNorth America\n. These developments further reinforce QBT\u2019s ambition to commercialise its disruptive technologies and secure a strong foothold in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\nTechnological and R&D Progress\nDuring the first half of 2025, Method C AI Oracle continued to be the centrepiece of QBT\u2019s innovation strategy. In January, the Company filed a patent application entitled \u201cImplementation of Binary Decision Trees\u201d, protecting the hardware implementation of Method C. This followed successful field-programmable gate array (\u201cFPGA\u201d) - based testing and the confirmation that Method C is able to deliver up to 30% improvement in mining efficiency on live Bitcoin blocks, either by reducing energy consumption or accelerating hash rates.\nQBT is currently collaborating with leading ASIC manufacturers to evaluate the implementation of the AI Oracle directly onto their chip architecture. Such a milestone could pave the way for licensing opportunities and long-term strategic partnerships.\nIn parallel, porting of Methods A and B (the Company\u2019s machine learning-driven optimisation techniques) onto Bitcoin mining rigs continued. QBT\u2019s implementation onto ESP-miner has been completed and live ASIC chip cryptocurrency mining commenced in the Company\u2019s\nMilan\nlaboratory. In\nJune 2025\n, QBT announced ongoing discussions with aftermarket control board providers to integrate these methods, which the board believes could allow rapid market penetration through existing miners worldwide.\nFurther, QBT\u2019s broader R&D pipeline remains active, with patent applications for ASIC UltraBoost and ASIC EnhancedBoost remaining pending, and a prototype design for an in-house ASIC mining chip preserved for potential future deployment. These initiatives collectively strengthen QBT\u2019s intellectual property base and broaden the commercialisation avenues available to the Company.\nCommercial Engagement and Industry Presence\nQBT has actively sought to align its R&D breakthroughs with commercial opportunities. In the first half of 2025, the Company presented to potential customers at the Mining Disrupt 2025 conference in\nFlorida\n, Bitcoin 2025 Las Vegas and Bitcoin Park in\nNashville\n, where Method C\u2019s AI Oracle attracted significant attention from leading ASIC manufacturers, mining pools and large-scale miners. These demonstrations have already led, for all three Methods, to follow-up discussions with third-parties, under non-disclosure agreements, underscoring the industry\u2019s growing recognition of QBT\u2019s disruptive technology.\nThe Company also launched a video presentation of the AI Oracle at the Bitcoin 2025 conference providing the broader market with visibility into the progress of its technology. These steps are part of a wider strategy to establish QBT not only as an R&D leader, but also as a trusted commercial partner within the Bitcoin mining community.\nOther Developments & Legacy Assets\nIn\nJanuary 2025\n, the Company successfully raised \u00a32 million (before expenses) through a placing, ensuring it is well-funded to continue investing in its R&D pipeline, commercialisation activities and, strengthening its balance sheet. These funds have been directed towards expanding the R&D team, procuring specialist hardware and reinforcing operational resilience.\nWith regards to the Sipiem in Fallimento Srl (\u201cSipiem\u201d) legal case, following the 2024 confirmation by the\nVenice\nCourt of Appeal of a judgment in QBT\u2019s favour, enforcement procedures are ongoing against certain of the Sipiem defendants\u2019 assets despite the defendants having lodged an appeal with the Italian Court of Cassation in\nJanuary 2025\n. The Company, however, has not recovered any further material assets at this stage.\nBoard of Directors\nIn\nMay 2025\n, the Company announced with great sadness the passing of\nPeter Fuhrman\n, one of its non-executive directors. Peter\u2019s contribution to QBT and his international experience were highly valued and he will be greatly missed. Following this sad news, the board was pleased to appoint Vladimir Basillo Kusznirczuk as a non-executive director. Vladimir has been QBT\u2019s Marketing and Business Development Manager since 2023 and brings strong commercial experience to the board, enhancing the Company\u2019s business development capabilities.\nFinancial Review\nThe Group reported a total comprehensive loss and operating loss for the period of \u20ac1.5 million (\n30 June 2024\n: loss \u20ac1.3m and loss \u20ac1.1m respectively). There were no charges relating to the recognition of share options within administrative expenses for both periods and no charges for finance costs relating to the revaluation of derivatives.\nAt\n30 June 2025\n, the Group had net liabilities of \u20ac4.5 million, compared to a net liabilities position of \u20ac5.4 million at\n31 December 2024\n. The Group had net current assets of \u20ac3.2m compared to net current assets of \u20ac2.1m at\n31 December 2024\n.\nThe Group\u2019s cash position at the period end was \u20ac1.7m, compared to \u20ac0.6m at\n31 December 2024\n.\nPost\n30 June 2025\nEvents\nThere were no subsequent events of a material nature to report.\nOutlook\nQBT enters the second half of 2025 in a position of growing strength. With live mining tests confirming the efficiency of its AI-driven methods, strategic collaborations underway with ASIC manufacturers and significant industry recognition, the Company is poised to transition from R&D validation to commercialisation.\nThe board remains confident that all of QBT\u2019s assets have the potential to transform the economics of Bitcoin mining by improving performance of SHA-256, the core algorithm for Bitcoin mining. The Company\u2019s commitment to innovation, combined with careful financial management and expanding commercial engagement, positions QBT to become a key enabler of next-generation Bitcoin mining solutions.\nFrancesco Gardin\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies PLC\nCEO and Chairman\nGROUP STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED\n30 JUNE 2025\nNote\nSix months to 30 June 2025\nSix

in\nEngland\nand\nWales\n. The Company\u2019s ordinary shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is First Floor, 1 Chancery Lane,\nLondon, England\n, WC2A 1LF.\nThe principal activity of the Group is that of an investment company with a portfolio of companies primarily encompassing the leisure and real estate sectors mainly in\nItaly\nand, more recently, technology sectors. The focus of management is to pursue the monetisation of all of the Company\u2019s existing assets, through selected realisations, court-led recoveries of misappropriated assets and substantial debt-recovery processes. The Company has also realigned its strategic focus to technology related investments, with special regard to interactive media, blockchain and AI sectors.\n2. Accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the period covered by these consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of preparation\nThe interim financial statements of Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc are unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended\n30 June 2025\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. They include unaudited comparatives for the six months ended\n30 June 2024\ntogether with audited comparatives for the year ended\n31 December 2024\n.\nThe interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended\n31 December 2024\nhave been reported on by the company\u2019s auditors and have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors was qualified in respect of the valuation of the investment in Geosim Systems Ltd. The report of the auditor also contained an emphasis of matter paragraph in respect of a material uncertainty regarding going concern. Aside from the limitation of scope relating to Geosim Systems Ltd, the auditor\u2019s report did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended\n30 June 2025\nhave been prepared on the basis of accounting policies expected to be adopted for the year ended\n31 December 2025\n, which are consistent with the year ended\n31 December 2024\n.\nGoing concern\nThe Group\u2019s activities generated a loss of \u20ac1,537,000 (\nJune 2024\n: \u20ac1,342,000) and had net current assets of \u20ac3,176,000 as at\n30 June 2025\n(\nJune 2024\n: net current assets \u20ac3,809,000). The Group\u2019s operational existence is still dependent on the ability to raise further funding either through an equity placing on AIM, or through other external sources, to support the on-going working capital requirements.\nAfter making due enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group can secure further adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that adequate arrangements will be in place to enable the settlement of their financial commitments, as and when they fall due.\nFor this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the interim accounts. Whilst there are inherent uncertainties in relation to future events, and therefore no certainty over the outcome of the matters described, the Directors consider that, based upon financial projections and dependant on the success of their efforts to complete these activities, the Group will be a going concern for the next twelve months. If it is not possible for the Directors to realise their plans, over which there is significant uncertainty, the carrying value of the assets of the Group is likely to be impaired.\nNotwithstanding the above, the Directors note the material uncertainty in relation to the Group being unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that could affect the Company\u2019s medium-term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the Company\u2019s 2024 Annual Report and Financial Statements, a copy of which is available on the Company\u2019s website:\nwww.quantumblockchaintechnologies.com\n. The key financial risks are liquidity and credit risk.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThe preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in note 3 of the Company\u2019s 2024 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period.\n3. Loss per share\nThe basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the same weighted average number of shares during the period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share options and convertible loans outstanding during the period.\nThe loss and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below:\nSix months to 30 June 2025\nSix months to 30 June 2024\nYear to\n31 December 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\n\u20ac\u2019000\n\u20ac\u2019000\n\u20ac\u2019000\n(Loss)/profit attributable to owners of the parent company:\nBasic earnings\n(1,537)\n(1,342)\n(4,206)\nDiluted earnings\n(1,751)\n(1,136)\n(4,424)\nBasic weighted average number of ordinary shares (000\u2019s)\n1,435,993\n1,291,314\n1,102,309\nDiluted weighted average number of ordinary shares (000\u2019s)\n2,197,383\n2,043,195\n1,727,130\nBasic and fully diluted earnings per share:\nBasic earnings per share\n(\u20ac0.107)\n(\u20ac0.104)\n(\u20ac0.382)\nDiluted earnings per share\n(\u20ac0.080)\n(\u20ac0.056)\n(\u20ac0.256)\nIAS 33 requires presentation of diluted earnings per share when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease earnings per share or increase net loss per share. No adjustment has been made to diluted earnings per share for out-of-the money options and warrants.\n4. Investment Policy\nThe Company invests in the technology sector, with special focus on, but not limited to,\nBlockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptocurrencies and Quantum Computing. As well as making direct investments, the Company may also act as Investment Manager for one or more selected venture capital funds, in compliance with the FCA regulations, which identify, invest in, and acquires companies, assets and projects in the technology sector which show excellent growth potential on a stand-alone basis, and which would add value to the Company\u2019s portfolio of investments.\nThe Company may make investments in target businesses at all stages of development. The majority of investments will be made in unlisted companies, however listed companies may, from time to time, be considered on a selective basis. The geographical focus will be mainly\nEurope\n, but investments may also be considered in other regions to the extent the Board considers that valuable opportunities exist, and positive returns can be achieved.\nThe Board expects that investments will typically be held for the medium to long term, although short term disposal of assets cannot be ruled out. The Company\u2019s investments may range from a minority position with strategic influence to a controlling position. Any transaction constituting a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules will require shareholder approval and the publication by the Company of an admission document meeting the requirements of the AIM Rules.\n5. Copies of Interim Accounts\nCopies of the interim results are available at the Group\u2019s website at\nwww.quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk\n.\nCopies may also be obtained from the Group\u00b4s registered office: Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC, First Floor, 1 Chancery Lane,\nLondon, England\n, WC2A 1LF.",
