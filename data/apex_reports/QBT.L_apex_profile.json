These discussions were focused on the timing for the delivery of both hardware and software from these potential customers and commercial partners. It should be noted that partial access to source code has already been granted to the Company.\nThe Company also held in-depth discussions with other key Bitcoin industry players who were present. These meetings were made possible as QBT is now being perceived and recognised by the industry as a forerunner in the use of AI technology being applied to SHA-256 optimisation, i.e., the core algorithm for Bitcoin mining.\nDuring the same event, the 256 Foundation, whose stated mission is to\n\u201c\nDismantle the proprietary mining empire to make Bitcoin and freedom tech\nnology accessible to anyone\u201d presented a working \u2018open source\u2019 real-time mining system, using three EmberOne hashing boards, comprising 36 ASICs in total.\nThis launch represented the first implementation of a Bitcoin-mining stack, i.e., a complete open software and hardware publicly available design made from the following open-source components:\nHashing board (EmberOne),\nControl board\n(Libre Board),\nFirmware (Mujina), and a\nMining Pool (HydraPool)\nThis is a significant milestone for the Bitcoin industry as it finally opens access for any system designer to assemble a complete mining rig, using an open-source framework which is readily accessible. This differs radically from the current industrial model of existing Bitcoin mining systems which comprises of a closed \u2018black-box\u2019 hardware / software, mainly to protect the products of the rig manufacturers and which has historically delayed the development of the sector, due to the need to reverse engineer existing chips or, by needing to develop an entire hardware / software Bitcoin mining system.\nThe Company, through its US consultants, maintains excellent relations with key 256 Foundation members.\nQBT is, therefore, allocating part of its existing resources to master all elements of the 256 Foundation Bitcoin-mining stack, in order to quickly implement its Methods onto this breakthrough environment, when new mining rigs are launched by system integrators later this year.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \u201cWe are now entering our fourth year of attending US Bitcoin mining events. Bitcoin Park, which we have attended since 2024, provides QBT with the necessary visibility in the sector to all the most important players which represent QBT\u2019s potential future partners and clients.\n\u201cThe central role played by the US Bitcoin community in the development of this growing crypto ecosystem is unique, hence our constant presence at US-based events like this one.\n\u201cQBT\u2019s adoption of the 265 Foundation Bitcoin mining stack as one of the reference development environments for its three Methods adds an additional target platform totally independent from specific manufacturers. While we will continue to work with those ASIC designers and Bitcoin miners in order to develop a collaborative partnership for our Methods, we welcome the 256 Foundation\u2019s open-source attitude as fundamental towards the development of much needed standards for Bitcoin mining-rig development.\u201d\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.

The Company believes that this novel approach, called\nMessage Scheduling For Cryptographic Hashing\n(\u201cMSFCA\u201d), addresses one of the most challenging problems in BTC mining: partial pre-computing of future blockchains\u2019 blocks.\nA patent application in respect of MSFCA has been filed at the UK Intellectual Property Office. If the application is successful, the Company intends to apply for the patent to be extended internationally.\nSUMMARY\nMSFCA can perform pre-calculations for future BTC blocks before the current block is closed\nAllows miners to use less logic gates, thus lower energy costs\nImplementation can be made to QBT\u2019s current SHA-256 architecture with feasible modifications\nEffective potential area saving is around 8%\nBACKGROUND\nApproximately every ten minutes a block is added to the BTC blockchain. Each new block represents the confirmation of the validity of the encrypted transactions, i.e. transfer of BTCs between senders and receivers, usually between, on average, 2,000 and 3,000. The miner who finds the winning hash for the block within ten minutes, causes the block to be closed and receives the reward; currently 6.25 BTCs, plus the transaction fees. A new block in the following ten minutes can then start to be processed, but only when the previous block has been closed, because the starting information to compute the new blocks, contains information from the previous closed block.\nMSFCA\nThe computational optimisation obtained by MSFCA allows, under BTC mining special conditions, the miner to asynchronously perform (i.e. not within the temporal boundaries of the current block being computed\n)\npartial pre-computations of future blocks, before the ten minute computation \u2018time target\u2019 for closing a new block begins. The benefit being that all the logical gates and computation time on the ASIC chip needed for the specific partial pre-computation are saved.\nQBT believes this is a novel procedure, potentially capable, in certain conditions, of addressing a key BTC mining limitation that prevents asynchronous pre-computation of a new block in the blockchain prior to the previous block being\nclosed.\nApplication of MSFCA is not believed to enhance SHA-256\u2019s computation performance time; however, by enabling partial SHA-256 pre-processing of the block, it makes it possible to save the hardware resources otherwise necessary for standard SHA-256 computation. From this perspective, it is anticipated that energy would be saved due to less logic gates being present on the ASIC allowing the same chip area to be used to implement additional SHA-256 engines and increasing the overall speed of the process.\nThe key principle of this approach is that the partial pre-computation can occur asynchronously. Implementation of MSFCA will require a specific ASIC architecture, hence a specific ASIC chip will need to be designed, however the Company believes this would only require a feasible modification of the current SHA-256 proprietary implementation being developed by QBT.\nIn terms of SHA-256 ASIC chip areas, the projected potential saving would be in the region of 25% for one instance of SHA256\nout of the three instances involved in Bitcoin mining. However, because of other well-known optimisation techniques, the effective\npotential area saving of MSFCA is estimated by the Company\u2019s ASIC designer to be around 8% on average.\nThe handling of pre-processed data requires additional circuitry, the impact of which is expected to be negligible in the near future.\nWhile MSFCA can be implemented with currently available technology, by adding a logical gate overhead, in the near future, the Company believes these overheads will be less relevant, making this approach even more competitive.\nDespite\npresent technological\nlimitations, (for example, the limited throughput of memory chips), the Company believes that it is strategically important to file a patent application covering the novel approach created through the use of MSFCA.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman commented\n:\n\u201c\nWhile at this juncture we cannot go into the specific details of what we believe is an innovative solution designed by our R&D cryptography team, suffice it to say\nthat the new concept behind this idea disrupts, under special conditions, a fundamental BTC blockchain paradigm; computation for future blocks can take place before the previous block is mined. This is quite a radical change of the paradigm, and we believe it is well worth a patent ap"

This typically entails these parties providing QBT with a number of the most commonly used mining rigs available in the market for the Company to study and implement the porting of its Method A and Method B chip enhancements.\nThe Company is targeting not only Intel\u2019s Blockscale based miners, but also the most popular mining rigs produced in\nChina\n, which are used by more than 75% of the global Bitcoin market\n(1}\n. However, due to lack of publicly available technical documents concerning the mining machines produced by\nAsia\n-based manufacturers, the Company has been faced with a very challenging software engineering project. Nonetheless, through the partial redesign of Method B, the Company can start porting on the equipment made by the largest mining rig manufacturer in that region. The Company\u2019s R&D Machine Learning team has been able to quickly modify Method B while retaining the entirety of its performance enhancements, as confirmed through internal testing undertaken by the R&D team. QBT expects that this encouraging result will (once the porting of Method B on the mining rig firmware has been completed), allow the Company to pursue commercial arrangements for the deployment of QBT\u2019s methods in the mining hardware market segment.\nAs a result, the Company is looking to engage with potential partners to deploy Method B in Chinese produced mining rigs, which currently represent over 75%\n{1}\nof all operational machines in the Bitcoin mining industry. In monetary terms, at the current overall hashing power of the Bitcoin network, this represents more than 2.5 million miners\n{2}\n, costing an estimated\nUSD 5 billion\nat an average cost of\nUSD 2,000\nper mining rig.\nInstalling QBT\u2019s Method B on Chinese manufactured rigs is anticipated to increase the success rate of the mining probability of these machines by 2.6 times. Because of the intrinsic nature of Method B, in order to achieve the same mining success rate a mining enterprise would have to increase its hashing power by 50%. QBT believes, therefore, that employing Method B QBT believes this could provide meaningful cost savings to the whole bitcoin mining industry, in terms of reduced aggregate capital expenditure. Furthermore, increasing the hashing power, via Method B\u2019s software, without adding new miners could represent a major energy saving.\nFurther announcements in relation to the porting of Method B on Asian manufactured mining rigs will be made in due course.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman of QBT commented:\n\u201c\nQBT has now entered into the engineering phase of its first two products: Method A which our laboratory tests show an increase in the mining performance by nearly 10% and Method B, which increase the mining probability by 2.6 times. The overall response from the North American miners has been encouraging ; by increasing the hashing power, without increasing CAPEX could, in their view, be a game-changer, especially in the current market, where the price of Bitcoin has fallen below\n$30,000\nand with the next \u2019halving\u2019 expected in about nine months.\n\u201c\nThe Company, therefore, is focusing its main efforts on speeding up the porting process of both Method A and B\nin order to reach commerciality.\u201d\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman\n+39 335 296573\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJeff Keating\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nKasia Brzozowska\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nAbout\nQuantum\nBlockchain\nTechnologies\nPlc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is an AIM listed investment company with a strategic focus on Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Artificial Intelligence.
