These discussions were focused on the timing for the delivery of both hardware and software from these potential customers and commercial partners. It should be noted that partial access to source code has already been granted to the Company.\nThe Company also held in-depth discussions with other key Bitcoin industry players who were present. These meetings were made possible as QBT is now being perceived and recognised by the industry as a forerunner in the use of AI technology being applied to SHA-256 optimisation, i.e., the core algorithm for Bitcoin mining.\nDuring the same event, the 256 Foundation, whose stated mission is to\n\u201c\nDismantle the proprietary mining empire to make Bitcoin and freedom tech\nnology accessible to anyone\u201d presented a working \u2018open source\u2019 real-time mining system, using three EmberOne hashing boards, comprising 36 ASICs in total.\nThis launch represented the first implementation of a Bitcoin-mining stack, i.e., a complete open software and hardware publicly available design made from the following open-source components:\nHashing board (EmberOne),\nControl board\n(Libre Board),\nFirmware (Mujina), and a\nMining Pool (HydraPool)\nThis is a significant milestone for the Bitcoin industry as it finally opens access for any system designer to assemble a complete mining rig, using an open-source framework which is readily accessible. This differs radically from the current industrial model of existing Bitcoin mining systems which comprises of a closed \u2018black-box\u2019 hardware / software, mainly to protect the products of the rig manufacturers and which has historically delayed the development of the sector, due to the need to reverse engineer existing chips or, by needing to develop an entire hardware / software Bitcoin mining system.\nThe Company, through its US consultants, maintains excellent relations with key 256 Foundation members.\nQBT is, therefore, allocating part of its existing resources to master all elements of the 256 Foundation Bitcoin-mining stack, in order to quickly implement its Methods onto this breakthrough environment, when new mining rigs are launched by system integrators later this year.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \u201cWe are now entering our fourth year of attending US Bitcoin mining events. Bitcoin Park, which we have attended since 2024, provides QBT with the necessary visibility in the sector to all the most important players which represent QBT\u2019s potential future partners and clients.\n\u201cThe central role played by the US Bitcoin community in the development of this growing crypto ecosystem is unique, hence our constant presence at US-based events like this one.\n\u201cQBT\u2019s adoption of the 265 Foundation Bitcoin mining stack as one of the reference development environments for its three Methods adds an additional target platform totally independent from specific manufacturers. While we will continue to work with those ASIC designers and Bitcoin miners in order to develop a collaborative partnership for our Methods, we welcome the 256 Foundation\u2019s open-source attitude as fundamental towards the development of much needed standards for Bitcoin mining-rig development.\u201d\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.

The Company believes that this novel approach, called\nMessage Scheduling For Cryptographic Hashing\n(\u201cMSFCA\u201d), addresses one of the most challenging problems in BTC mining: partial pre-computing of future blockchains\u2019 blocks.\nA patent application in respect of MSFCA has been filed at the UK Intellectual Property Office. If the application is successful, the Company intends to apply for the patent to be extended internationally.\nSUMMARY\nMSFCA can perform pre-calculations for future BTC blocks before the current block is closed\nAllows miners to use less logic gates, thus lower energy costs\nImplementation can be made to QBT\u2019s current SHA-256 architecture with feasible modifications\nEffective potential area saving is around 8%\nBACKGROUND\nApproximately every ten minutes a block is added to the BTC blockchain. Each new block represents the confirmation of the validity of the encrypted transactions, i.e. transfer of BTCs between senders and receivers, usually between, on average, 2,000 and 3,000. The miner who finds the winning hash for the block within ten minutes, causes the block to be closed and receives the reward; currently 6.25 BTCs, plus the transaction fees. A new block in the following ten minutes can then start to be processed, but only when the previous block has been closed, because the starting information to compute the new blocks, contains information from the previous closed block.\nMSFCA\nThe computational optimisation obtained by MSFCA allows, under BTC mining special conditions, the miner to asynchronously perform (i.e. not within the temporal boundaries of the current block being computed\n)\npartial pre-computations of future blocks, before the ten minute computation \u2018time target\u2019 for closing a new block begins. The benefit being that all the logical gates and computation time on the ASIC chip needed for the specific partial pre-computation are saved.\nQBT believes this is a novel procedure, potentially capable, in certain conditions, of addressing a key BTC mining limitation that prevents asynchronous pre-computation of a new block in the blockchain prior to the previous block being\nclosed.\nApplication of MSFCA is not believed to enhance SHA-256\u2019s computation performance time; however, by enabling partial SHA-256 pre-processing of the block, it makes it possible to save the hardware resources otherwise necessary for standard SHA-256 computation. From this perspective, it is anticipated that energy would be saved due to less logic gates being present on the ASIC allowing the same chip area to be used to implement additional SHA-256 engines and increasing the overall speed of the process.\nThe key principle of this approach is that the partial pre-computation can occur asynchronously. Implementation of MSFCA will require a specific ASIC architecture, hence a specific ASIC chip will need to be designed, however the Company believes this would only require a feasible modification of the current SHA-256 proprietary implementation being developed by QBT.\nIn terms of SHA-256 ASIC chip areas, the projected potential saving would be in the region of 25% for one instance of SHA256\nout of the three instances involved in Bitcoin mining. However, because of other well-known optimisation techniques, the effective\npotential area saving of MSFCA is estimated by the Company\u2019s ASIC designer to be around 8% on average.\nThe handling of pre-processed data requires additional circuitry, the impact of which is expected to be negligible in the near future.\nWhile MSFCA can be implemented with currently available technology, by adding a logical gate overhead, in the near future, the Company believes these overheads will be less relevant, making this approach even more competitive.\nDespite\npresent technological\nlimitations, (for example, the limited throughput of memory chips), the Company believes that it is strategically important to file a patent application covering the novel approach created through the use of MSFCA.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman commented\n:\n\u201c\nWhile at this juncture we cannot go into the specific details of what we believe is an innovative solution designed by our R&D cryptography team, suffice it to say\nthat the new concept behind this idea disrupts, under special conditions, a fundamental BTC blockchain paradigm; computation for future blocks can take place before the previous block is mined. This is quite a radical change of the paradigm, and we believe it is well worth a patent ap"

This typically entails these parties providing QBT with a number of the most commonly used mining rigs available in the market for the Company to study and implement the porting of its Method A and Method B chip enhancements.\nThe Company is targeting not only Intel\u2019s Blockscale based miners, but also the most popular mining rigs produced in\nChina\n, which are used by more than 75% of the global Bitcoin market\n(1}\n. However, due to lack of publicly available technical documents concerning the mining machines produced by\nAsia\n-based manufacturers, the Company has been faced with a very challenging software engineering project. Nonetheless, through the partial redesign of Method B, the Company can start porting on the equipment made by the largest mining rig manufacturer in that region. The Company\u2019s R&D Machine Learning team has been able to quickly modify Method B while retaining the entirety of its performance enhancements, as confirmed through internal testing undertaken by the R&D team. QBT expects that this encouraging result will (once the porting of Method B on the mining rig firmware has been completed), allow the Company to pursue commercial arrangements for the deployment of QBT\u2019s methods in the mining hardware market segment.\nAs a result, the Company is looking to engage with potential partners to deploy Method B in Chinese produced mining rigs, which currently represent over 75%\n{1}\nof all operational machines in the Bitcoin mining industry. In monetary terms, at the current overall hashing power of the Bitcoin network, this represents more than 2.5 million miners\n{2}\n, costing an estimated\nUSD 5 billion\nat an average cost of\nUSD 2,000\nper mining rig.\nInstalling QBT\u2019s Method B on Chinese manufactured rigs is anticipated to increase the success rate of the mining probability of these machines by 2.6 times. Because of the intrinsic nature of Method B, in order to achieve the same mining success rate a mining enterprise would have to increase its hashing power by 50%. QBT believes, therefore, that employing Method B QBT believes this could provide meaningful cost savings to the whole bitcoin mining industry, in terms of reduced aggregate capital expenditure. Furthermore, increasing the hashing power, via Method B\u2019s software, without adding new miners could represent a major energy saving.\nFurther announcements in relation to the porting of Method B on Asian manufactured mining rigs will be made in due course.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman of QBT commented:\n\u201c\nQBT has now entered into the engineering phase of its first two products: Method A which our laboratory tests show an increase in the mining performance by nearly 10% and Method B, which increase the mining probability by 2.6 times. The overall response from the North American miners has been encouraging ; by increasing the hashing power, without increasing CAPEX could, in their view, be a game-changer, especially in the current market, where the price of Bitcoin has fallen below\n$30,000\nand with the next \u2019halving\u2019 expected in about nine months.\n\u201c\nThe Company, therefore, is focusing its main efforts on speeding up the porting process of both Method A and B\nin order to reach commerciality.\u201d\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman\n+39 335 296573\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJeff Keating\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nKasia Brzozowska\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nAbout\nQuantum\nBlockchain\nTechnologies\nPlc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is an AIM listed investment company with a strategic focus on Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Artificial Intelligence.

CL2017 is now seeking recovery of these funds from the insurance company.\nAs announced on 16 May 2024, CL2017 had reached an agreement with some of the Sipiem defendants who were liable for a portion of the judgment, approximately \u20ac1.1million, to settle for\n\u20ac700,000. However, that settlement was subject to appeals court approval which was not received for technical legal reasons. Accordingly, CL2017 is now seeking to recover the outstanding \u20ac500,000 (being the difference between the settlement and judgment amounts above plus interest and further compensation for inflation loss over time) from these defendants. Towards this,\nenforcement action has been started in respect of properties owned by these defendants.\nThe defendants appealed in January 2025 to Italy\u2019s highest court in Rome against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. Despite this appeal, while it remains pending, CL2017 continues to have full legal authority to recover the entire \u20ac6 million plus interest and further compensation for inflation loss over time , less the \u20ac700,000 in settlement funds received from certain of the defendants (as announced on 16 May 2024 and as described above) and several tens of thousands of funds confiscated from the bank accounts of certain defendants.\nFurther to these recovery efforts, CL2017 has recently confiscated two real property assets valued by a surveyor in excess of \u20ac600,000. A third real property asset has been identified by CL2017 and a confiscation request has been duly filed.\nSimilarly, further enforcement actions have been, and will be, started against\nproperties belonging to the defendant\ns\nwho have already paid the above-mentioned \u20ac700,000\n. The two real properties mentioned above are set for auction on a date to be ordered shortly by a judge in Biella (the province where the properties are located).\nIn addition to the real property seizures, chattel assets owned by certain defendants have been confiscated, including approximately 20 items of artwork. CL2017 will obtain a valuation from an art expert as soon as practical.\nThe liquidation of these chattel assets will be carried out in accordance with Italian civil law procedure.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \u201cThe determination to collect the awarded damages is steadfast and will continue by CL2017 undeterred.\nThese efforts will continue until such time as the judgment is fully and finally satisfied or until CL2017 is confident that no more funds and assets are in the possession of any of the Sipiem defendants. All recovery action legally possible under Italian Civil Law has been, is and will be pursued by CL2017 for as long as it takes.\u201d\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.

As a result of these activities, QBT has entered into three non-disclosure agreements (\"NDA\") with three separate ASIC manufacturers, each of which has developed its own Bitcoin mining rig.\nThe process has reached the stage where these three companies will now be needing to make their mining rigs available to QBT's testing team at its laboratory in Milan, with access to their relevant source code. This will allow QBT to install the\nsoftware\nversion of Method C AI Oracle, the launch of which was announced on 12 November 2025, onto the third-party mining rigs. This will be the first step to allow each miner to assess the performance of the higher quality hashing rate provided by Method C.\nJoint analysis of the\nhardware\nversion of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new\nsoftware\nversion, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach.\nTherefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\nQBT has also recently signed an NDA with an innovative Bitcoin mining pool, where the goal is to enable the nodes of the pool to help miners generate better quality hash rates, leading to more Bitcoin being mined, which has been the main focus of QBT's R&D programme. While this represents a further development challenge for the R&D team behind Method C, it could potentially open up the possibility of bypassing the need to modify the operating system of all the mining rigs using the pool. New training data sets for the software version of Method C learning models are currently being analysed for this purpose.\nRegarding QBT's patent applications, the Company is working alongside its patent lawyers with patent examiners in Europe and the US to respond to these examiners' queries and objections. This is standard procedure for most patent applications, and the Company remains optimistic that it will see positive results.\nFinally, QBT is collaborating with a small startup which designs mining solutions around the Blockscale Intel ASIC. The two companies are conducting experiments on a wide variety of SHA-256 implementations from different manufacturers to determine the validity of the Company's three Methods: A, B and C in this specific environment.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman, commented\n, \"The Company is now engaged with the ASIC manufacturers it has been targeting over the past year. The Board believe QBT's technology proposition is unique within the Bitcoin industry, which is the main reason why there is such a high level of interest from mining companies assessing our technology. We firmly believe that the potential commercial advantage our Methods could bring to their mining rigs is an unprecedented and compelling technological proposition.\n\"As with any R&D focused business, we continue to develop and refine our Methods, with ongoing investments in personnel and equipment. Although it has taken time, we are now seeing the results of the frequent meetings we have held with the ASIC manufacturers, and we believe we have begun to develop a high level of trust with these companies; the first step to forging a strong collaborative partnership.\"\n-ends-\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc",

The primary goal of the R&D programme is to develop Bitcoin mining tools and techniques, via its technology-driven approach, which the Company believes will significantly outperform existing market practices.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nI am pleased to present the Group\u2019s Interim Report for the first half of 2025, a period that has further strengthened Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 position as an innovator in the Bitcoin mining technology sector. Building on the achievements reported in and for 2024, the Company has continued to advance its research & development (\u201cR&D\u201d) programme, file new patents and deepen its engagement with potential strategic commercial partners, especially in\nNorth America\n. These developments further reinforce QBT\u2019s ambition to commercialise its disruptive technologies and secure a strong foothold in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\nTechnological and R&D Progress\nDuring the first half of 2025, Method C AI Oracle continued to be the centrepiece of QBT\u2019s innovation strategy. In January, the Company filed a patent application entitled \u201cImplementation of Binary Decision Trees\u201d, protecting the hardware implementation of Method C. This followed successful field-programmable gate array (\u201cFPGA\u201d) - based testing and the confirmation that Method C is able to deliver up to 30% improvement in mining efficiency on live Bitcoin blocks, either by reducing energy consumption or accelerating hash rates.\nQBT is currently collaborating with leading ASIC manufacturers to evaluate the implementation of the AI Oracle directly onto their chip architecture. Such a milestone could pave the way for licensing opportunities and long-term strategic partnerships.\nIn parallel, porting of Methods A and B (the Company\u2019s machine learning-driven optimisation techniques) onto Bitcoin mining rigs continued. QBT\u2019s implementation onto ESP-miner has been completed and live ASIC chip cryptocurrency mining commenced in the Company\u2019s\nMilan\nlaboratory. In\nJune 2025\n, QBT announced ongoing discussions with aftermarket control board providers to integrate these methods, which the board believes could allow rapid market penetration through existing miners worldwide.\nFurther, QBT\u2019s broader R&D pipeline remains active, with patent applications for ASIC UltraBoost and ASIC EnhancedBoost remaining pending, and a prototype design for an in-house ASIC mining chip preserved for potential future deployment. These initiatives collectively strengthen QBT\u2019s intellectual property base and broaden the commercialisation avenues available to the Company.\nCommercial Engagement and Industry Presence\nQBT has actively sought to align its R&D breakthroughs with commercial opportunities. In the first half of 2025, the Company presented to potential customers at the Mining Disrupt 2025 conference in\nFlorida\n, Bitcoin 2025 Las Vegas and Bitcoin Park in\nNashville\n, where Method C\u2019s AI Oracle attracted significant attention from leading ASIC manufacturers, mining pools and large-scale miners. These demonstrations have already led, for all three Methods, to follow-up discussions with third-parties, under non-disclosure agreements, underscoring the industry\u2019s growing recognition of QBT\u2019s disruptive technology.\nThe Company also launched a video presentation of the AI Oracle at the Bitcoin 2025 conference providing the broader market with visibility into the progress of its technology. These steps are part of a wider strategy to establish QBT not only as an R&D leader, but also as a trusted commercial partner within the Bitcoin mining community.\nOther Developments & Legacy Assets\nIn\nJanuary 2025\n, the Company successfully raised \u00a32 million (before expenses) through a placing, ensuring it is well-funded to continue investing in its R&D pipeline, commercialisation activities and, s",

          "full_content": "19 Jun 2025 09:50\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc - Business Update\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc - Business Update\nPR Newswire\nLONDON, United Kingdom, June 19\n19 June 2025\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies plc\n(\"QBT\" or \"the Company\")\nBusiness Update\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), a Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the blockchain technology sector announces that following its attendance at Bitcoin 2025 conference in\nLas Vegas\n, where it presented its AI technology for Bitcoin mining to selected potential partners and customers, that it is now engaged in discussions with two companies to port its Method A and Method B AI technologies onto their existing aftermarket control boards. This segment of the market represents a significant user base and provides, the Board believes, the quickest route to market for two of QBT's software products.\nAs previously reported, the Company confidently believes its three Methods (namely Method A, Method B and Method C) represent a breakthrough achievement in the industry and, in\nLas Vegas\n, the Company demonstrated compelling evidence that using its proprietary AI to increase the quality hashing performance was a reality. In one example, for Method A, this was accomplished by running two identical ASIC miners, in real-time mining mode, with the same clock frequency and thermal conditions; one mining with its native GCminer operating system and one with a modified CGminer, which included QBT AI software. The results clearly showed that using QBT AI software resulted in producing more pool rewards per unit of time.\nDeploying Method A and Method B on existing mining platforms\nAfter careful review of the market's needs, QBT is focused on working with companies who deploy aftermarket control boards on their Bitcoin miners. These boards often replace the manufacturer's original control boards installed in any typical mining rig, especially in the market leading mining machines predominantly manufactured by Chinese companies. The reason for aftermarket optimisation is due to the improvement of the mining performance of the ASIC, the size of the processing engine of the mining rigs, which is achieved by physically optimising the hash rate and the energy costs, by overclocking, reducing voltage, monitoring the ASIC temperature, and a number of other efficiencies. In the Bitcoin mining sector, less than ten companies have undertaken the cost and effort to redesign the firmware of the control boards, as it represents a substantial investment.\nTherefore, due to widespread standard practice of optimising control boards, implementing the porting of QBT's CGminer and ESPminer software modifications onto aftermarket control boards does not represent a technical barrier, since the small changes required to both the operating system software and the core firmware can be simply implemented by aftermarket control board suppliers under QBT specifications.\nThe Company's technical team believes that uploading QBT's modified firmware and software to aftermarket control boards would be a seamless upgrade, similar to what is normally and routinely performed by the provider of such aftermarket boards when updating their current versions of their software and firmware.\nThe Board believes this commercial direction will allow the immediate release and sale of Methods A and B, while a live connection to QBT's servers running QBT's AI learning models is anticipated to guarantee control of the use of the Methods by the customers.\nQBT will, therefore, look to deploy its technology in partnership with the aftermarket control board providers mainly on miners produced by the leading Chinese mining rig manufacturers where tens of thousands of aftermarket control boards are currently installed. This segment of the Bitcoin mining market represents the largest share of machines currently in use, in addition it comprises the new US mining rig producers, all of whom attended Bitcoin 2025.\nMethod C - Design integration\nThe Board is also pleased to report that QBT is now engaged with two ASIC chip manufacturers, both of whom will shortly commence an in-depth assessment of Method C and its architectural implementation integration within the existing design of their own ASICs, new versions of which are currently under development.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman of QBT, commented\n: \"The Company is finally entering into the on-site third-party assessment phase with potential customers and partners. The live and off-line demonstrations of QBT's technology in\nLas Vegas\nproved to be essential in convincing some of the major players that the ability to make predictions on the behavior of SHA-256 using AI learning models is indeed, real, as it provides a practical solution to improve the quality hashing power of a miner.\"\n\"We are now moving fast from the single ASIC implementations of Method A and Method B to the mining rig versions in order",

This work has been restricted by the severe limitations caused by the way SHA-256 is implemented on the most widely used Bitcoin mining ASIC chips.\nThe QBT Client version of Method B implemented initially onto the CGminer operating system has, as previously reported, now been ported onto the ESPminer operating system. This change meant that the Company was able to commence real-time mining testing using Bitaxe, an open hardware and software project which makes Bitcoin miners available using between one and six ASIC chips from the largest manufacturer of such devices. Specifically, the hardware used by the R&D team are the BM1362, BM1366 and BM1368 ASIC processors.\nAs a result of the R&D team's deep understanding of CGminer, the implementation of the QBT Client under the ESPminer operating system environment was completed in\nDecember 2024\n. The very recent acquisition of the Bitaxe Gamma model using the BM1370 ASIC, the same chip used in the latest version of the most powerful Bitcoin mining rigs available on the market, has opened up the possibility of developing the original version of Method B. The Company believes that this is a significant development as the original version of Method B (as announced on\n10 May 2023\n) potentially achieved (in lab tests) the best mining advantage against standard mining rigs.\nConsistency checks between the data generated by the BM1370 ASIC and past lab results are being undertaken before modifying the mining rigs' CGminer operating systems so as to allow the installation of the QBT Client version of Method B.\nThe Company is currently considering its additional hardware choices for the deployment of Method B as there are a number of viable options available in addition to BM1370 ASIC. One such chip would be Intel's BZM2 chip although there are very limited numbers available due to the chip no longer being in production. A U.S. company, Block, Inc. has announced the release of a prototype ASIC chip which QBT believes could be suitable.\nRegarding Method A, it is currently mining live in QBT's\nMilan\n-based lab in single chip mode, using commercial ASICs for Bitcoin mining connected to an existing mining pool. Operational performance of Method A is currently being assessed based on the hash rate and measured by the pool and the corresponding rewards awarded, comparing one ASIC chip running with Method A and one without. Further development work is to be conducted by the R&D team to finalise a multiple ASIC chip version which can be ported by QBT's software engineers onto existing miners manufactured by the dominant players within this sector.\nPatent Applications\nThe current status of the first two filed patent applications (\"Asic UltraBoost\" and \"Asic EnhancedBoost\") is still pending, with the normal interactions between the European Patent Office examiners and the Company. The third patent application (\"Implementation of Binary Decision Tree\") has been recently filed with the UK patent office, as reported on\n15 January 2025\n.\nThe quantum computing version of SHA-256 implementation is still being held in draft form with the Company's patent attorney, with filing with the UK patent office now expected within the next few months. This is because the Company gave filing priority to the Binary Decision Tree application supporting Method C hardware implementation.\nQBT proprietary ASIC chip\nOn\n13 March 2024\n, the Company announced an update about its efforts to develop a prototype version of an in-house proprietary ASIC chip using large scale integration for demo purposes. In the last few months, this internal project has been put on hold to enable the focus of the design team to be temporarily redirected to support the R&D AI teams, in particular Method C's AI Oracle project.\nMeanwhile, a basic ASIC chip for Bitcoin mining design architecture which includes the improvements of the first patent application remains available as a QBT asset, which the Company, under the right circumstances and with the right partner, could develop into a product, also hosting the Method C AI Oracle.\nSipiem In Liquidazione Spa (\"Sipiem\") litigation\nIn\nJanuary 2025\n, the defendants in the Company subsidiary Clear Leisure 2017 Ltd's (\"CL2017\") lawsuit against the former directors and members of",

The material competitive advantage in mining enabled by the AI Oracle may be achieved either by (i) reducing the energy cost of mining by approximately 30%; or (ii), accelerating the mining speed at current energy consumption and costs with approximately a 30% greater hash rate.\nMethod C AI Oracle \u2013 Performance and Implementation\nThe AI Oracle achieves these material advantages through being able to predict the likelihood of an input to SHA-256 to produce a winning hash above a certain level of difficulty. Should the AI Oracle calculate that the current SHA-256 input will not be successful in finding the winning hash, it skips that calculation and moves on to the next input. In the Company\u2019s announcement of\n24 October 2024\n, it reported that irrelevant (or non-winning) SHA-256 computations were being avoided almost 50% of the time, but that performance result was obtained through lab tests simulating historic mining blocks,\ni.e\n., not real-time mining on the current blocks of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nT\nhe Company has now \u201cretrained\u201d the AI Oracle to operate on current blocks of the bitcoin blockchain and it has completed work on a Field Programmable Gate Array (\u201cFPGA\u201d) implementation of the AI Oracle, as per the patent application filed by the Company (see announcement dated\n15 January 2025\n:\u201cI\nmplementation of Binary Decision Trees\n\u201d) which is now mining\ncurrent\nBitcoin blockchain blocks and avoiding irrelevant SHA-256 computations approximately 30% of the time.\nAs a result of this improvement, QBT\u2019s proprietary logic gate architecture implementation of AI Oracle has commenced mining in real-time with a Bitcoin mining pool, which is already demonstrating quantitative material advantages compared to the same real-time hardware mining without AI Oracle.\nAs the Company is deploying AI Oracle on limited hardware resources available to the Company at this time (\ni.e\n., an FPGA chip), the pool mined shares of Bitcoin are comparatively minimal but the same FPGA chip with the AI Oracle results in an approximate 30% advantage over an FPGA chip without the AI Oracle version.\nIn other words, had the AI Oracle been implemented on ASIC chips, the Company believes it would boost an ASIC chip\u2019s mining performance by approximately 30%. As of today, QBT is using an FPGA, which has the hashing power of a very small fraction of an ASIC, but is still showing an approximately 30% improvement which is the Company\u2019s key goal, mainly for validation and demonstrative purposes.\nFollowing the filing of its new patent application referred to above, the Company is now in a position to demonstrate its FPGA-based live Bitcoin mining, via a mining pool, to potential clients who it anticipates primarily will be hardware manufacturers.\nThe board of directors currently believes that working in commercial partnership with a major hardware manufacturer via a licensing agreement, will be the most logical route to market, principally due to the cost benefits to QBT when transferring its disruptive technology from an FPGA to the most competitive ASIC in the market.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented,\n\u201cFollowing almost three years of R&D efforts, the AI team working on Method C has delivered its first irrefutable result, with a new version of Method C AI Oracle, which can now be used to mine the current blockchain blocks in real-time with an approximate 30% improved performance. This has been made possible thanks to retraining the Method C model and to a very efficient hardware implementation of the AI Oracle, which forms the core of the \u201cI\nmplementation of Binary Decision Trees\u201d\npatent application.\n\u201cWe believe this has the potential to be a major breakthrough for the entire Bitcoin mining industry, ",

The same percentage applies also to energy consumption,\ni.e.,\nthe energy costs to run the AI Oracle represents an additional ~1% - 4% of the energy consumed by the miner performed by an ASIC without the AI Oracle.\nThe above figures represent an almost irrelevant overhead when compared to the double SHA-256 percentage of avoided computations, determined by the AI Oracle.\nAs QBT owns the Intellectual Property (\u201cIP\u201d) for the AI Oracle implementation,\ni.e\n., the logic gates architecture for the ASIC design, the Company will now look to implement a relevant commercial strategy, using its new IP, to monetise this proprietary asset.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \u201cThe key requirements included in the specification of the on-chip implementation of the AI Oracle, are the limited area to be used, the low energy consumption and the processing speed. We have determined that the AI Oracle will not affect the performance of any given SHA-256 architecture of an ASIC chip. All three requirements have been met by our FPGA/ASIC design team. This has been an outstanding result for the team and QBT. Moreover, the AI Oracle implementation overhead between approximately 1% and 4% of a double SHA-256 lane, is an extremely impressive result.\n\u201cWhile the patent application is meant to protect these innovative applications of the AI Oracle implementation, the core technology for the generation of the Oracle,\ni.e.\n, parameters to build the AI Oracle generated by the Machine Learning Model C have been kept separate as these represent an asset for the Company which it intends to protect as an industrial secret.\u201d\n-ends-\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman\n+39 335 296573\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJeff Keating\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is an AIM listed investment company with a strategic focus on technology related investments, including a special regard towards Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and AI sectors.

While the Machine Learning model has previously been defined as Method C, the result of its `training' with relevant data is known in the industry as an AI Oracle. This Oracle is being used by QBT to implement its prediction engine.\nMethod C's AI Oracle is able to predict the likelihood of an input to SHA-256 (the core algorithm to mine Bitcoins) to produce a winning Hash. Should the AI Oracle calculate that the current SHA-256 will not be successful in finding the winning Hash, it skips that calculation and moves on to the next input. In the\nMarch 2024\nannouncement, the Company reported that irrelevant SHA-256 computations were being avoided almost 30% of the time.\nIt was further reported on\n15 August 2024\nthat, following further testing, the AI Oracle was performing real-time simulated mining, at historic lower mining difficulty levels, for the purpose of industry demonstrations.\nThe Company is now able to report that at a lower level of mining difficulty, the performance of the AI Oracle generated by Method C, used at the mining rig level, has been materially improved from 30% to more than 50%. Simply stated, this means that on an average of 100 inputs to SHA-256, more than 50 of them are assessed as not worth being calculated, since no winning hashes will be generated from those inputs.\nThe Company believes this is a major innovation, which undermines a key Bitcoin Mining industry assumption that the SHA-256 algorithm output cannot be predicted. The implications are, therefore, significant in that a Bitcoin miner operating with the AI Oracle at a lower level of difficulty than the current one, would be able to:\n\u00b7\nDouble the mining rate in the same time period, and\n\u00b7\nKeep energy costs at the same level.\nWhile the Company is now finally able to demonstrate the above achievements in real time simulated mining, using QBT's AI Oracle hardware implementation (see below) and a simulation of the blockchain using historic data, it has to be noted that recent lab tests have also clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the AI Oracle, as a result of the training of the Method C model, running at the\ncurrent\nlevel of mining difficulty.\nFrom a commercial perspective, QBT's vigorous testing has demonstrated that the performance of the AI Oracle on a single mining rig at a lower level of mining difficulty is such that more than 50% of the inputs to SHA-256 are discarded, without affecting the chance of the miner to find a winning Hash.\nDetailed measurements of global efficiency for the AI Oracle generated by Method C are currently in progress so QBT can benchmark the improvements against existing mining devices operating at current levels of mining difficulty using key industry parameters, such as, energy saving and improved hashing power (Joule per\nTera Hash\n).\nThe Company is now focused on two elements which are key to producing a commercial version of AI Oracle generated by Method C.\nFirstly, it is investigating a route to maintain the AI Oracle's success at current and future mining difficulty levels, and secondly, the QBT Machine Learning team is working on producing a software-only version of the AI Oracle generated by Method C, that can be used by mining pools.\nMethod C - Hardware Implementation of the AI Oracle generated by Method C\nThe Board recognises that a commercial product is key to the future success of the Company, and it can report it has now taken a major step forward with the development of a real-time hardware implementation for the AI Oracle, which QBT sees as being both innovative and efficient.\nThe Company will be in a position to provide further details of this technical solution once it has filed a patent application",

The primary goal of the R&D programme is to develop Bitcoin mining tools and techniques, via its technology-driven approach, which the Company believes will significantly outperform existing market practices.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDuring the first half of 2024, QBT continued to focus its efforts on developing the first commercial Bitcoin mining products and services that utilises its intensive R&D programme.\nR&D\nThe R&D programme has achieved several positive milestones so far:\n-\nAsic UltraBoost:\nDesigned to improve Bitcoin mining by eliminating redundant computations in a key part of the mining algorithm, resulting in faster and more efficient operations. A patent application has been filed with patent offices in the UK and the EU (which also covers the UK), as well as the\nUSA\n,\nCanada\n,\nAustralia\nand\nSouth Korea\n.\n-\nAsic Enhanced Boost\n: An optimised approach to SHA-256 computation for Bitcoin mining that enables partial pre-computation of future blockchain blocks. A patent application has also been submitted to the UK and EU patent offices.\n-\nQuantum Mining\n: A quantum version of the Bitcoin mining algorithm that utilises qubit-based quantum computation and quantum logic gates. A patent application for this is being drafted and expected to be filed as soon as practicable in jurisdictions to be determined.\n-\nMethod A\n: A Machine Learning (\u201cML\u201d) based approach aimed at reducing the SHA-256 search space compared to the brute-force method used in Bitcoin mining currently.\n-\nMethod B:\nAnother innovation leveraging ML and statistical optimisation to reduce the SHA-256 search space, but with a fundamentally different approach than Method A.\n-\nMethod C:\nAn AI Oracle developed by the R&D Machine Learning team to assess in real-time the likelihood that an input to SHA-256 will generate a winning hash. A patent application is under consideration.\nCompany Objectives:\nThe Company\u2019s short-term goal is to develop commercial products and services from the above R&D activities, prioritising Methods A, B and C. The longer-term goals are to develop an in-house ASIC chip for Bitcoin mining as well as a quantum computing based miner.\nCurrent Developments:\nCurrently, the Company is testing Methods A and B through pool-based live mining. These tests are being conducted in order to assess the improved performance of commercial ASIC chips when these chips are controlled by the two Methods. Significantly, the two Methods can be applied to existing ASIC-based mining machines simply as a client-server software upgrade. QBT\u2019s recent software switch from CG Miner to ESP-miner is expected to assist and facilitate the testing programme. If the results of the live testing are successful, Method A and B could thereafter be made available as SaaS products.\nMethod C, which requires its integration at chip-level, is undergoing real time mining tests using slower FPGA chips on historic blockchain blocks. This provides the Company with a Bitcoin mining difficulty compatible with the hashing power of available FPGAs in order to allow the team to understand the chip mapping process for the purpose of scaling up towards commercial ASIC integration.\nShould any of the tests confirm the R&D team\u2019s findings, the Company may consider potential partnerships with either miners or chip manufacturers to quickly deploy Method A and Method B on ASIC Mining Machines and Method C on an ASIC chip. In preparation for this eventuality, QBT has already initiated high-level discussions with key industry players.\nQBT\u2019s longer-term strat",

The primary goal of the R&D programme is to develop Bitcoin mining tools and techniques, via its technology-driven approach, which the Company believes will significantly outperform existing market practices.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDuring the first half of 2024, QBT continued to focus its efforts on developing the first commercial Bitcoin mining products and services that utilises its intensive R&D programme.\nR&D\nThe R&D programme has achieved several positive milestones so far:\n-\nAsic UltraBoost:\nDesigned to improve Bitcoin mining by eliminating redundant computations in a key part of the mining algorithm, resulting in faster and more efficient operations. A patent application has been filed with patent offices in the UK and the EU (which also covers the UK), as well as the\nUSA\n,\nCanada\n,\nAustralia\nand\nSouth Korea\n.\n-\nAsic Enhanced Boost\n: An optimised approach to SHA-256 computation for Bitcoin mining that enables partial pre-computation of future blockchain blocks. A patent application has also been submitted to the UK and EU patent offices.\n-\nQuantum Mining\n: A quantum version of the Bitcoin mining algorithm that utilises qubit-based quantum computation and quantum logic gates. A patent application for this is being drafted and expected to be filed as soon as practicable in jurisdictions to be determined.\n-\nMethod A\n: A Machine Learning (\u201cML\u201d) based approach aimed at reducing the SHA-256 search space compared to the brute-force method used in Bitcoin mining currently.\n-\nMethod B:\nAnother innovation leveraging ML and statistical optimisation to reduce the SHA-256 search space, but with a fundamentally different approach than Method A.\n-\nMethod C:\nAn AI Oracle developed by the R&D Machine Learning team to assess in real-time the likelihood that an input to SHA-256 will generate a winning hash. A patent application is under consideration.\nCompany Objectives:\nThe Company\u2019s short-term goal is to develop commercial products and services from the above R&D activities, prioritising Methods A, B and C. The longer-term goals are to develop an in-house ASIC chip for Bitcoin mining as well as a quantum computing based miner.\nCurrent Developments:\nCurrently, the Company is testing Methods A and B through pool-based live mining. These tests are being conducted in order to assess the improved performance of commercial ASIC chips when these chips are controlled by the two Methods. Significantly, the two Methods can be applied to existing ASIC-based mining machines simply as a client-server software upgrade. QBT\u2019s recent software switch from CG Miner to ESP-miner is expected to assist and facilitate the testing programme. If the results of the live testing are successful, Method A and B could thereafter be made available as SaaS products.\nMethod C, which requires its integration at chip-level, is undergoing real time mining tests using slower FPGA chips on historic blockchain blocks. This provides the Company with a Bitcoin mining difficulty compatible with the hashing power of available FPGAs in order to allow the team to understand the chip mapping process for the purpose of scaling up towards commercial ASIC integration.\nShould any of the tests confirm the R&D team\u2019s findings, the Company may consider potential partnerships with either miners or chip manufacturers to quickly deploy Method A and Method B on ASIC Mining Machines and Method C on an ASIC chip. In preparation for this eventuality, QBT has already initiated high-level discussions with key industry players.\nQBT\u2019s longer-term strategy of using its Quantum Mining Algorithm still requires more advanced quantum computing power than is currently available, so the Company will review this project in 2025.\nQBT\u2019s previously announced project to build in-house its own Bitcoin mining chip. This is anticipated to commence once the relevant patents have ",

As well as showcasing QBT\u2019s technology, the Company met with a number of potential\nNorth America\nmining partners and consultants, in order to consolidate its existing business contacts and establish new ones, in preparation for the planned commercial deployment of the three Methods.\nR&D Activity\nWhile QBT\u2019s AI-based mining technology has shown consistent results under laboratory conditions, supported by verifiable experimental data, the Company\u2019s research teams are continuously challenging the efficiency of the obtained results to further improve them.\nQBT\u2019s software engineers are continuing to attempt to successfully port the Methods to existing commercial ASIC-based mining hardware and software system, via CGMiner. This remains challenging due to the severe limitations of most current ASIC architectures for implementing SHA-256. These limitations are mainly due to the speed and power consumption inefficiencies created by the designers, which impact the ability to use any arbitrary input to SHA-256.\nA decision has been taken, therefore, to migrate away from CGMiner to AxeOS (ESP-miner), a more recently developed and, in the Company\u2019s opinion, a better designed public domain operating system software for Bitcoin mining devices. The Company has found that CGMiner, which is considered the leading operating system for Bitcoin mining, added elements of unpredictability to a number of processes, due mainly to the code being developed over the last 13 years by a large number of contributors, each adding a new elements to the mining software. Therefore, while CGMiner was initially used by QBT to achieve the porting of its Methods, its high-level of inefficiency has now been recognised and the change to ESP-miner has been implemented.\nESP-miner was created by Open Source Miners United (OSMU), of which QBT is a sponsor, and incorporates the essential firmware-like functionalities of the FPGA component, which is the second processor of the current mining rigs\u2019 control boards that provides time communication with the hashing boards.\nESP-miner uses the same processor for both the operating system and the firmware-like functionalities: the\nESP32\n-S3 Espressif MCU (micro controller unit).\nThe combination of ESP-miner and the new family of BM1366 ASIC is now QBT\u2019s new real-time operational environment for porting and testing the three Methods in a real-time mining mode. Other hardware and software platforms from OSMU are currently being assessed.\nMethod A\nThe key data from Method A\u2019s neural network training dataset is the accurate real-time measurement of the hashing time; specifically, the more precise the measure, the better the performance of the Method.\nThe Company\u2019s main objective has been to collect such information in real-time while hashing is taking place on the ASIC chip. This was obtained by developing specific modifications to CGminer, replacing indirect time measure with direct measure.\nThe same functionalities will be implemented in ESP-miner and the Company believes it will lead to even better real-time hashing time measuring, given the easier access to the firmware-like functionalities of this new software environment.\nMethod B\nThe porting of Method B will continue using the new ESP-miner software platform, making the control of the BM1366 chips easier, more efficient, stable and reliable.\nIn parallel to this, a new tool has been developed by QBT for real-time mining testing which will bypass CGminer and any other m",

The Company has commenced an aggressive R&D and investment programme in the dynamic world of Blockchain Technology, which includes cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.\nCHAIRMAN\u2019S STATEMENT\nI am pleased to present the Group\u2019s Final Results for the year ended\n31 December 2023\n. The Group consists of Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cQBT\u201d), which undertakes the Group\u2019s Research and Development (\u201cR&D\u201d) Programme and holds the Legacy Assets, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Clear Leisure 2017 Ltd (\u201cCL17\u201d), which deals with the legal claims and related litigation.\nDuring 2023, the main focus of the Company has been the R&D Programme, launched in 2021, which aims to develop a proprietary disruptive technology for mining Bitcoin through the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Quantum Computing and a special architecture for ASIC chips design for mining rigs. The capitalisation of the Bitcoin market as at the date of this report exceeds\nUSD1.3 trillion\n, therefore, a technology which could bring a competitive advantage to existing Bitcoin miners is considered by the Company as potentially valuable.\nThe Company has several independent R&D teams working on each of the above technologies, based in\nLondon\n(UK),\nMunich\n(\nGermany\n) and\nMilan\n(\nItaly\n).\nThe first goal of QBT\u2019s R&D Programme is to create AI software to improve the mining power of existing Bitcoin mining rigs. By applying AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, three different R&D teams have independently achieved very promising results from internal laboratory tests for the Company\u2019s three proprietary methods, called \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d. While they are materially different, each method has substantiated the Company\u2019s initial assumption,\ni.e\n., that SHA-256, the core algorithm for mining of Bitcoin, is to some extent predictable. Hence calculations can be limited only to those cases where the chance of successfully mining Bitcoin is higher, resulting in better overall performance of the mining process.\nThe Company is now working on adapting its three Bitcoin mining methods to existing mining rigs in order to launch the first commercial QBT products, as Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) for Bitcoin miners.\nA second goal, which has a mid to long term timeframe, is the development of a proprietary mining chip which includes all the internal R&D results, as per the two patent applications filed in 2021 and 2023.\nFinally, the third objective will be the implementation of \u201cQuantum Mining\u201d, which is a proprietary quantum version of SHA-256 algorithm for Bitcoin mining. A patent application for this implementation is in the process of being drafted at the time of publication of this report.\nIn order to use QBT\u2019s proprietary quantum algorithm for Bitcoin mining, a quantum computer with more qubits than is currently commercially available is required. Therefore, the Company is planning ahead to be in a position to use this opportunity when such quantum computer is available.\nDuring 2023, the Company continued to deal with its Legacy Assets, with special focus on the litigation against the former management and internal audit committee of Sipiem in Liquidazione Spa (\u201cSipiem\u201d), which is held via CL17. In late 2022, the\nVenice\nCourt ruled in favour of CL17 and ordered Sipiem defendants to pay CL17 \u20ac6,274,000 in damages (exclusive of interest and adjustments for inflation), and legal fees (together the \u201cAward Payment\u201d).\nThe Company also continued to deal with its other Legacy Assets, such as the Sosushi Srl (\u201cSosus",

As a result, all damages awarded to CL17 as announced on\n1 November 2022\nwere upheld by the Court, with the sole exception being the reduction of liability for one of the former directors by an amount of \u20ac105,412, reducing the total damage award to c.\u20ac6.1m, (the \u201dJudgment\u201d).\nThe Court confirmed the liability of the former directors and statutory auditors of Sipiem and also extended the finding of liability to the members of the internal audit committee, former directors and the main defendant\u2019s family members whom the Court had, at a preliminary holding in the appeal, suspended enforcement of the lower court\u2019s Judgment pending the appeal\u2019s outcome.\nFinally, the Court accepted a withdrawal of an appeal by from one of the former Sipiem directors against her insurer.\nAs a result, the Company may now seek to fully enforce the Judgment against all of the defendants for an aggregate amount of \u20ac6,083,562 in damages (plus interest and adjustments for inflation to accrue from different dates until the date of satisfaction of the Judgment), plus \u20ac85,499 in legal expenses for the trial court action and \u20ac48,677 in legal expenses for the appeal (such latter expense to be satisfied by one of the defendants\u2019 insurers). Other legal expenses were reciprocally compensated and \u20ac5,000 were assessed against all parties.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s announcements of 16 May and\n4 June 2024\n, a settlement agreement of \u20ac700,000, with certain defendants and their professional insurer (the \u201cSettlement\u201d), was subject to the scheduling, by the\nVenice\nCourt, of a hearing to approve the Settlement, before the issue of the appeal ruling. The appeal ruling has however been issued prior to the scheduling of the hearing, and therefore, the \u20ac700,000 settlement agreement shall now be deemed void.\nConsequently, the agreement with the Sipiem Receiver (\u201dReceiver\u201d) for the purchase of the Receiver\u2019s right on the 30% of any sum collected (net of legal fees) is no longer legally valid, as it was conditional on Court approval of the above Settlement. Hence, the Receiver will maintain its right to 30% of the damages recovered net of all connected costs borne by CL17 for the recovery, as per the original agreement of these terms between CL17 and the Receiver in 2019.\nWhile the above matter is currently being assessed by the Company\u2019s legal team, the Company still hold the above Settlement funds, minus the \u20ac170,000 paid to the Receiver for the 30% rights. In the meantime, all the parties involved, namely the Receiver, the Sipiem\u2019s statutory auditor\u2019s lawyers and the insurer\u2019s lawyers are being contacted to discuss the contractual implications of the voided Settlement.\nAn update of the above negotiations in respect of the voided Settlement will be announced as soon as practicable.\nAs a final result:\n-\nThe\nVenice\nCourt of Appeal confirmed the ruling of the\n1 November 2022\nlower court Judgment in favour of CL17 (save for \u20ac105,412), amounting to \u20ac6,083,562 (plus interest and adjustments for inflation) in damages, plus \u20ac134,166 for legal expenses.\n-\nThe\nVenice\nCourt of Appeal, by ruling, also removed any opposition to the enforceability, by CL17, of the above amounts against all defendants.\n-\nSipiem\u2019s statutory auditors have been ordered to pay the full amount of the Judgment upheld by the Court, i.e. \u20ac1,000,000 - which is part of the \u20ac6,083,562 - (plus interest and adjustments for inflation to accrue from different dates until the date of payment), instead of the agreed \u20ac700,000 under the resolved Settlement agreement announced by the Company on\n16 May 2024\n.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, Executive Chairman of QBT, commented:\n\u201d\nWe are extremely pleased with the\nVenice\nCourt of Appeal result, which confirms previous ruling while extending the scope of its enforceability. QBT subsidiary CL17 will now focus on the collection of the \u20ac6.083m plus interest and adjustments for inflation. CL17 has also been awarded \u20ac134,166 for legal expenses. The Company will ensure that CL17 proceeds with maximum effort to seek and collect the funds from\nthe\ndefendants.\u201d\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union",

As a result, all judgment debt and/or settlement funds hereafter collected by CL17 will be entirely retained by it.\nUnder the terms of the 2019 agreement,\nCL17 acquired the rights to certain claims against the former Sipiem directors and members of the statutory audit committee from Sipiem's liquidator, for \u20ac50,000 (of which \u20ac30,000 is being held in an escrow account) plus 30% of any sums collected, net of legal and other costs conditional on the ruling against the defendants.\nIn\nOctober 2022\n, the\nVenice\nCourt ruled in favour of CL17 for a sum of \u20ac6.275 million plus interest and inflation adjustment, to be paid by the defendants (the \"Judgment\").\nIn\nFebruary 2023\n, all defendants appealed the ruling and filed a request for the collection actions by CL17 to be frozen until the outcome of the appeal.\nThe application was approved in part by the\nVenice\nCourt, with the exception of the main defendant and one former director who continue to remain subject to enforcement of the Judgment.\nMore recently, most of those Sipiem defendants who benefited from the\nFebruary 2023\ncourt order offered CL17 a settlement, subject to, among other things, the Receiver's waiving pursuit of any possible civil and/or criminal claims against them. Such settlement would involve an insurance provider for these specific defendants\nFollowing negotiations between CL17 and the Receiver regarding the proposed settlement and the potential length of time to successfully conclude any collection actions, the Receiver has agreed, with the approval of the Rovigo Insolvency Court Judge in charge of the Sipiem bankruptcy case to sell to CL17 its rights reserved in the 2019 agreement, namely\n30% of any sums collected from the Sipiem matter, net of legal costs for a fixed amount of \u20ac170,000.\nAs a result, CL17 has agreed with these specific defendants currently protected by the\nFebruary 2023\ncourt order to settle a portion of the judgment awarded to CL17. The settlement is for a total cash consideration of \u20ac700,000, to be paid in two installments, respectively within 20 and 30 days from the execution of the preliminary settlement agreement completed on\n29 April 2024\n.\nThe aforementioned \u20ac700,000 settlement further remains conditional upon the approval by the\nVenice\nCourt of Appeal. The interested parties have already filed a joint application with that Court for this purpose.\nIn the event, however, that the\nVenice\nCourt of Appeal does not set the hearing date to approve the settlement before its ruling on the appeal before it against the original Judgment, the preliminary agreement will be void.\nThe remaining value of the Judgment (provided the settlement is confirmed by the Court) is approximately \u20ac5.575 million (plus interest and inflation adjustment). CL17 continues its efforts to collect this amount from the remaining main defendant and the other defendant not subject to the settlement agreement.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n: \"We are very happy with the outcome of this double negotiation with the Defendants and the Receiver, which allows us to cash in the first tangible result of the Sipiem Litigation and now gives us the rights to all funds recovered, namely the \u20ac700,000 of this agreement and the balance amounting to \u20ac5.575 million plus interest and augmentation for inflation.\nThis provides us with an improved negotiating position regarding the collection of the remaining amount due to us\"\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman\n+39 335 296573\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJeff Keating\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nKasia Brzozowska\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is an AIM listed investment company which has recently realigned its strategic focus to technology related investments, with special regard to Quantum computing, Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and AI sectors.

          "full_content": "13 Mar 2024 07:00\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc - R&D Update\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc - R&D Update\nPR Newswire\nLONDON, United Kingdom, March 13\n13 March 2024\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n(\u201cQBT\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d)\nR&D and Business Update\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focusing on a R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to provide an update of its recent R&D activities in the development of its disruptive Bitcoin mining technologies.\nNew Development: Method C\nMethod C \u2013 a new development based on Machine Learning and using predictive Artificial Intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) oracle technology is producing consistent results during testing.\nMethod C in testing environments has favorably demonstrated predictive ability in c. 30% of the cases, if an input to SHA-256 will produce a winning hash, resulting in a potential saving of energy.\nLaboratory testing of a new Machine Learning Method applied to SHA-256 computational optimisation, Method C, is nearing completion. Consistent results have been achieved over the last few months, which confirm the performance of this new QBT proprietary predictive AI oracle, based on neural networks and other Machine Learning methods.\nThe fundamental feature of Method C is its ability to predict whether an input to SHA-256, the core algorithm for Bitcoin mining, is likely to generate a winning hash, or not. The underlying assumption for Method C is that an oracle decision is materially less computationally demanding than the SHA-256 calculation for the same input string.\nThe current average predictive performance of Method C in a testing environment is nearly30% , meaning that\nSHA-256 will avoid processing an input when the oracle will assess, within the current block, or the adjacent future Bitcoin blockchain blocks, that it is highly unlikely to generate a winning hash, namely almost 30% of the times. The Company believes this achievement to be a major technical advancement for the SHA-256 algorithm, and therefore for the Bitcoin mining industry.\nThe Company is currently in the process of assessing projected overall cost savings to end users of Method C particularly given that, in order to execute Method C, the ASIC chip must run additional logic gates in conjunction with SHA-256. It is believed that through reduction of the number of SHA-256 computations by almost 30%, additional energy saving costs will be made despite the energy used by the oracle.\nMethod C differs from previously reported QBT\u2019s Methods A and Method B in that the former needs to be directly implemented onto the ASIC chip at the manufacturing stage, whereas Methods A and B can be supplied to already existing miners as a SaaS product.\nIn parallel, following recent lab results, the Company is also evaluating the use of Method C in conjunction with second patent application technology (which itself is the subject of a current patent application) that could avoid the need of such hardware implementation on an ASIC chip, in order to operate Method C.\nBusiness Developments\nThe Company has entered into early-stage exploratory discussions with Bitcoin rig manufacturers and US Bitcoin mining companies.\nThe Company believes that these discussions represent the first steps towards entering into commercial and technical negotiations.\nThe Company has, over the past nine months, entered into early-stage exploratory discussions, under Non-Disclosure Agreements (\u201cNDA\u201d), with two large mining rig manufacturers in\nChina\nand\nNorth America\nand with two of the largest US Bitcoin mining companies. The board believes that these discussions represent the first steps towards entering into commercial and technical negotiations with the largest players in both the Bitcoin mining market and in the Bitcoin mining rig manufacturing industry.\nQBT Proprietary ASIC chip\nThe Company has commenced development of a proprietary ASIC chip. A working prototype is about to undergo development which will confirm performance levels.\nThe Company has started a process to design and build a proprietary ASIC chip for Bitcoin mining. Initial chips will be designed in an established process node during the testing phase. The prototype will implement the proprietary optimised version of SHA-256, as per the Company\u2019s two patent applications (i.e., ASIC UltraBoost and ASIC EnhanceBoost) as well as the new Method C. It is expected that a working prototype will confirm the architecture feasibility and performance of this new QBT proprietary intellectual property.\nOnce manufactured, the chips will not be used for industrial Bitcoin mining, instead they will be utilised as an affordable real-world proving ground for QBT\u2019s disruptive Bitcoin mining technology. The Company believes that by creating its own chip it will be better situated to construct its new architecture from the ground up. The Company has decided to facilitate this development with a mature process node chip",

The Company has commenced an aggressive R&D and investment programme in the dynamic world of Blockchain Technology, which includes cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nDuring the first half of 2023 (\u201cPeriod\u201d), Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc maintained focus on its research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) strategy, but also started to set the basis for the commercialisation of the products under development.\nIn addition, the Company continues its endeavours to recover damages and legal expenses from its legacy legal actions taken in the Italian courts.\nBitcoin Mining R&D\nThe bitcoin mining industry has, in the past, sought mainly to achieve improvements by regularly optimising hardware and its integrated firmware, which is a capital-intensive endeavour. The Company, with its R&D team of senior researchers from leading European universities, has instead taken a different approach. QBT is focusing its intensive R&D efforts on identifying and utilising certain key predictive properties in the operation of bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 cryptographic hash functions an area that the Company believes is not currently being addressed on the same scale by any other market participant.\nTo enhance its research and development capabilities and eventually its commercial prospects, the Company announced in\nJanuary 2023\nthat it had appointed Dr\nLov Kumar Grover\nas a special consultant. He is now working with QBT\u2019s Quantum Computing Team. Specifically, Dr Grover and the team are focused on improving the already developed proprietary quantum version of SHA-256, also known as the \u201cQuantum Mining Algorithm\u201d, being the translation of the bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d) mining algorithm for quantum computers. As previously discussed in the Company's recent announcements, currently there are no quantum computers with sufficient qubits to run QBT\u2019s Quantum Mining Algorithm, but once these become available, the Company expects to be in a highly advantageous position to offer a BTC mining method that could offer significant improvements and efficiency to the industry.\nDuring the first half of 2023, the Company also announced its Machine Learning teams had developed two unique methods (Method A and Method B) that could potentially lead to immediate performance improvements for existing BTC miners. A third improvement (\u201cMethod C\u201d) is currently being assessed by a different QBT R&D group.\nWith regard to Method B, during the Period, the Company completed a key testing phase that demonstrated Method B theoretically increases the rate of successful bitcoin mining by approximately 2.6 times compared to standard bitcoin mining industry practices widely used over the same time period. The Company\u2019s algorithm also theoretically reduced electricity consumption by 4.3%.\nThe Company\u2019s current main focus is to complete the development of software that will permit the use of Method A and Method B (and possibly Method C) for use by existing BTC miners. It is anticipated that this will enable the relevant QBT R&D groups to run real time tests (both, simulated experiments and pool based real time mining for testing and experimental purposes) at current mining degrees of difficulty and thereby allow QBT to commence the commercialisation phase of its discoveries. As announced in\nSeptember 2023\n, QBT successfully redesigned part of Method B specifically for application on the Chinese market-leading mining rig, significantly expanding its addressable market.\nTowards this commercialisation, in\nMay 2023\n, QBT engaged Mr\nVladimir Kusznirczuk\n, as Marketing and Business Development Manager. Mr Kusznirczuk was appointed to seek commercial opportunities with large US and Canadian bitcoin miners and manufacturers of mining rigs..\nThe Company is currently in discussions with a number of the largest North American cryptocurrency miners which provided the Company with a number of the most commonly used mining ri",

This typically entails these parties providing QBT with a number of the most commonly used mining rigs available in the market for the Company to study and implement the porting of its Method A and Method B chip enhancements.\nThe Company is targeting not only Intel\u2019s Blockscale based miners, but also the most popular mining rigs produced in\nChina\n, which are used by more than 75% of the global Bitcoin market\n(1}\n. However, due to lack of publicly available technical documents concerning the mining machines produced by\nAsia\n-based manufacturers, the Company has been faced with a very challenging software engineering project. Nonetheless, through the partial redesign of Method B, the Company can start porting on the equipment made by the largest mining rig manufacturer in that region. The Company\u2019s R&D Machine Learning team has been able to quickly modify Method B while retaining the entirety of its performance enhancements, as confirmed through internal testing undertaken by the R&D team. QBT expects that this encouraging result will (once the porting of Method B on the mining rig firmware has been completed), allow the Company to pursue commercial arrangements for the deployment of QBT\u2019s methods in the mining hardware market segment.\nAs a result, the Company is looking to engage with potential partners to deploy Method B in Chinese produced mining rigs, which currently represent over 75%\n{1}\nof all operational machines in the Bitcoin mining industry. In monetary terms, at the current overall hashing power of the Bitcoin network, this represents more than 2.5 million miners\n{2}\n, costing an estimated\nUSD 5 billion\nat an average cost of\nUSD 2,000\nper mining rig.\nInstalling QBT\u2019s Method B on Chinese manufactured rigs is anticipated to increase the success rate of the mining probability of these machines by 2.6 times. Because of the intrinsic nature of Method B, in order to achieve the same mining success rate a mining enterprise would have to increase its hashing power by 50%. QBT believes, therefore, that employing Method B QBT believes this could provide meaningful cost savings to the whole bitcoin mining industry, in terms of reduced aggregate capital expenditure. Furthermore, increasing the hashing power, via Method B\u2019s software, without adding new miners could represent a major energy saving.\nFurther announcements in relation to the porting of Method B on Asian manufactured mining rigs will be made in due course.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman of QBT commented:\n\u201c\nQBT has now entered into the engineering phase of its first two products: Method A which our laboratory tests show an increase in the mining performance by nearly 10% and Method B, which increase the mining probability by 2.6 times. The overall response from the North American miners has been encouraging ; by increasing the hashing power, without increasing CAPEX could, in their view, be a game-changer, especially in the current market, where the price of Bitcoin has fallen below\n$30,000\nand with the next \u2019halving\u2019 expected in about nine months.\n\u201c\nThe Company, therefore, is focusing its main efforts on speeding up the porting process of both Method A and B\nin order to reach commerciality.\u201d\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Executive Chairman\n+39 335 296573\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJeff Keating\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nKasia Brzozowska\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nAbout\nQuantum\nBlockchain\nTechnologies\nPlc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is an AIM listed investment company with a strategic focus on Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Artificial Intelligence.

The Company believes that this novel approach, called\nMessage Scheduling For Cryptographic Hashing\n(\u201cMSFCA\u201d), addresses one of the most challenging problems in BTC mining: partial pre-computing of future blockchains\u2019 blocks.\nA patent application in respect of MSFCA has been filed at the UK Intellectual Property Office. If the application is successful, the Company intends to apply for the patent to be extended internationally.\nSUMMARY\nMSFCA can perform pre-calculations for future BTC blocks before the current block is closed\nAllows miners to use less logic gates, thus lower energy costs\nImplementation can be made to QBT\u2019s current SHA-256 architecture with feasible modifications\nEffective potential area saving is around 8%\nBACKGROUND\nApproximately every ten minutes a block is added to the BTC blockchain. Each new block represents the confirmation of the validity of the encrypted transactions, i.e. transfer of BTCs between senders and receivers, usually between, on average, 2,000 and 3,000. The miner who finds the winning hash for the block within ten minutes, causes the block to be closed and receives the reward; currently 6.25 BTCs, plus the transaction fees. A new block in the following ten minutes can then start to be processed, but only when the previous block has been closed, because the starting information to compute the new blocks, contains information from the previous closed block.\nMSFCA\nThe computational optimisation obtained by MSFCA allows, under BTC mining special conditions, the miner to asynchronously perform (i.e. not within the temporal boundaries of the current block being computed\n)\npartial pre-computations of future blocks, before the ten minute computation \u2018time target\u2019 for closing a new block begins. The benefit being that all the logical gates and computation time on the ASIC chip needed for the specific partial pre-computation are saved.\nQBT believes this is a novel procedure, potentially capable, in certain conditions, of addressing a key BTC mining limitation that prevents asynchronous pre-computation of a new block in the blockchain prior to the previous block being\nclosed.\nApplication of MSFCA is not believed to enhance SHA-256\u2019s computation performance time; however, by enabling partial SHA-256 pre-processing of the block, it makes it possible to save the hardware resources otherwise necessary for standard SHA-256 computation. From this perspective, it is anticipated that energy would be saved due to less logic gates being present on the ASIC allowing the same chip area to be used to implement additional SHA-256 engines and increasing the overall speed of the process.\nThe key principle of this approach is that the partial pre-computation can occur asynchronously. Implementation of MSFCA will require a specific ASIC architecture, hence a specific ASIC chip will need to be designed, however the Company believes this would only require a feasible modification of the current SHA-256 proprietary implementation being developed by QBT.\nIn terms of SHA-256 ASIC chip areas, the projected potential saving would be in the region of 25% for one instance of SHA256\nout of the three instances involved in Bitcoin mining. However, because of other well-known optimisation techniques, the effective\npotential area saving of MSFCA is estimated by the Company\u2019s ASIC designer to be around 8% on average.\nThe handling of pre-processed data requires additional circuitry, the impact of which is expected to be negligible in the near future.\nWhile MSFCA can be implemented with currently available technology, by adding a logical gate overhead, in the near future, the Company believes these overheads will be less relevant, making this approach even more competitive.\nDespite\npresent technological\nlimitations, (for example, the limited throughput of memory chips), the Company believes that it is strategically important to file a patent application covering the novel approach created through the use of MSFCA.\nFrancesco Gardin\n, CEO and Chairman commented\n:\n\u201c\nWhile at this juncture we cannot go into the specific details of what we believe is an innovative solution designed by our R&D cryptography team, suffice it to say\nthat the new concept behind this idea disrupts, under special conditions, a fundamental BTC blockchain paradigm; computation for future blocks can take place before the previous block is mined. This is quite a radical change of the paradigm, and we believe it is well worth a patent ap",

I disagree with Mikeydj's assertion that QBT are not required to issue an RNS to advise of a project being abandoned. When investors have been built up by the company to expect significant revenue from the project, then many investors might ferl that to abandon the project is specific price-sensitive information, and must be disclosed as soon as possible. P.S. Does QBT not have the ability and resources to work on multiple projects simultaneously? I'm sure Gardin was boasting about this in previous interviews, or it might be on the website. A team of 20 experts rings a bell. If QBT are no longer able to work on multiple projects concurrently then one possible reason is a reduction in the number of people working for them.",

An RNS reports material developments, not a full internal project status list.

They are required to RNS if something materially changes the company\u2019s prospects, such as formal cancellation, disposal, or write-off.

R&D focus shifts constantly without implying staff cuts or project failure.

An unimpressive  Usersteve post is not evidence. Until there is an RNS saying a project is cancelled, sold, or written off, calling it \u201cabandoned\u201d is opinion, not fact.

These two caveats make it explicit that all QBT are reporting is the belief or gut feeling of the Board; they are not reporting any independently verified confirmation that any of the Methods work. The second caveat (\"have the potential\") is also a reminder that even if the Methods work as claimed, then QBT are explicitly advising investors that there still is only a potential to \"transform the economics of Bitcoin mining by improving performance\". In other words, QBT's goal still might not happen. In summary, the quote you selected is a very good reminder that QBT's Methods are highly speculative and not at all guaranteed to be successful in generating revenue. This should come as no surprise - this is an AIM company, after all. Throughout its 25-year history QBT has not achieved any significant sustained revenue or profit, so it is my view that for them to do so now will require a lot more than mere blurbs of belief and pontification of potential from the Board.",

But there are a few important points you\u2019re glossing over. First, on \u201cALL assets\u201d: SaaS was originally a commercial delivery route for Methods A & B, not a separate core technology asset in its own right. Once the company pivoted to Method C (as per last RNS) and to working directly with hardware partners, the relevance of SaaS as a standalone product route obviously has seemingly  diminished. That doesn\u2019t mean the underlying IP vanished \u2014 it means the route to market changed. Second, on verification: You\u2019re right that the RNS does not claim independent commercial validation yet. What it does say (in multiple RNS since 2024) is that: testing is being conducted with external partners Method C is being evaluated across multiple SHA-256 implementations independent verification is part of the stated process That is a step beyond \u201cboard belief\u201d, even if it is not yet revenue. Third, on \u201cpotential\u201d: Every pre-revenue tech company on AIM uses exactly that language until contracts are signed. That does not make the project meaningless; it means the company is complying with disclosure rules and not overstating certainty. That\u2019s what matters. Everything else is just arguing about adjectives.",

Looking at the RNSs, the most recent mention I found is way back in 10 May 2023 which states: \"The test results show that QBT\u2019s algorithm, known as Method B, has *theoretically* increased the rate of successful bitcoin mining by 2.6 times...\" https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/QBT/bitcoin-mining-update-fptgftoli10f08h.html So that RNS does not even claim their rest results gave a 2.6 times improvement; only that the increase was theoretical. If we go even further back, the 15 November 2022 RNS states: \"Preliminary results of Machine Learning Method \u201cB\u201d indicating 30% improvement over commercially available ASIC chip-based miners.\" https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/QBT/update-on-bitcoin-rd-cuytjnxqper351j.html So the 30% preliminary result increased to a 160% theoretical result. Regarding the \"north of 10%\" bit, this performance result does not appear in any RNS at all. It was merely mumbled as an aside in one of Gardin's interviews. So as MikeyDj suggests, best to disregard any interviews and just use RNSs for facts. In the 24 Jun 2025 final results RNS it states: \"With regards to Method B, the Company commenced real-time mining tests using the same ASIC chip used in the latest version of the most powerful Bitcoin mining rigs available.\" No RNS provides the test results. In fact, the three RNSs after the final results which contain updates on the R&D (24 Sep, 12 Nov, and 5 Dec 2025) all contain no results of Method B testing. However, those RNSs focus on Method C software. If we follow MikeyDj's advice, then this pivot towards Method C software and no update on Method B can be interpreted as Method B being de-prioritised or abandoned. So, the facts from Method B's performance is: it changes a lot; only theoretical or lab results; real-world results not published; likely has been shelved. My gut feeling is that the test results obtained from the ASIC manufacturers were so poor that they withdrew from the process, and QBT decided to pursue a different route.",

To my knowledge QBT have never announced mining an actual block Bitcoin and using 2 FPGA systems they are very unlikely to do so. We are led to believe the Methods increase the chances of finding the block winning hash but Increasing a miniscule probability still makes it incredibly unlikely. \"Increasing the probability of finding the block Bitcoin winning hash by 2.6 times ...\"  is more like what they should be claiming. From memory the only thing they have actually claimed is a few Satoshi from a mining pool. Since they are mining in a pool the improved performance of a single FPGA miner in the pool would be negligee. I'll leave the maths to a statistician to determine how long you would have to mine before you could claim better results by using one FPGA rig + Method.  Of course there would be many provisos involved. Finding Share hashes could be considered successful bitcoin mining!!",

When Gardin says or writes \"we are in discussion with a big ASIC manufacturer\"  there is much assumed by the receiver of the information. First of all the word 'discussion' surely Gardin can't mean 'we are in discussion this very moment\" ?? So then we could ask how often ? Is it face to face talks  ? Zoom discussions? An exchange of emails ? Who are 'we'? What is being discussed? A single communication  between CEOs, engineers or sales team could be defined as discussions if it ended with \"I'll let you know\" Of course the word 'big' itself is open to wild speculation. The point of this ramble is language and it's misuse is endemic. I've said here, over the years, \"communication- the work of the devil\" . Virtually every statement made by Gardin can be analysed to the death and many interpretations deduced. Your ideal of dealing with 'facts' is simply not easy to follow in practise. Speculating what Gardin writes and says drives discussion here. Time will decide !",

Words like \u201cdiscussion\u201d, \u201cprogress\u201d, or \u201cbig\u201d are inherently non-quantitative and open to interpretation. That\u2019s precisely why I default to distinguishing between what is explicitly stated and what is inferred. Where we differ is here: \u2022 Interpretation is inevitable \u2022 But inference is not the same as fact When an RNS says \u201cin discussion with a large ASIC manufacturer\u201d, the fact is that discussions have occurred. Anything beyond that \u2014 frequency, depth, outcome, or likelihood of success \u2014 is interpretation. Some interpretations may later prove correct, others not, but they remain speculative until confirmed. That isn\u2019t \u201cmy philosophy of facts\u201d, it\u2019s simply how regulated disclosure works. Speculation absolutely drives forum discussion \u2014 that\u2019s normal \u2014 but problems arise when speculation is later presented as if it were retrospectively factual (\u201cthey withdrew\u201d, \u201cit was abandoned\u201d, \u201cit failed\u201d) without an RNS to support it. So to be clear: Analysing language is fair Discussing probabilities is fair Presenting assumptions as settled outcomes is not, and is simply misleading for the readers Time will decide ?  agreed. But until it does, separating disclosed facts from personal interpretation is what keeps debate honest rather than narrative-driven. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing here.",

It's supposed to represent the advantage of methods. How can the workings of the Methods be demonstrated - full stop.? There is a difference between demonstrating results and workings. It is relatively easy to demonstrate the advantages of a pulley system but more difficult to demonstrate how it obtains it's advantage I.e. it's workings. I think your question is wrong, no I'm not a politician. But on the other hand it is possible a streaming result of hashes from a mining rig actively mining Bitcoin could demonstrate 'something' Why would you demonstrate your 'methods' your proprietary secrets to anyone ?

Is it possible to demonstrate on an IPhone the workings of the 3 methods?\" I'm not sure the workings matter if what we all want to know is if the Methods give measurable real-world increase in mining reward or not. Most reputable mining pools have a performance dashboard which reports the miner's hash rate achieved and reward received, among other metrics. Typically these measures can be viewed as line charts, so you can see how those measures perform over time and in comparison to other metrics. If QBT have their Methods in a mining pool, they could easily view the performance dashboard of their miners on any device, including an iPhone. QBT should have 2 identical miners (or sets of miners), one with a Method and one without, and then publish the metrics of those two miners/sets. QBT could publish their bitcoin wallet address so that anyone can verify with a blockchain explorer that the rewards they claimed have been received have indeed been received into the bitcoin wallet. If QBT do that, and if the results show a statistically significant difference in rewards between the 2 miners/sets, then my view is that a substantial re-rate would follow.",

Here is a list: \"...hugely confident ... fingers crossed for mining RNS in the meantime\" (fishandchp, 17 Mar 2021 09:17 in CLP.L) \"We could be some INCREDIBLE results soon. Just gotta be patient for now. I don't think it'll happen overnight. Would love to hear RKB's thoughts on timing.\" (fishandchp, 22 Mar 2021 22:15 in CLP.L) \"Excited on where we're heading (5p end of May)\" (fishandchp, 7 May 2021 07:54 in CLP.L) \"Wait till it's [BTC] on the up and the SP will rocket with it only common sense...\" (fishandchp, 21 May 2021 17:23) \"...hopefully we'll be closer to 4.5p by the end of the week.\" (fishandchp, 9 Nov 2021 09:29) \"QBT is in the right place at the right time. 2025 is the breakthrough year.\" (fishandchp, 18 Jan 2025 22:05) \"Very excited to see where this will take us in the week.\" (fishandchp, 20 Jan 2025 09:52) \"Consolidation for now prediction for 2.7p end of next month. Do think this is very conservative given the meetings arranged next week but a realistic timeline nevertheless.\" (fishandchp, 22 Jan 2025 13:06)",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

Although when rolling out an ASIC there are a number of testing steps along the way before fabrication. So I suppose you could say that Method C design was \"rolled out\" to that NDA signatory. But we know from the 5 Dec 2025 RNS that implenenting Method C as an ASIC has been put on the back-burner. Because this Method C ASIC rollout did NOT result in the ASIC project continuing, there is no other way to say this: The Method C ASIC rollout was a failure.",

Seeing as there was a fundraise of \u00a32m to help QBT achieve that SaaS goal, most investors would expect an RNS advising when the Company abandoned the project. But they didn't. Everyone has noticed that QBT do this a lot - they announce a goal, then move the goalposts, and the goal is quietly forgotten about. Many of the positive investors get excited when the goalposts are moved because they think that there is now yet another goal to add to the expected mountain of revenue; and that if we don't hear about how a thing is progressing then the Company must be working hard on it. Thank you, Mikeydj, for reminding investors that when QBT stop mentioning a goal, then it is a strong indication that the goal has been abandoned.",

Namely: Can a vortex be quantified when OldSharedog\u2019s oars pull through the water? Now, some of you may say, \u201cRevd, that\u2019s not science, that\u2019s just you splashing about again.\u201d But I say unto you: where others see splashing, the faithful see data. For when the Revd dips his mighty oars into the lake, the waters do not merely part \u2014 they swirl, they spin, they form vortices of such complexity that even the QBT algorithm pauses, strokes its metaphorical beard, and says, \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s non\u2011linear.\u201d And so the question arises: Can the vortex be measured? Can the turbulence be charted? Can the swirl be quantified in a way that satisfies both physics and the QBT forum on a Sunday morning? My children, the answer is simple: Only if the share price stops bobbing long enough for anyone to get a reading. For the vortex is like the market: \u2022 \tIt spins when you expect calm. \u2022 \tIt calms when you expect spin. \u2022 \tAnd just when you think you\u2019ve modelled it, OldSharedog rows past and ruins the dataset. Some say the vortex represents uncertainty. Others say it represents opportunity. But the Revd says: It represents the exact moment you realise you should\u2019ve bought more at 0.7p. Let us therefore embrace the vortex \u2014 not as a problem to be solved, but as a sign of movement, momentum, and the occasional splash in the face. Go forth this week with faith, humour, and a towel. Amen, and pass the oars. DOG BLESS YOU ALL.",

I disagree with Mikeydj's assertion that QBT are not required to issue an RNS to advise of a project being abandoned. When investors have been built up by the company to expect significant revenue from the project, then many investors might ferl that to abandon the project is specific price-sensitive information, and must be disclosed as soon as possible. P.S. Does QBT not have the ability and resources to work on multiple projects simultaneously? I'm sure Gardin was boasting about this in previous interviews, or it might be on the website. A team of 20 experts rings a bell. If QBT are no longer able to work on multiple projects concurrently then one possible reason is a reduction in the number of people working for them.",

Companies are not required to issue an RNS just because a workstream is paused, deprioritised, or folded into other activity. They are required to RNS if something materially changes the company\u2019s prospects, such as formal cancellation, disposal, or write-off. If SaaS (or any other project) were formally abandoned and written off after being presented as revenue-generating, then yes, that would likely be price-sensitive and require disclosure. But no update does not equal abandonment. That\u2019s your inference, not a regulatory fact. On resources: yes, QBT has said it can run multiple R&D tracks in parallel. That still doesn\u2019t mean every strand is externally reportable at all times, or that timelines won\u2019t change as technical and partner work dictates. R&D focus shifts constantly without implying staff cuts or project failure. So the real difference here is simple: You are treating silence as evidence and being misleading to the readers of this forum I\u2019m saying only disclosed decisions are evidence, which is the only thing that can be relied on. An unimpressive  Usersteve post is not evidence. Until there is an RNS saying a project is cancelled, sold, or written off, calling it \u201cabandoned\u201d is opinion, not fact. Shouting it from the rooftops across multiple forums under the guise of various usernames is dishonest and abhorrent",

I was describing what has been functionally evident from subsequent RNS focus and technical direction, not making a regulatory statement. Since 2024, RNS updates have consistently shifted away from: \u2022 cloud-based optimisation (Methods A & B via SaaS) towards: \u2022 hardware-level integration (Method C) \u2022 then software integrated directly into mining firmware That is a strategic pivot, not the same thing as a declared project termination. Regulatory disclosure is triggered by material financial impact or asset write-off, not by internal reprioritisation of R&D routes. Companies do this all the time without issuing \u201cProject X is dead\u201d announcements. So to be clear: \u2022 I\u2019m not saying SaaS was formally cancelled via RNS \u2022 I am saying it has not been pursued as the commercial route for some time \u2022 And that conclusion is based on what the company has actually reported working on since That\u2019s very different from claiming the company is secretly binning projects or misleading investors \u2014 which is what some posts are implying without evidence. If anyone wants to argue the pivot itself was the wrong decision, that\u2019s a valid debate. But it\u2019s not the same as saying projects were \u201cabandoned without disclosure\u201d.",

These two caveats make it explicit that all QBT are reporting is the belief or gut feeling of the Board; they are not reporting any independently verified confirmation that any of the Methods work. The second caveat (\"have the potential\") is also a reminder that even if the Methods work as claimed, then QBT are explicitly advising investors that there still is only a potential to \"transform the economics of Bitcoin mining by improving performance\". In other words, QBT's goal still might not happen. In summary, the quote you selected is a very good reminder that QBT's Methods are highly speculative and not at all guaranteed to be successful in generating revenue. This should come as no surprise - this is an AIM company, after all. Throughout its 25-year history QBT has not achieved any significant sustained revenue or profit, so it is my view that for them to do so now will require a lot more than mere blurbs of belief and pontification of potential from the Board.",

But there are a few important points you\u2019re glossing over. First, on \u201cALL assets\u201d: SaaS was originally a commercial delivery route for Methods A & B, not a separate core technology asset in its own right. Once the company pivoted to Method C (as per last RNS) and to working directly with hardware partners, the relevance of SaaS as a standalone product route obviously has seemingly  diminished. That doesn\u2019t mean the underlying IP vanished \u2014 it means the route to market changed. Second, on verification: You\u2019re right that the RNS does not claim independent commercial validation yet. What it does say (in multiple RNS since 2024) is that: testing is being conducted with external partners Method C is being evaluated across multiple SHA-256 implementations independent verification is part of the stated process That is a step beyond \u201cboard belief\u201d, even if it is not yet revenue. Third, on \u201cpotential\u201d: Every pre-revenue tech company on AIM uses exactly that language until contracts are signed. That does not make the project meaningless; it means the company is complying with disclosure rules and not overstating certainty. That\u2019s what matters. Everything else is just arguing about adjectives.",

From Grammerly: \"Quotation marks are a type of punctuation with several different functions. They indicate a quotation or direct speech and set words and passages apart from the rest of the text. They signal the use of someone else\u2019s words to help distinguish between the source\u2019s voice and the quoted material.\" https://www.grammarly.com/blog/punctuation-capitalization/quotation-marks/ And to make clear the source of the quoted text, add an in-text citation (author, date, time of post).",

Looking at the RNSs, the most recent mention I found is way back in 10 May 2023 which states: \"The test results show that QBT\u2019s algorithm, known as Method B, has *theoretically* increased the rate of successful bitcoin mining by 2.6 times...\" https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/QBT/bitcoin-mining-update-fptgftoli10f08h.html So that RNS does not even claim their rest results gave a 2.6 times improvement; only that the increase was theoretical. If we go even further back, the 15 November 2022 RNS states: \"Preliminary results of Machine Learning Method \u201cB\u201d indicating 30% improvement over commercially available ASIC chip-based miners.\" https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/QBT/update-on-bitcoin-rd-cuytjnxqper351j.html So the 30% preliminary result increased to a 160% theoretical result. Regarding the \"north of 10%\" bit, this performance result does not appear in any RNS at all. It was merely mumbled as an aside in one of Gardin's interviews. So as MikeyDj suggests, best to disregard any interviews and just use RNSs for facts. In the 24 Jun 2025 final results RNS it states: \"With regards to Method B, the Company commenced real-time mining tests using the same ASIC chip used in the latest version of the most powerful Bitcoin mining rigs available.\" No RNS provides the test results. In fact, the three RNSs after the final results which contain updates on the R&D (24 Sep, 12 Nov, and 5 Dec 2025) all contain no results of Method B testing. However, those RNSs focus on Method C software. If we follow MikeyDj's advice, then this pivot towards Method C software and no update on Method B can be interpreted as Method B being de-prioritised or abandoned. So, the facts from Method B's performance is: it changes a lot; only theoretical or lab results; real-world results not published; likely has been shelved. My gut feeling is that the test results obtained from the ASIC manufacturers were so poor that they withdrew from the process, and QBT decided to pursue a different route.",

To my knowledge QBT have never announced mining an actual block Bitcoin and using 2 FPGA systems they are very unlikely to do so. We are led to believe the Methods increase the chances of finding the block winning hash but Increasing a miniscule probability still makes it incredibly unlikely. \"Increasing the probability of finding the block Bitcoin winning hash by 2.6 times ...\"  is more like what they should be claiming. From memory the only thing they have actually claimed is a few Satoshi from a mining pool. Since they are mining in a pool the improved performance of a single FPGA miner in the pool would be negligee. I'll leave the maths to a statistician to determine how long you would have to mine before you could claim better results by using one FPGA rig + Method.  Of course there would be many provisos involved. Finding Share hashes could be considered successful bitcoin mining!!",

When Gardin says or writes \"we are in discussion with a big ASIC manufacturer\"  there is much assumed by the receiver of the information. First of all the word 'discussion' surely Gardin can't mean 'we are in discussion this very moment\" ?? So then we could ask how often ? Is it face to face talks  ? Zoom discussions? An exchange of emails ? Who are 'we'? What is being discussed? A single communication  between CEOs, engineers or sales team could be defined as discussions if it ended with \"I'll let you know\" Of course the word 'big' itself is open to wild speculation. The point of this ramble is language and it's misuse is endemic. I've said here, over the years, \"communication- the work of the devil\" . Virtually every statement made by Gardin can be analysed to the death and many interpretations deduced. Your ideal of dealing with 'facts' is simply not easy to follow in practise.

That\u2019s precisely why I default to distinguishing between what is explicitly stated and what is inferred. Where we differ is here: \u2022 Interpretation is inevitable \u2022 But inference is not the same as fact When an RNS says \u201cin discussion with a large ASIC manufacturer\u201d, the fact is that discussions have occurred. Anything beyond that \u2014 frequency, depth, outcome, or likelihood of success \u2014 is interpretation. Some interpretations may later prove correct, others not, but they remain speculative until confirmed. That isn\u2019t \u201cmy philosophy of facts\u201d, it\u2019s simply how regulated disclosure works. Speculation absolutely drives forum discussion \u2014 that\u2019s normal \u2014 but problems arise when speculation is later presented as if it were retrospectively factual (\u201cthey withdrew\u201d, \u201cit was abandoned\u201d, \u201cit failed\u201d) without an RNS to support it. So to be clear: Analysing language is fair Discussing probabilities is fair Presenting assumptions as settled outcomes is not, and is simply misleading for the readers Time will decide ?  agreed.

It's supposed to represent the advantage of methods. How can the workings of the Methods be demonstrated - full stop.? There is a difference between demonstrating results and workings. It is relatively easy to demonstrate the advantages of a pulley system but more difficult to demonstrate how it obtains it's advantage I.e. it's workings. I think your question is wrong, no I'm not a politician.

Is it possible to demonstrate on an IPhone the workings of the 3 methods?\" I'm not sure the workings matter if what we all want to know is if the Methods give measurable real-world increase in mining reward or not. Most reputable mining pools have a performance dashboard which reports the miner's hash rate achieved and reward received, among other metrics. Typically these measures can be viewed as line charts, so you can see how those measures perform over time and in comparison to other metrics. If QBT have their Methods in a mining pool, they could easily view the performance dashboard of their miners on any device, including an iPhone. QBT should have 2 identical miners (or sets of miners), one with a Method and one without, and then publish the metrics of those two miners/sets. QBT could publish their bitcoin wallet address so that anyone can verify with a blockchain explorer that the rewards they claimed have been received have indeed been received into the bitcoin wallet. If QBT do that, and if the results show a statistically significant difference in rewards between the 2 miners/sets, then my view is that a substantial re-rate would follow.",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

A rollout is usually when you're deploying to multiple targets - but we know from the 8 April 2025 RNS that only 1 company was involved in testing Method C. Although when rolling out an ASIC there are a number of testing steps along the way before fabrication. So I suppose you could say that Method C design was \"rolled out\" to that NDA signatory. But we know from the 5 Dec 2025 RNS that implenenting Method C as an ASIC has been put on the back-burner. Because this Method C ASIC rollout did NOT result in the ASIC project continuing, there is no other way to say this: The Method C ASIC rollout was a failure.",

Everyone has noticed that QBT do this a lot - they announce a goal, then move the goalposts, and the goal is quietly forgotten about. Many of the positive investors get excited when the goalposts are moved because they think that there is now yet another goal to add to the expected mountain of revenue; and that if we don't hear about how a thing is progressing then the Company must be working hard on it. Thank you, Mikeydj, for reminding investors that when QBT stop mentioning a goal, then it is a strong indication that the goal has been abandoned.",

Namely: Can a vortex be quantified when OldSharedog\u2019s oars pull through the water? Now, some of you may say, \u201cRevd, that\u2019s not science, that\u2019s just you splashing about again.\u201d But I say unto you: where others see splashing, the faithful see data. For when the Revd dips his mighty oars into the lake, the waters do not merely part \u2014 they swirl, they spin, they form vortices of such complexity that even the QBT algorithm pauses, strokes its metaphorical beard, and says, \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s non\u2011linear.\u201d And so the question arises: Can the vortex be measured? Can the turbulence be charted? Can the swirl be quantified in a way that satisfies both physics and the QBT forum on a Sunday morning? My children, the answer is simple: Only if the share price stops bobbing long enough for anyone to get a reading. For the vortex is like the market: \u2022 \tIt spins when you expect calm. \u2022 \tIt calms when you expect spin. \u2022 \tAnd just when you think you\u2019ve modelled it, OldSharedog rows past and ruins the dataset. Some say the vortex represents uncertainty. Others say it represents opportunity. But the Revd says: It represents the exact moment you realise you should\u2019ve bought more at 0.7p. Let us therefore embrace the vortex \u2014 not as a problem to be solved, but as a sign of movement, momentum, and the occasional splash in the face. Go forth this week with faith, humour, and a towel. Amen, and pass the oars. DOG BLESS YOU ALL.",

I disagree with Mikeydj's assertion that QBT are not required to issue an RNS to advise of a project being abandoned. When investors have been built up by the company to expect significant revenue from the project, then many investors might ferl that to abandon the project is specific price-sensitive information, and must be disclosed as soon as possible. P.S. Does QBT not have the ability and resources to work on multiple projects simultaneously? I'm sure Gardin was boasting about this in previous interviews, or it might be on the website. A team of 20 experts rings a bell. If QBT are no longer able to work on multiple projects concurrently then one possible reason is a reduction in the number of people working for them.",

I said the RNS is clear about what the company is currently reporting progress on, that is not the same as declaring other work cancelled. An RNS reports material developments, not a full internal project status list. Companies are not required to issue an RNS just because a workstream is paused, deprioritised, or folded into other activity. They are required to RNS if something materially changes the company\u2019s prospects, such as formal cancellation, disposal, or write-off. If SaaS (or any other project) were formally abandoned and written off after being presented as revenue-generating, then yes, that would likely be price-sensitive and require disclosure. But no update does not equal abandonment. That\u2019s your inference, not a regulatory fact. On resources: yes, QBT has said it can run multiple R&D tracks in parallel. That still doesn\u2019t mean every strand is externally reportable at all times, or that timelines won\u2019t change as technical and partner work dictates. R&D focus shifts constantly without implying staff cuts or project failure. So the real difference here is simple: You are treating silence as evidence and being misleading to the readers of this forum I\u2019m saying only disclosed decisions are evidence, which is the only thing that can be relied on. An unimpressive  Usersteve post is not evidence. Until there is an RNS saying a project is cancelled, sold, or written off, calling it \u201cabandoned\u201d is opinion, not fact. Shouting it from the rooftops across multiple forums under the guise of various usernames is dishonest and abhorrent",

Since 2024, RNS updates have consistently shifted away from: \u2022 cloud-based optimisation (Methods A & B via SaaS) towards: \u2022 hardware-level integration (Method C) \u2022 then software integrated directly into mining firmware That is a strategic pivot, not the same thing as a declared project termination. Regulatory disclosure is triggered by material financial impact or asset write-off, not by internal reprioritisation of R&D routes. Companies do this all the time without issuing \u201cProject X is dead\u201d announcements. So to be clear: \u2022 I\u2019m not saying SaaS was formally cancelled via RNS \u2022 I am saying it has not been pursued as the commercial route for some time \u2022 And that conclusion is based on what the company has actually reported working on since That\u2019s very different from claiming the company is secretly binning projects or misleading investors \u2014 which is what some posts are implying without evidence.

These two caveats make it explicit that all QBT are reporting is the belief or gut feeling of the Board; they are not reporting any independently verified confirmation that any of the Methods work. The second caveat (\"have the potential\") is also a reminder that even if the Methods work as claimed, then QBT are explicitly advising investors that there still is only a potential to \"transform the economics of Bitcoin mining by improving performance\". In other words, QBT's goal still might not happen. In summary, the quote you selected is a very good reminder that QBT's Methods are highly speculative and not at all guaranteed to be successful in generating revenue. This should come as no surprise - this is an AIM company, after all. Throughout its 25-year history QBT has not achieved any significant sustained revenue or profit, so it is my view that for them to do so now will require a lot more than mere blurbs of belief and pontification of potential from the Board.",

But there are a few important points you\u2019re glossing over. First, on \u201cALL assets\u201d: SaaS was originally a commercial delivery route for Methods A & B, not a separate core technology asset in its own right. Once the company pivoted to Method C (as per last RNS) and to working directly with hardware partners, the relevance of SaaS as a standalone product route obviously has seemingly  diminished. That doesn\u2019t mean the underlying IP vanished \u2014 it means the route to market changed. Second, on verification: You\u2019re right that the RNS does not claim independent commercial validation yet.

Third, on \u201cpotential\u201d: Every pre-revenue tech company on AIM uses exactly that language until contracts are signed.

As for your guess  at my \u00a35,000 investment, the size of my stake is irrelevant to the factual discussion. It reflects my personal risk allocation, not an assertion that the company will succeed or fail.

          "content": "Awl007 said \"Fact 5. Method b now north of 10% improvement.\" Happy New Year to you. Unfortunately the performance of Method B is far from clear. Looking at the RNSs, the most recent mention I found is way back in 10 May 2023 which states: \"The test results show that QBT\u2019s algorithm, known as Method B, has *theoretically* increased the rate of successful bitcoin mining by 2.6 times...\" https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/QBT/bitcoin-mining-update-fptgftoli10f08h.html So that RNS does not even claim their rest results gave a 2.6 times improvement; only that the increase was theoretical. If we go even further back, the 15 November 2022 RNS states: \"Preliminary results of Machine Learning Method \u201cB\u201d indicating 30% improvement over commercially available ASIC chip-based miners.\" https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/QBT/update-on-bitcoin-rd-cuytjnxqper351j.html So the 30% preliminary result increased to a 160% theoretical result. Regarding the \"north of 10%\" bit, this performance result does not appear in any RNS at all. It was merely mumbled as an aside in one of Gardin's interviews. So as MikeyDj suggests, best to disregard any interviews and just use RNSs for facts. In the 24 Jun 2025 final results RNS it states: \"With regards to Method B, the Company commenced real-time mining tests using the same ASIC chip used in the latest version of the most powerful Bitcoin mining rigs available.\" No RNS provides the test results. In fact, the three RNSs after the final results which contain updates on the R&D (24 Sep, 12 Nov, and 5 Dec 2025) all contain no results of Method B testing. However, those RNSs focus on Method C software. If we follow MikeyDj's advice, then this pivot towards Method C software and no update on Method B can be interpreted as Method B being de-prioritised or abandoned. So, the facts from Method B's performance is: it changes a lot; only theoretical or lab results; real-world results not published; likely has been shelved. My gut feeling is that the test results obtained from the ASIC manufacturers were so poor that they withdrew from the process, and QBT decided to pursue a different route.",

To my knowledge QBT have never announced mining an actual block Bitcoin and using 2 FPGA systems they are very unlikely to do so. We are led to believe the Methods increase the chances of finding the block winning hash but Increasing a miniscule probability still makes it incredibly unlikely. \"Increasing the probability of finding the block Bitcoin winning hash by 2.6 times ...\"  is more like what they should be claiming. From memory the only thing they have actually claimed is a few Satoshi from a mining pool. Since they are mining in a pool the improved performance of a single FPGA miner in the pool would be negligee. I'll leave the maths to a statistician to determine how long you would have to mine before you could claim better results by using one FPGA rig + Method.  Of course there would be many provisos involved. Finding Share hashes could be considered successful bitcoin mining!!",

First of all the word 'discussion' surely Gardin can't mean 'we are in discussion this very moment\" ?? So then we could ask how often ? Is it face to face talks  ? Zoom discussions? An exchange of emails ? Who are 'we'? What is being discussed? A single communication  between CEOs, engineers or sales team could be defined as discussions if it ended with \"I'll let you know\" Of course the word 'big' itself is open to wild speculation. The point of this ramble is language and it's misuse is endemic. I've said here, over the years, \"communication- the work of the devil\" . Virtually every statement made by Gardin can be analysed to the death and many interpretations deduced. Your ideal of dealing with 'facts' is simply not easy to follow in practise.

Where we differ is here: \u2022 Interpretation is inevitable \u2022 But inference is not the same as fact When an RNS says \u201cin discussion with a large ASIC manufacturer\u201d, the fact is that discussions have occurred. Anything beyond that \u2014 frequency, depth, outcome, or likelihood of success \u2014 is interpretation. Some interpretations may later prove correct, others not, but they remain speculative until confirmed. That isn\u2019t \u201cmy philosophy of facts\u201d, it\u2019s simply how regulated disclosure works.

Is it possible to demonstrate on an IPhone the workings of the 3 methods?\" I'm not sure the workings matter if what we all want to know is if the Methods give measurable real-world increase in mining reward or not. Most reputable mining pools have a performance dashboard which reports the miner's hash rate achieved and reward received, among other metrics. Typically these measures can be viewed as line charts, so you can see how those measures perform over time and in comparison to other metrics. If QBT have their Methods in a mining pool, they could easily view the performance dashboard of their miners on any device, including an iPhone. QBT should have 2 identical miners (or sets of miners), one with a Method and one without, and then publish the metrics of those two miners/sets. QBT could publish their bitcoin wallet address so that anyone can verify with a blockchain explorer that the rewards they claimed have been received have indeed been received into the bitcoin wallet. If QBT do that, and if the results show a statistically significant difference in rewards between the 2 miners/sets, then my view is that a substantial re-rate would follow.",

In terms of a business arrangement, there are two parties involved in this thread 1.  QBT would be the first party 2. The second parties I.e. the 3 ASIC manufacturers subject to a NDA and who have also built their own mining rigs. The same rigs that QBT is supposedly installing their software on. It is assumed each arrangement has a seperate set of terms. It isn't semantics, there are only first and multiple second parties involved here.  It is a convention to describe the concerned parties so. Invent your own definitions if you wish but you may find it difficult communicating with the rest of the English speaking world.

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny.

What you are describing is your reconstruction of how Method C must have evolved, based on your current understanding of mining architecture. That is not the same thing as demonstrating a contradiction in disclosed statements. Two points matter here: Change of implementation detail is not a contradiction of claim The core claim has remained that an AI-driven oracle can influence which work is prioritised or discarded before full hashing. Whether that logic sits on an ASIC, FPGA, control board, or software layer  is an implementation choice, not a reversal of principle. R&D projects routinely move functionality across layers as constraints are better understood. You are explicitly speculating about motives and competence Phrases like \u201cI speculate that Gardin finally realised\u2026\u201d and \u201cignorance rather than development\u201d are interpretations, not facts. You may believe them to be likely, but they are not supported by any evidence stating \u201cthis approach was abandoned because we misunderstood mining\u201d. Your three-stage description of mining is broadly accepted,  but it doesn\u2019t prove that earlier descriptions were false, only that you believe they were inefficient or unnecessary. Inefficiency is not  impossibility, and refinement not  cover-up. So we\u2019re back at the same distinction: You are arguing that evolving technical descriptions imply incompetence. I am saying that, absent of a disclosed contradiction, that conclusion is not established fact, yet you claim it fact in an authoritative manner, without context of how and why  we are expected to give you credit, or even benefit of doubt.  Why would i buy double glazing of a person off a person who cannot quantify their technical knowledge and authoritative views  of the products. Readers can decide which interpretation they find more persuasive , but it\u2019s important to be clear about where disclosure ends and inference begins.",

I don't think that is in dispute, go read several RNS and listen to interviews. My observation is, that was incorrect. Why was that? Because Gardin didn't understand the hashing/mining process. This at odds with his admissions of having a team of around 20 experts working for him. As I have explained creating headers to be hashed by a 1 TH/s miner should be possible but the time to evaluate each new header is unknown. Note by headers I mean modification of the header template provided by the pool by changing the Merkle root (as the extra-NONCE) but before it is sent to the ASIC I speculate that Gardin finally realised how hashing was being performed by the ASIC and realised that an Oracle on an ASIC was not necessary. To be clear hashing of the header can be divided into 3 basic stages 1.  Assemble the header from the information supplied by the pool, there is only one supplied. Performed by.  the control system 2. Send to ASIC and hash with  4.3 billion different NONCEs. If no result 3. Change Merkle root to create new variation of the original header, again performed by control system and repeat. My conclusion from the above: The story has changed it changed because of ignorance rather than development but you can spin it as development if you wish. But without doubt you have to ask the question, where was the expertise when this ASIC/FPGA scheme was being developed when any amateur miner could have probably told Gardin how mining worked. It also complements the fiasco with the CGMiner software.",

He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !\" You a tually consider this a 'technical conclusion' ? I'm assuming you think its technical because of the text 4.3 Billion NONCES - 1 TH/s hasher - 8.3 Ms and microprocessor Bizzare. Truly Bizarre please Google these terms to aid your understanding",

You are saying the template is evaluated as a job lot but still it is  instances are being discarded  I.e. identical to the hardware method. Common sense tells us we would expect both forms of Method C to operate similarly. The difference is Gardin said initially that an ASIC was needed because the Oracle had to match the ASIC throughput.  This was incorrect, it is feasible that a microprocessor can hash a new Merkle root and evaluate the resulting altered template during the time the current Merkle root template is being hashed 4.3 billion times. So Gardin and his team of so called experts didn't understand the process",

          "content": "This is a classic example of conclusion-first reasoning wrapped in technical verbosity. A few key points for readers: Header vs instance is being deliberately collapsed The post repeatedly asserts that a \u201cheader\u201d and an \u201cinstance of a header\u201d are the same thing. They are not used interchangeably in QBT\u2019s disclosures. Instances refer to nonce-variant hash attempts. Header assessment refers to evaluating block templates / header states before committing full ASIC hash cycles. Re-labelling them as identical is the author\u2019s interpretation, not a fact established by QBT or the RNS. Throughput arguments miss the architectural claim The argument assumes the Oracle must compete with ASIC throughput on a like-for-like basis. That is not what Method C claims. The claim is probabilistic pre-selection, not brute-force substitution. Saying \u201cASICs are faster\u201d is irrelevant if the process being described is filtering, not hashing. \u201cHe changed the story\u201d is assertion, not evidence What\u2019s actually happened is an evolution from hardware to software description as different implementations are explored. That is explicitly disclosed. No evidence is provided that anything has been \u201ccovered up\u201d ,only that the author now disagrees with the interpretation. Speculation is being presented as forensic conclusion Phrases like \u201cwe deduce\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d, and \u201cGardin didn\u2019t understand\u201d are opinion, not fact \u2014 yet they are framed as definitive findings. In short, this post does not introduce new information. It repackages a negative conclusion using technical language, relies on disputed definitions, and then treats those disputes as proof of failure. Readers can decide whether that advances understanding , or simply reinforces a predetermined narrative.",

To make a sizeable return a big investor would have to buy 100's of millions of shares and although that would send the price rocketing the investor would likely lose on the trade. In December the total value of trades was \u00a3426,000 for 60 Million shares traded, hardly worth trading for big money in view of the lack of volume buyers. https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/QBT/quantum-blockchain-technologies-plc/trade-recap",

          "content": "Method C software running on the operating system of the miner performs real time assessment of different headers, we are told by the web site.  The first puzzle is what does Gardin mean by different headers. The header template provided by the pool forms the core of the header to be hashed. Most fields are immutable but 2 fields are very important and mutable, the Merkle root and the 32-bit NONCE field. To form different headers these fields are changed to produce trillions of slightly different headers.  The NONCE field has one job, to cycle or increment from 0 to 4.3 billion. For a 1 TH/s miner this takes 8.6 ms, a mere blink of an eye. Every time a single bit changes in the Merkle root the NONCE cycles through 4.3 billion values for that variation of the header. Of course for multi chip ASIC rigs  the time drops equivalently, the latest mining rigs  can achieve 1,000 TH/s so will cycle the NONCE in 8.6 microseconds. What happens to the header after assessment by the Oracle is complete?  We know the answer to that \u201c this approach avoids processing a large number of headers which have little, or no probability to generate a hash above the pool target\u201d In other words that header is discarded and is not hashed, as we have been led to believe from previous descriptions of Method C.  How is this different from the brute force approach using \u201cinstances of Headers\u201d ? Again from the web site description \u201c Unlike current standard BTC mining approach, based on a search, where the mining rig runs as many Tera hashes per second as possible, during the circa\u201d 10 minutes allowance for each block, with no special criteria on which instances of the header to process first, also described as brute force\u201d We deduce that an instance of a header is simply a specific header, what at one time was called an input to SHA256. Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !",

Thanks for confirming. And no I\u2019m not saying \u2018deliverables\u2019 equates to \u2018commercial delivered / revenue\u2019 - just yet another of your truth bending interpretations.  In my mind all they would need to be classed as a \u2018deliverable\u2019 is a working prototype - precisely one of the things you claim but cannot prove. Sorry my posts seem too infrequent to you - sounds like you think I should be posting more???",

It seems that QBT are now doing something very different from thier prospectus. \"Reasons for listing: The purpose of the Placing is to raise funds to invest in and develop further innovative concepts which the Directors believe can become successful commercial enterprises. Funds are also required to continue to raise the level of in-house expertise and to look at initiatives to build the Brainspark brand outside the UK, particularly in continental Europe.\" Hmm. That does not seem to have gine very well. Maybe tbey need another 25 years? \"Dividends: The Company is seeking primarily to achieve capital growth for its shareholders. It is not the present intention of the Directors to pay a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.\" Have shareholders been rewarded with capital growth? When listed, the shares were 125p.

Under the accrual accounting method\u2014the standard for most mid-to-large businesses and public companies\u2014revenue is recognized when it is earned, which occurs at the moment of delivery, regardless of when the customer actually pays. Revenue Recognition Principles The relationship between delivery and revenue is governed by the Revenue Recognition Principle (standardized internationally as IFRS 15 and in the U.S. as ASC 606). These standards state that revenue is recognized when a company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer. Product Delivery: Revenue is typically recognized at a single point in time when physical possession or legal title transfers to the buyer. Service Delivery: Revenue is often recognized over time as the service is performed. For example, a monthly subscription service generates revenue incrementally each day the service is available to the user\"",

I'm curious to know why anyone still believes that QBT's business model will lead to anything commercially viable? Am I wrong in saying that the company has released a series of varying narratives over the years, but no evidence of any real substantive progress? You've had Method's A, B, C, SAAS, ASIC development and Quantum, with commercialisation usually touted to arrive in the following year, but then it all goes quiet before a new narrative comes out. I'm not saying QBT aren't trying to achieve their commercial goals, but are those goals viable on their budget? How many registered employee's does the company have? Are the researchers and developers just working on the projects in their spare time, more like hobbyists who might reap future reward? My view is that the miners who spend Billions building datacenters and filling them with rigs, likely have far larger budgets to develop their own proprietary software and systems to enhance their mining operations, and protect the secrecy of their systems to maintain advantage over competitors. Something else to consider is that with each halving mining profits reduce and Datacenters are likely to move operations away from mining and into AI. I've always believed that Bitcoin is built on false narratives and will eventually fail for whatever reason. Maybe power hungry AI will displace Crypto mining as the next big thing, since AI appears to be the next big thing to bubble up; I can see how AI is useful, whereas I view Bitcoin as useless. Will AI finally kill Bitcoin? Maybe. AI is as power hungry as BTC mining, the Datacenters will likely choose one over another dependent on ROI, I believe AI will win over BTC mining.",

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

The RNS most definitely did not say that they *will* produce an ASIC. But in the 3 Dec 2021 public interview, their CEO Gardin *did* say that QBT's target was to produce an ASIC that was, at a minumum, twice as fast as the keading ASIC at the time, within one year. His guidance is not caveated; these are stated as definites. Gardin states \"The chip that *we will produce*...\". This is definite guidance with no caveats, if, buts, mights, or maybes. Gardin also states the chip \"...will be more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip...\". Again, this is definite performance guidance with no caveats. Gardin also states \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\". Here the CEO is giving guidance that their target is to produce the ASIC in a year. No caveats at all. There are two ways to look at this. The first is to accept that QBT completely failed to achieve their guidance target stated publically by their CEO. The second is to accept that anything their CEOs say in public interviews is unreliable, may not reflect reality, and should not be used to influence your investment decisions.",

Here are some of Gardin's statements regarding the ASIC: At 03:05 Gardin says \"It was quite complex to be able to attract the attention of this large [5nm ASIC] manufacturer and actually being able to engage them and to book some production time at the beginning of Q1 2023\" At 04:14 Gardin says \"The chip that we will produce will be far more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip, but we are confident that it will be much, much faster when we introduce the results of the second patent\" and \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\" Then at 05:14 Gardin says \"We are getting extraordinary results from our AI team which means if we can incorporate those results into our chip, our chip could be 100 times, 1000 times faster.\" But as Mikeydj rightly posted, interviews are not guidance and can be disregarded. I would go further and will state the obvious: that after this debacle, all of Gardin's claims during interviews can be safely ignored as hopelessly fantastical delusions of grandeur which have never have and never will be borne out in the real world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyx67cydEMI",

Turns out Brewhaha contributed a lot of extremely well articulated criticisms of QBT and their Methods, made some astute observations, and raised some very relevant questions. So it seems that anyone who now criticises QBT is assumed to be Brewhaha. It is as if QBT's supporters cannot grasp that more than one person could possibly be critical of QBT *shrug*",

Usually it is difficult to determine exactly what technology they actually have and under what conditions or limits their claims are valid e.g. what references they use for measurement. Again, in general they claim many discussions are taking place but rarely do these discussions reach a conclusion or the results informed to shareholders. Many placings and consolidation take place and employees are minimal. In short everything is vague and difficult to pin down. I very much doubt I have ever called this a scam,",

It certainly doesn't mean I was mistake in thinking very few people here understand Bitcoin mining. As for reframing disagreement as ignorance, I'm not convinced  you trying to link disagreement through discussion and engagement to my observation of  investors ignorance is valid.  There is no disagreement with 'technical' speculation or inference simply because ignorance prevents the ignorant from disagreeing.More likely disagreement occurs for subjects where there is little ignorance but causal from differing variations and expectations in inference of  vague and poorly determined and presented factual content.

Lol wtf bob mined bitcoin ...jeez he must know abit more i guess...what a joke \"Appointment of Strategic AdviserFormer Intel Blockscale Executive Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focused on an R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jose Rios as Strategic Adviser. Mr. Rios is the former General Manager of Blockchain and Business Solutions in the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel Corp, where he spent 25 years. He was instrumental in the Blockscale ASIC project - Intel's dedicated chip for Bitcoin mining - and he brings extensive expertise in ASIC chip design, production and proprietary architecture development to QBT. Mr. Rios has been privately consulting for the Company since the latter part of 2023, and has now agreed to accept the position of Strategic Adviser. He has already played a pivotal role in forging key relationships with some of the leading players in the global Bitcoin industry and he has also provided strategic guidance on the market positioning of QBT's technology. Mr. Rios has actively assisted QBT at major industry events including, Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, Bitcoin Disrupt 2024 in Miami and Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, with plans to attend Amsterdam Bitcoin 2024. His close involvement with the Company will ensure QBT's growing recognition at the forefront of industry events and developments. Francesco Gardin, CEO and Chairman of QBT, commented: \"QBT was a keen supporter of Intel's Blockscale project, from the end 2022 to the early months of 2023, when the ASIC chip production was discontinued. Around that time, we were introduced to Mr Rios, its project manager and, following a period of mutual understanding into what QBT was looking to create, Jose initially agreed to consult for the Company in a private capacity. This has resulted in extremely valuable insights for QBT with regards to the Bitcoin industry, the major players in the sector and the analysis of key trends. \"Today's announcement that Mr Rios has agreed to become Strategic Adviser is an important step for us and one which we value very highly knowing the contribution he will bring to the Company.\" About Jose Rios:Mr. Rios, aged 51, is a seasoned technology executive with over two decades of experience in sales, engineering and product development within the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley. Jose has a strong background in custom silicon design, having overseen multiple high-performance computing projects across AI, automotive and blockchain sectors. His expertise spans from initial concept through to production, with a focus on optimising solutions for complex, data-intensive workloads.

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin? Your attacks on my posts revolve around, wordplay and semantics, literal meanings. definitions and phraseology. as if we are presenting evidence in a court of law.

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin?

What you are describing is your reconstruction of how Method C must have evolved, based on your current understanding of mining architecture. That is not the same thing as demonstrating a contradiction in disclosed statements. Two points matter here: Change of implementation detail is not a contradiction of claim The core claim has remained that an AI-driven oracle can influence which work is prioritised or discarded before full hashing. Whether that logic sits on an ASIC, FPGA, control board, or software layer  is an implementation choice, not a reversal of principle. R&D projects routinely move functionality across layers as constraints are better understood. You are explicitly speculating about motives and competence Phrases like \u201cI speculate that Gardin finally realised\u2026\u201d and \u201cignorance rather than development\u201d are interpretations, not facts. You may believe them to be likely, but they are not supported by any evidence stating \u201cthis approach was abandoned because we misunderstood mining\u201d. Your three-stage description of mining is broadly accepted,  but it doesn\u2019t prove that earlier descriptions were false, only that you believe they were inefficient or unnecessary. Inefficiency is not  impossibility, and refinement not  cover-up. So we\u2019re back at the same distinction: You are arguing that evolving technical descriptions imply incompetence. I am saying that, absent of a disclosed contradiction, that conclusion is not established fact, yet you claim it fact in an authoritative manner, without context of how and why  we are expected to give you credit, or even benefit of doubt.  Why would i buy double glazing of a person off a person who cannot quantify their technical knowledge and authoritative views  of the products. Readers can decide which interpretation they find more persuasive , but it\u2019s important to be clear about where disclosure ends and inference begins.",

I don't think that is in dispute, go read several RNS and listen to interviews. My observation is, that was incorrect. Why was that? Because Gardin didn't understand the hashing/mining process. This at odds with his admissions of having a team of around 20 experts working for him. As I have explained creating headers to be hashed by a 1 TH/s miner should be possible but the time to evaluate each new header is unknown. Note by headers I mean modification of the header template provided by the pool by changing the Merkle root (as the extra-NONCE) but before it is sent to the ASIC I speculate that Gardin finally realised how hashing was being performed by the ASIC and realised that an Oracle on an ASIC was not necessary. To be clear hashing of the header can be divided into 3 basic stages 1.  Assemble the header from the information supplied by the pool, there is only one supplied. Performed by.  the control system 2. Send to ASIC and hash with  4.3 billion different NONCEs. If no result 3. Change Merkle root to create new variation of the original header, again performed by control system and repeat. My conclusion from the above: The story has changed it changed because of ignorance rather than development but you can spin it as development if you wish. But without doubt you have to ask the question, where was the expertise when this ASIC/FPGA scheme was being developed when any amateur miner could have probably told Gardin how mining worked. It also complements the fiasco with the CGMiner software.",

Those are technical claims, whether you like the label or not. The issue isn\u2019t that you mention 4.3 billion nonces or TH/s. The issue is that you take a self-constructed interpretation of partial disclosures, layer assumptions on top, and then present the result as a definitive failure of the technology, while dismissing any alternative interpretation as \u201cword salad\u201d. That\u2019s not analysis; it\u2019s narrative certainty built on inference. You say \u201cGardin has continually changed the story\u201d, yet you haven\u2019t demonstrated a contradiction in the RNSs, only that your interpretation has shifted as new descriptions were released.

I'll just paste my conclusion here Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !\" You a tually consider this a 'technical conclusion' ? I'm assuming you think its technical because of the text 4.3 Billion NONCES - 1 TH/s hasher - 8.3 Ms and microprocessor Bizzare. Truly Bizarre please Google these terms to aid your understanding",

You are saying the template is evaluated as a job lot but still it is  instances are being discarded  I.e. identical to the hardware method. Common sense tells us we would expect both forms of Method C to operate similarly. The difference is Gardin said initially that an ASIC was needed because the Oracle had to match the ASIC throughput.  This was incorrect, it is feasible that a microprocessor can hash a new Merkle root and evaluate the resulting altered template during the time the current Merkle root template is being hashed 4.3 billion times. So Gardin and his team of so called experts didn't understand the process",

A few key points for readers: Header vs instance is being deliberately collapsed The post repeatedly asserts that a \u201cheader\u201d and an \u201cinstance of a header\u201d are the same thing. They are not used interchangeably in QBT\u2019s disclosures. Instances refer to nonce-variant hash attempts. Header assessment refers to evaluating block templates / header states before committing full ASIC hash cycles. Re-labelling them as identical is the author\u2019s interpretation, not a fact established by QBT or the RNS. Throughput arguments miss the architectural claim The argument assumes the Oracle must compete with ASIC throughput on a like-for-like basis. That is not what Method C claims. The claim is probabilistic pre-selection, not brute-force substitution. Saying \u201cASICs are faster\u201d is irrelevant if the process being described is filtering, not hashing. \u201cHe changed the story\u201d is assertion, not evidence What\u2019s actually happened is an evolution from hardware to software description as different implementations are explored. That is explicitly disclosed. No evidence is provided that anything has been \u201ccovered up\u201d ,only that the author now disagrees with the interpretation. Speculation is being presented as forensic conclusion Phrases like \u201cwe deduce\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d, and \u201cGardin didn\u2019t understand\u201d are opinion, not fact \u2014 yet they are framed as definitive findings. In short, this post does not introduce new information.

          "content": "Method C software running on the operating system of the miner performs real time assessment of different headers, we are told by the web site.  The first puzzle is what does Gardin mean by different headers. The header template provided by the pool forms the core of the header to be hashed. Most fields are immutable but 2 fields are very important and mutable, the Merkle root and the 32-bit NONCE field. To form different headers these fields are changed to produce trillions of slightly different headers.  The NONCE field has one job, to cycle or increment from 0 to 4.3 billion. For a 1 TH/s miner this takes 8.6 ms, a mere blink of an eye. Every time a single bit changes in the Merkle root the NONCE cycles through 4.3 billion values for that variation of the header. Of course for multi chip ASIC rigs  the time drops equivalently, the latest mining rigs  can achieve 1,000 TH/s so will cycle the NONCE in 8.6 microseconds. What happens to the header after assessment by the Oracle is complete?  We know the answer to that \u201c this approach avoids processing a large number of headers which have little, or no probability to generate a hash above the pool target\u201d In other words that header is discarded and is not hashed, as we have been led to believe from previous descriptions of Method C.  How is this different from the brute force approach using \u201cinstances of Headers\u201d ? Again from the web site description \u201c Unlike current standard BTC mining approach, based on a search, where the mining rig runs as many Tera hashes per second as possible, during the circa\u201d 10 minutes allowance for each block, with no special criteria on which instances of the header to process first, also described as brute force\u201d We deduce that an instance of a header is simply a specific header, what at one time was called an input to SHA256. Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !",

It seems that QBT are now doing something very different from thier prospectus. \"Reasons for listing: The purpose of the Placing is to raise funds to invest in and develop further innovative concepts which the Directors believe can become successful commercial enterprises. Funds are also required to continue to raise the level of in-house expertise and to look at initiatives to build the Brainspark brand outside the UK, particularly in continental Europe.\" Hmm. That does not seem to have gine very well. Maybe tbey need another 25 years? \"Dividends: The Company is seeking primarily to achieve capital growth for its shareholders. It is not the present intention of the Directors to pay a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.\" Have shareholders been rewarded with capital growth? When listed, the shares were 125p.

Under the accrual accounting method\u2014the standard for most mid-to-large businesses and public companies\u2014revenue is recognized when it is earned, which occurs at the moment of delivery, regardless of when the customer actually pays. Revenue Recognition Principles The relationship between delivery and revenue is governed by the Revenue Recognition Principle (standardized internationally as IFRS 15 and in the U.S. as ASC 606). These standards state that revenue is recognized when a company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer. Product Delivery: Revenue is typically recognized at a single point in time when physical possession or legal title transfers to the buyer. Service Delivery: Revenue is often recognized over time as the service is performed. For example, a monthly subscription service generates revenue incrementally each day the service is available to the user\"",

I'm curious to know why anyone still believes that QBT's business model will lead to anything commercially viable? Am I wrong in saying that the company has released a series of varying narratives over the years, but no evidence of any real substantive progress? You've had Method's A, B, C, SAAS, ASIC development and Quantum, with commercialisation usually touted to arrive in the following year, but then it all goes quiet before a new narrative comes out. I'm not saying QBT aren't trying to achieve their commercial goals, but are those goals viable on their budget? How many registered employee's does the company have? Are the researchers and developers just working on the projects in their spare time, more like hobbyists who might reap future reward? My view is that the miners who spend Billions building datacenters and filling them with rigs, likely have far larger budgets to develop their own proprietary software and systems to enhance their mining operations, and protect the secrecy of their systems to maintain advantage over competitors. Something else to consider is that with each halving mining profits reduce and Datacenters are likely to move operations away from mining and into AI. I've always believed that Bitcoin is built on false narratives and will eventually fail for whatever reason. Maybe power hungry AI will displace Crypto mining as the next big thing, since AI appears to be the next big thing to bubble up; I can see how AI is useful, whereas I view Bitcoin as useless. Will AI finally kill Bitcoin? Maybe. AI is as power hungry as BTC mining, the Datacenters will likely choose one over another dependent on ROI, I believe AI will win over BTC mining.",

In terms of a business arrangement, there are two parties involved in this thread 1.  QBT would be the first party 2. The second parties I.e. the 3 ASIC manufacturers subject to a NDA and who have also built their own mining rigs. The same rigs that QBT is supposedly installing their software on. It is assumed each arrangement has a seperate set of terms. It isn't semantics, there are only first and multiple second parties involved here.  It is a convention to describe the concerned parties so. Invent your own definitions if you wish but you may find it difficult communicating with the rest of the English speaking world.

There is no third party in that relationship. Perhaps you could provide a link to a website that has a definition of \"third party\" that supports your position?",

          "content": "RNS 30 November 2021. How many of you were enticed to buy in based upon this exciting news ??? An ASIC expected to to be twice as fast !!  What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

These discussions were focused on the timing for the delivery of both hardware and software from these potential customers and commercial partners. It should be noted that partial access to source code has already been granted to the Company.\nThe Company also held in-depth discussions with other key Bitcoin industry players who were present. These meetings were made possible as QBT is now being perceived and recognised by the industry as a forerunner in the use of AI technology being applied to SHA-256 optimisation, i.e., the core algorithm for Bitcoin mining.\nDuring the same event, the 256 Foundation, whose stated mission is to\n\u201c\nDismantle the proprietary mining empire to make Bitcoin and freedom tech\nnology accessible to anyone\u201d presented a working \u2018open source\u2019 real-time mining system, using three EmberOne hashing boards, comprising 36 ASICs in total.\nThis launch represented the first implementation of a Bitcoin-mining stack, i.e., a complete open software and hardware publicly available design made from the following open-source components:\nHashing board (EmberOne),\nControl board\n(Libre Board),\nFirmware (Mujina), and a\nMining Pool (HydraPool)\nThis is a significant milestone for the Bitcoin industry as it finally opens access for any system designer to assemble a complete mining rig, using an open-source framework which is readily accessible. This differs radically from the current industrial model of existing Bitcoin mining systems which comprises of a closed \u2018black-box\u2019 hardware / software, mainly to protect the products of the rig manufacturers and which has historically delayed the development of the sector, due to the need to reverse engineer existing chips or, by needing to develop an entire hardware / software Bitcoin mining system.\nThe Company, through its US consultants, maintains excellent relations with key 256 Foundation members.\nQBT is, therefore, allocating part of its existing resources to master all elements of the 256 Foundation Bitcoin-mining stack, in order to quickly implement its Methods onto this breakthrough environment, when new mining rigs are launched by system integrators later this year.\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman of QBT, commented\n, \u201cWe are now entering our fourth year of attending US Bitcoin mining events. Bitcoin Park, which we have attended since 2024, provides QBT with the necessary visibility in the sector to all the most important players which represent QBT\u2019s potential future partners and clients.\n\u201cThe central role played by the US Bitcoin community in the development of this growing crypto ecosystem is unique, hence our constant presence at US-based events like this one.\n\u201cQBT\u2019s adoption of the 265 Foundation Bitcoin mining stack as one of the reference development environments for its three Methods adds an additional target platform totally independent from specific manufacturers. While we will continue to work with those ASIC designers and Bitcoin miners in order to develop a collaborative partnership for our Methods, we welcome the 256 Foundation\u2019s open-source attitude as fundamental towards the development of much needed standards for Bitcoin mining-rig development.\u201d\nFor further information please contact:\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\n+39 335 296573\nFrancesco Gardin, CEO and Executive Chairman\nSP Angel Corporate Finance\n(Nominated Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nJeff Keating\nLeander\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 7795 168 157\nChristian Taylor-Wilkinson\nAbout Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications.

The companies become simply pump and dumps. Gamblers trying to make a quick fast buck. Long term holders diluted then consolidated until their holding is worthless and not worth selling. This looks like a great target for the P&D now. I think most genuine investors now realise thoughts of great wealth are not realistic.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction.

And just a few hours later the interview came out addressing tge confusion this statement caused. So, within a few hours after the 7am publication,  presumably QBT received several calls to clarify this statement, and were able to include addressing the issue in the interview. All within a few hours. Quite impressive, really. If only QBT responded to calls for clarification in this manner on a regular basis!!",

In the same period QBT's share price has dropped 17% from 0.63p to 0.525p When bitcoin did a 6-bagger, QBT fell. When bitcoin halved in value, QBT fell. Thus there is no relationship between BTC and QBT prices. To me, this strongly suggests that the market knows that QBT is not related to BTC. Rather, the market knows that QBT is oprtating in another area. QBT's spikes have been on the back of hopeful RNSs, all of which failed to result in deals and revenue. So it seems to me that QBT's main 'product' is hope itself, which it sellsto the market by way of fundraises. And this hope is often hyped by Gardin during interviews. Just my take on things. Will happily be proved wrong by the announcement of a material commercial deal, or by the publishing of validation of QBT's Methods by an trusted independent company (such as one of the Big 4)  or reputable newspaper (such as The Financial Times or Computer Weekly).",

I called this yesterday, as many others have, the market isn't interested in progress or potential. Appreciate his first language isn't English, but the interview was also a car crash. The arrogance and his patronising manner at the end of the interview was not good! The FACT is if you're a going to post videos at the beginning of 2024 stating revenue this year and then do it again a year later and still nothing, what do you think would happen? Another FACT is, there are no signed deals or progress reports with respected ASIC chip manufacturers. The NDAs route aren't going to increase the SP - the market isn't stupid. I don't understand what they need to protect? Surely knowing who they're talking to would help their cause with investors? I see this falling below 0.0050p very soon. Might invest \u00a3500 if it falls below 0.0030p.",

So this is creating a new, entirely new situation in the sector. Finally you have chips available in quantities, and you have already have the entire design of a system, of, of, a, a, an ecosystem for mining, and this is for us is a game-changer because we expect, or the industry expect, that there will be many manufacturers who will assemble systems, starting from this open source designs, and therefore there will be more companies offering their systems, which will bring a very healthy change in this market dominated by 99% by the three manufacturers in China. Host: Francesco, there's been confusion around partial access to source code. Can you explain in simple terms what access QBT has today, and what it doesn't yet have? Gardin: Yeah, that's has to do with the three, ahh, umm, with three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, because there is substantial amount of source code and they start to release it to us, err, umm, partially, er, because, er, erm, we wouldn't have anyway the, the ability to deal with three, err, different operating system [sic], ahh, three different drivers, and so that's something that is going on incrementally, err, but, ahh, it's, it's part of, of an agreed, ahh, erm, path, er, that, er, we have, er, defined with this, er, three potential partners. Host: Mmm. I mean, ahh, investors are keen to understand progress with those partners. How would you describe the current stage of those relationships and why the phase is taking time? Gardin: Ahhh, well, I mean *laughs* the, say that, ahh, the main focus with the three manufacturers, but not the only but main work focus is Method C. Method C you need to train the neural network [sic] and train it on the specific ASICs that will be in the machine. So the training is very ASIC oriented, specific ASIC oriented, and that's not something you do overnight, and to get these machines there is legal paperwork because one thing is to sign an NDA, the other thing is to sign all the guarantees for the software, the proprietary software that they share, the design of this ASIC because we need to understand how they work internally, the specs of these ASICs which are not necessarily in the public domain, so, I mean, it's not as simple as I sign an NDA, I come and pick up a machine tomorrow. *laughs and shakes head* Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. Host: Francesco, hope you'll continue to keep us updated with your progress, thank you very much for your time today.

I'm joined by Francesco Gardin, the CEO of Quantum Blockchain Technologies. Francesco, very good to speak with you. Your update todays follows a positive industry conference rather than a single breakthrough. What was the key takeaway for QBT from attending the Nashville event? Gardin: Ok, good morning, Stephen. Ahh, the Bitcoin Park in Nashville is one of the center [sic] ah, in the US of the bitcoin culture. And so, ah, attending this events is always very important because it's the best way to network with the real professionals in the sector. Err, so it's been, ahh, one-and-a-half days but extremely intensive with the many, many, many, many side meetings that we had with the main players, especially with three, ahh, manufacturers of ASIC [sic] for bitcoin mining that we, ah, have signed the NDA with, and we are progressing, ahh, work with them, which is extremely good, and it's also good to show your face there and to show your physical presence together with our US consultants. Ahh, the, errm, so this is part of the normal commercial relationship, err, business relationship that you have to entertain and also monitor any development in the industry. Apart from this, it was very important for us also because one of the major problem that we had to face in the past is that 99% of the market is dominated by the Chinese manufacturers, and their policy is that no specs on the ASICs, err, and no availability of access to the software which runs on their mining rigs. Therefore that fact that now, finally, other after this gigantic effort, ahh, there is this whole stack available which is open source from the design of the hashing boards, design of control boards, the software which controls it, the even a pool, now is all open source which means that we can, ah, ah, as well as working with the three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, ...

Thus there are apparent inconsistencies between the RNSs and the public statements from the CEO.

          "content": "How Narratives Sometimes Form Worth remembering that forum sentiment doesn\u2019t always build randomly. There\u2019s a common pattern that appears across many AIM and small-cap boards and in particular this. RNS brings out droves. It usually starts with a strong negative or positive claim. Then follow-up posts repeat or reinforce it. Over time, repetition can make opinions feel like established facts, even when no new evidence has been added. You have seen this before right ? Another common tactic is presenting complex technical points in a way that suggests confusion or contradiction. Readers can mistake complexity for proof something is wrong. Examples of Common Posting Styles Seen Across Discussions: \u2022 Pedrobull \u2013 Often posts short, slogan-style negativity or repetition phrases that reinforce sentiment rather than introduce new information. \u2022 Phimx \u2013 Frequently posts longer technical or RNS-based interpretations, often highlighting perceived contradictions or uncertainty in company communications. \u2022 riceyboy84 \u2013 Commonly posts timeline predictions and worst-case scenario outcomes such as delisting or failure, usually framed as inevitability. \u2022 KoolKat15 \u2013 Often focuses on investor protection arguments, confidence issues, and the absence of revenue or deals, typically presented in detailed opinion posts. \u2022 allforprofit \u2013 Tends to use strong criticism of leadership capability or company direction, often framed as performance concern commentary. \u2022 0134 \u2013 Regularly raises concerns around funding, placings, or financial sustainability speculation. \u2022 Plutuq \u2013 Often posts probability or price prediction style commentary suggesting likely short-term trading outcomes. \u2022 Awl007 \u2013 Typically posts shorter reinforcement or agreement style comments that echo broader sentiment already expressed. \u2022 mrhanji \u2013 Usually posts bullish outlook commentary, often focusing on potential partnerships, future valuation upside, or encouraging holders to ignore negative sentiment. These observations relate to posting style patterns only and form part of normal forum debate dynamics seen across many shares and boards. But WHY so many self proclaimed uninvested users spreading negativity ? None of this means criticism or support is invalid. Healthy debate is important. It simply means investors should separate: \u2022 Evidence \u2022 Interpretation \u2022 Repetition \u2022 Emotion Always worth checking source material yourself rather than relying purely on forum consensus.",

QBT have to understand how the ASICs work internally. He goes onto say there is legal paperwork for the software and it's not as simple as signing a NDA and coming to pick up the machine tomorrow. It is confusing because we don't know if he's talking about the soft or hard Method C. We know fro. RNS 12 Nov 2025 \" the performance of this new software-only version is independent of the ASIC being used in the miner.\" So what on earth was this update about? PS: incidentally what was learned, after waffling in other RNS about the 10,000s of Chinese after market boards, which I believe was another one of his focal points for revenue, the Chinese were giving nothing away to enable any progress. No ASIC or software details. Obviously if the Chinese were actually approached, they had no interest in what Gardin had to offer.",

Unfortunately, for genuine shareholders this will never rise again IMO unless there is factual evidence of a deal/partnership/revenue. Shareholders had been promised revenue in 2024 and last year, and yet, it never came to fruition. Why is that you might ask? The reason is simple, there are no deals/partnerships/revenue now or for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, this will end in tears for all LTH's. The bullish sentiment from certain posters is plain false in my opinion and everyone should call this company out because even though many understand the risks involved, they've been told false information and it's wrong! You can't get away from the nonsense that has been released in RNSs, videos and interviews. This behaviour should be reported and the authorities should act again this misinformation.",

Discussions about delivering a few mining rigs and software. Doesn't Gardin know about DHL, UPS and FedEx. Why does fluff like this have to be in a RNS, it's routine for tens of thousands of companies each day. In the RNS 5 Dec 2025 Gardin said \" ... The process has reached the stage where these three companies will now be needing to make their mining rigs available to QBT's testing team at its laboratory in Milan, with access to their relevant source code...\" So here we are 2 months later and Gardin is supposedly still discussing delivery of miners and software from the NDA companies.

Hexam said \"... but the most bizarre thing in this weird RNS is that they say the conference gave the opportunity of 'allowing QBT\u2019s management team to engage with those ASIC manufacturers which have signed NDAs with the Company.'\" Very odd. It makes an image pop into my head of Gardin cornering an NDA signatory in the bar and repeatedly asking \"Have you sent us sime rigs yet, guv?\". But I agree with you - choosing to converse during conferences rather than via phone, video call. email, etc. strongly suggests they're just not that into QBT. Mind you, if the project only progresses after discussions every few months at bitcoin conferences, that could support the theory that this is a lifestyle company. Are those companies not answering QBT\u2019s call and emails? Why do they need a conference to engage with them?",

What\u2019s actually happening is simpler: QBT has been running an R&D programme with multiple approaches, descriptions have evolved as implementations are tested, progress has been slower than hoped (as is common in R&D), and outcomes ultimately depend on independent verification, not forum rhetoric. None of that proves success, but neither does repetition of negative narratives prove failure. The only things that will settle this are evidence, testing results, and disclosures.

The RNS most definitely did not say that they *will* produce an ASIC. But in the 3 Dec 2021 public interview, their CEO Gardin *did* say that QBT's target was to produce an ASIC that was, at a minumum, twice as fast as the keading ASIC at the time, within one year. His guidance is not caveated; these are stated as definites. Gardin states \"The chip that *we will produce*...\". This is definite guidance with no caveats, if, buts, mights, or maybes. Gardin also states the chip \"...will be more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip...\". Again, this is definite performance guidance with no caveats. Gardin also states \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\". Here the CEO is giving guidance that their target is to produce the ASIC in a year. No caveats at all. There are two ways to look at this. The first is to accept that QBT completely failed to achieve their guidance target stated publically by their CEO. The second is to accept that anything their CEOs say in public interviews is unreliable, may not reflect reality, and should not be used to influence your investment decisions.",

Investors would have got this impresdion from the public statements of CEO Gardin during the 3 Dec 2021 Proactive Investor interview (link at bottom). Here are some of Gardin's statements regarding the ASIC: At 03:05 Gardin says \"It was quite complex to be able to attract the attention of this large [5nm ASIC] manufacturer and actually being able to engage them and to book some production time at the beginning of Q1 2023\" At 04:14 Gardin says \"The chip that we will produce will be far more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip, but we are confident that it will be much, much faster when we introduce the results of the second patent\" and \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\" Then at 05:14 Gardin says \"We are getting extraordinary results from our AI team which means if we can incorporate those results into our chip, our chip could be 100 times, 1000 times faster.\" But as Mikeydj rightly posted, interviews are not guidance and can be disregarded. I would go further and will state the obvious: that after this debacle, all of Gardin's claims during interviews can be safely ignored as hopelessly fantastical delusions of grandeur which have never have and never will be borne out in the real world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyx67cydEMI",

I refer to these companies as having non-commercial projects. In general they have some semblance of a project to justify loosely what they make claims for. Usually it is difficult to determine exactly what technology they actually have and under what conditions or limits their claims are valid e.g. what references they use for measurement. Again, in general they claim many discussions are taking place but rarely do these discussions reach a conclusion or the results informed to shareholders. Many placings and consolidation take place and employees are minimal. In short everything is vague and difficult to pin down. I very much doubt I have ever called this a scam,",

It certainly doesn't mean I was mistake in thinking very few people here understand Bitcoin mining. As for reframing disagreement as ignorance, I'm not convinced  you trying to link disagreement through discussion and engagement to my observation of  investors ignorance is valid.  There is no disagreement with 'technical' speculation or inference simply because ignorance prevents the ignorant from disagreeing.More likely disagreement occurs for subjects where there is little ignorance but causal from differing variations and expectations in inference of  vague and poorly determined and presented factual content.

Lol wtf bob mined bitcoin ...jeez he must know abit more i guess...what a joke \"Appointment of Strategic AdviserFormer Intel Blockscale Executive Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focused on an R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jose Rios as Strategic Adviser. Mr. Rios is the former General Manager of Blockchain and Business Solutions in the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel Corp, where he spent 25 years. He was instrumental in the Blockscale ASIC project - Intel's dedicated chip for Bitcoin mining - and he brings extensive expertise in ASIC chip design, production and proprietary architecture development to QBT. Mr. Rios has been privately consulting for the Company since the latter part of 2023, and has now agreed to accept the position of Strategic Adviser. He has already played a pivotal role in forging key relationships with some of the leading players in the global Bitcoin industry and he has also provided strategic guidance on the market positioning of QBT's technology. Mr. Rios has actively assisted QBT at major industry events including, Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, Bitcoin Disrupt 2024 in Miami and Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, with plans to attend Amsterdam Bitcoin 2024. His close involvement with the Company will ensure QBT's growing recognition at the forefront of industry events and developments. Francesco Gardin, CEO and Chairman of QBT, commented: \"QBT was a keen supporter of Intel's Blockscale project, from the end 2022 to the early months of 2023, when the ASIC chip production was discontinued. Around that time, we were introduced to Mr Rios, its project manager and, following a period of mutual understanding into what QBT was looking to create, Jose initially agreed to consult for the Company in a private capacity. This has resulted in extremely valuable insights for QBT with regards to the Bitcoin industry, the major players in the sector and the analysis of key trends. \"Today's announcement that Mr Rios has agreed to become Strategic Adviser is an important step for us and one which we value very highly knowing the contribution he will bring to the Company.\" About Jose Rios:Mr. Rios, aged 51, is a seasoned technology executive with over two decades of experience in sales, engineering and product development within the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley. Jose has a strong background in custom silicon design, having overseen multiple high-performance computing projects across AI, automotive and blockchain sectors. His expertise spans from initial concept through to production, with a focus on optimising solutions for complex, data-intensive workloads.

I think my presentation establishes my path of reasoning which leads to my conclusion. It is based upon descriptions provided by QBT, the workings of Bitcoin mining and commonsense. You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin? Your attacks on my posts revolve around, wordplay and semantics, literal meanings. definitions and phraseology. as if we are presenting evidence in a court of law. Well sorry, I'm writing colloquially and at a reasonable speed and little time to correct my text. As you say people can decide for themselves. It's all in Gardin's hands !",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin?

What you are describing is your reconstruction of how Method C must have evolved, based on your current understanding of mining architecture. That is not the same thing as demonstrating a contradiction in disclosed statements. Two points matter here: Change of implementation detail is not a contradiction of claim The core claim has remained that an AI-driven oracle can influence which work is prioritised or discarded before full hashing. Whether that logic sits on an ASIC, FPGA, control board, or software layer  is an implementation choice, not a reversal of principle. R&D projects routinely move functionality across layers as constraints are better understood. You are explicitly speculating about motives and competence Phrases like \u201cI speculate that Gardin finally realised\u2026\u201d and \u201cignorance rather than development\u201d are interpretations, not facts. You may believe them to be likely, but they are not supported by any evidence stating \u201cthis approach was abandoned because we misunderstood mining\u201d. Your three-stage description of mining is broadly accepted,  but it doesn\u2019t prove that earlier descriptions were false, only that you believe they were inefficient or unnecessary. Inefficiency is not  impossibility, and refinement not  cover-up. So we\u2019re back at the same distinction: You are arguing that evolving technical descriptions imply incompetence. I am saying that, absent of a disclosed contradiction, that conclusion is not established fact, yet you claim it fact in an authoritative manner, without context of how and why  we are expected to give you credit, or even benefit of doubt.  Why would i buy double glazing of a person off a person who cannot quantify their technical knowledge and authoritative views  of the products. Readers can decide which interpretation they find more persuasive , but it\u2019s important to be clear about where disclosure ends and inference begins.",

I don't think that is in dispute, go read several RNS and listen to interviews. My observation is, that was incorrect. Why was that? Because Gardin didn't understand the hashing/mining process. This at odds with his admissions of having a team of around 20 experts working for him. As I have explained creating headers to be hashed by a 1 TH/s miner should be possible but the time to evaluate each new header is unknown. Note by headers I mean modification of the header template provided by the pool by changing the Merkle root (as the extra-NONCE) but before it is sent to the ASIC I speculate that Gardin finally realised how hashing was being performed by the ASIC and realised that an Oracle on an ASIC was not necessary. To be clear hashing of the header can be divided into 3 basic stages 1.  Assemble the header from the information supplied by the pool, there is only one supplied. Performed by.  the control system 2. Send to ASIC and hash with  4.3 billion different NONCEs. If no result 3. Change Merkle root to create new variation of the original header, again performed by control system and repeat. My conclusion from the above: The story has changed it changed because of ignorance rather than development but you can spin it as development if you wish. But without doubt you have to ask the question, where was the expertise when this ASIC/FPGA scheme was being developed when any amateur miner could have probably told Gardin how mining worked. It also complements the fiasco with the CGMiner software.",

He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !\" You a tually consider this a 'technical conclusion' ? I'm assuming you think its technical because of the text 4.3 Billion NONCES - 1 TH/s hasher - 8.3 Ms and microprocessor Bizzare. Truly Bizarre please Google these terms to aid your understanding",

You are saying the template is evaluated as a job lot but still it is  instances are being discarded  I.e. identical to the hardware method. Common sense tells us we would expect both forms of Method C to operate similarly. The difference is Gardin said initially that an ASIC was needed because the Oracle had to match the ASIC throughput.  This was incorrect, it is feasible that a microprocessor can hash a new Merkle root and evaluate the resulting altered template during the time the current Merkle root template is being hashed 4.3 billion times. So Gardin and his team of so called experts didn't understand the process",

          "content": "This is a classic example of conclusion-first reasoning wrapped in technical verbosity. A few key points for readers: Header vs instance is being deliberately collapsed The post repeatedly asserts that a \u201cheader\u201d and an \u201cinstance of a header\u201d are the same thing. They are not used interchangeably in QBT\u2019s disclosures. Instances refer to nonce-variant hash attempts. Header assessment refers to evaluating block templates / header states before committing full ASIC hash cycles. Re-labelling them as identical is the author\u2019s interpretation, not a fact established by QBT or the RNS. Throughput arguments miss the architectural claim The argument assumes the Oracle must compete with ASIC throughput on a like-for-like basis. That is not what Method C claims. The claim is probabilistic pre-selection, not brute-force substitution. Saying \u201cASICs are faster\u201d is irrelevant if the process being described is filtering, not hashing. \u201cHe changed the story\u201d is assertion, not evidence What\u2019s actually happened is an evolution from hardware to software description as different implementations are explored. That is explicitly disclosed. No evidence is provided that anything has been \u201ccovered up\u201d ,only that the author now disagrees with the interpretation. Speculation is being presented as forensic conclusion Phrases like \u201cwe deduce\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d, and \u201cGardin didn\u2019t understand\u201d are opinion, not fact \u2014 yet they are framed as definitive findings. In short, this post does not introduce new information. It repackages a negative conclusion using technical language, relies on disputed definitions, and then treats those disputes as proof of failure. Readers can decide whether that advances understanding , or simply reinforces a predetermined narrative.",

          "content": "Method C software running on the operating system of the miner performs real time assessment of different headers, we are told by the web site.  The first puzzle is what does Gardin mean by different headers. The header template provided by the pool forms the core of the header to be hashed. Most fields are immutable but 2 fields are very important and mutable, the Merkle root and the 32-bit NONCE field. To form different headers these fields are changed to produce trillions of slightly different headers.  The NONCE field has one job, to cycle or increment from 0 to 4.3 billion. For a 1 TH/s miner this takes 8.6 ms, a mere blink of an eye. Every time a single bit changes in the Merkle root the NONCE cycles through 4.3 billion values for that variation of the header. Of course for multi chip ASIC rigs  the time drops equivalently, the latest mining rigs  can achieve 1,000 TH/s so will cycle the NONCE in 8.6 microseconds. What happens to the header after assessment by the Oracle is complete?  We know the answer to that \u201c this approach avoids processing a large number of headers which have little, or no probability to generate a hash above the pool target\u201d In other words that header is discarded and is not hashed, as we have been led to believe from previous descriptions of Method C.  How is this different from the brute force approach using \u201cinstances of Headers\u201d ? Again from the web site description \u201c Unlike current standard BTC mining approach, based on a search, where the mining rig runs as many Tera hashes per second as possible, during the circa\u201d 10 minutes allowance for each block, with no special criteria on which instances of the header to process first, also described as brute force\u201d We deduce that an instance of a header is simply a specific header, what at one time was called an input to SHA256. Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !",

It seems that QBT are now doing something very different from thier prospectus. \"Reasons for listing: The purpose of the Placing is to raise funds to invest in and develop further innovative concepts which the Directors believe can become successful commercial enterprises. Funds are also required to continue to raise the level of in-house expertise and to look at initiatives to build the Brainspark brand outside the UK, particularly in continental Europe.\" Hmm. That does not seem to have gine very well. Maybe tbey need another 25 years? \"Dividends: The Company is seeking primarily to achieve capital growth for its shareholders. It is not the present intention of the Directors to pay a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.\" Have shareholders been rewarded with capital growth? When listed, the shares were 125p. Today they are 0.575p. That's a 99.54% loss. Hmm. https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/images/Brainspark_prospectus1.pdf",

Under the accrual accounting method\u2014the standard for most mid-to-large businesses and public companies\u2014revenue is recognized when it is earned, which occurs at the moment of delivery, regardless of when the customer actually pays. Revenue Recognition Principles The relationship between delivery and revenue is governed by the Revenue Recognition Principle (standardized internationally as IFRS 15 and in the U.S. as ASC 606). These standards state that revenue is recognized when a company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer. Product Delivery: Revenue is typically recognized at a single point in time when physical possession or legal title transfers to the buyer. Service Delivery: Revenue is often recognized over time as the service is performed. For example, a monthly subscription service generates revenue incrementally each day the service is available to the user\"",

What it has delivered and disclosed are patent filings, working prototypes, lab validation, and third-party testing programmes under NDA. Those are tangible deliverables in this phase of a technology lifecycle, whether you personally value them or not. Revenue generation comes after technical validation and partner integration. You know that, which is why \u201cno revenue yet\u201d gets recycled as a rhetorical endpoint rather than an analytical conclusion. If your claim is that R&D-stage delivery is meaningless unless revenue already exists, then the disagreement is philosophical, not factual. But that does not make the disclosures false, nor does it make the work \u201cundelivered\u201d. So the record is clear: delivery has occurred, commercialisation is pending. Readers can decide whether that risk profile suits them.",

I'm curious to know why anyone still believes that QBT's business model will lead to anything commercially viable? Am I wrong in saying that the company has released a series of varying narratives over the years, but no evidence of any real substantive progress? You've had Method's A, B, C, SAAS, ASIC development and Quantum, with commercialisation usually touted to arrive in the following year, but then it all goes quiet before a new narrative comes out. I'm not saying QBT aren't trying to achieve their commercial goals, but are those goals viable on their budget? How many registered employee's does the company have? Are the researchers and developers just working on the projects in their spare time, more like hobbyists who might reap future reward? My view is that the miners who spend Billions building datacenters and filling them with rigs, likely have far larger budgets to develop their own proprietary software and systems to enhance their mining operations, and protect the secrecy of their systems to maintain advantage over competitors. Something else to consider is that with each halving mining profits reduce and Datacenters are likely to move operations away from mining and into AI. I've always believed that Bitcoin is built on false narratives and will eventually fail for whatever reason. Maybe power hungry AI will displace Crypto mining as the next big thing, since AI appears to be the next big thing to bubble up; I can see how AI is useful, whereas I view Bitcoin as useless. Will AI finally kill Bitcoin? Maybe. AI is as power hungry as BTC mining, the Datacenters will likely choose one over another dependent on ROI, I believe AI will win over BTC mining.",

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

Here is the status of QBT's production timeline: Software Commercialization Phase: QBT is currently transitioning from R&D to commercial application, having entered into three Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with ASIC manufacturers to test its Method C AI Oracle on their mining rigs at its Milan laboratory. Live Testing (2026): As of Feb 2026, QBT reported progress on integrating its software with third-party hardware following meetings at the Nashville Energy & Mining Summit. Shift to Software Focus: QBT deprioritized a hardware-based chip in favor of a software-based approach (SaaS), which allows for a faster rollout, with commercialization expected \"later this year\". Operational Focus: The company is currently engaged in \"fine-tuning\" its algorithms, with CEO Francesco Gardin indicating that the company is on the verge of turning its technology into commercial products. While no specific \"launch date\" for mass production was given in the Feb 2026, the company is in the final phases of testing and transitioning toward active commercial deployment in the 2025-2026 cycle",

Everyone does it. But switching from extreme bullish conviction to extreme failure certainty while presenting both as \u201cfact\u201d raises serious credibility questions. Investors should ask themselves: \u2022 Was the original bullish certainty wrong? \u2022 Is the current bearish certainty evidence-based or emotionally driven? \u2022 Why is the same certainty language being used in opposite directions? \u2022 Is the goal discussion \u2014 or sentiment influence? This matters because newer investors often assume long-term posters are consistent, reliable or evidence-driven. Posting history here shows conviction has flipped 180\u00b0 while the communication style has stayed the same \u2014 strong certainty, emotive language, and persuasion framing. That is not balanced analysis. That is narrative positioning. Readers should be extremely cautious when any poster: \u2022 Presents opinion as fact \u2022 Uses absolute outcome language repeatedly \u2022 Shifts stance dramatically while maintaining certainty tone \u2022 Focuses on emotional reaction rather than verifiable data The safest investment decisions are always based on: \u2022 Official RNS disclosures \u2022 Verifiable technical or commercial milestones \u2022 Independent research \u2022 Not forum personalities or conviction strength Always review full posting history \u2014 not just current sentiment.",

But pretending recurring posting waves are just random discussion is increasingly hard to accept when the same usernames appear, using the same themes, at the same trigger points. Let\u2019s be blunt. Every RNS or interview release is followed by a near-identical sequence: \u2022 Immediate worst-case certainty posts (failure, insolvency, delisting, fraud suggestions) \u2022 Follow-up reinforcement posts comparing QBT to historic AIM failures \u2022 Long retrospective posts selectively quoting historic RNS lines to construct failure narratives \u2022 Additional posts reframing progress delays as proof of incompetence or deception \u2022 Short one-liners reinforcing \u201cconsensus negativity\u201d This is not new. It is predictable,repeated and reported. Calling the company a \u201cskeleton non commercial project\u201d is not fact \u2014 it is opinion. Stating opinion as inevitability repeatedly is narrative building, not analysis. Claiming AIM losses justify assuming failure here is also flawed logic. Risk exists across AIM. It is not evidence of outcome for any specific company. No issue with scepticism. The issue is when scepticism is presented as certainty and repeated until newer investors assume it is established truth. Readers should ask themselves: \u2022 Are new facts being introduced? \u2022 Or are historic statements being recycled to reinforce sentiment? \u2022 Are timelines being debated fairly or selectively? \u2022 Are posters invested or repeatedly focused on discouraging investment? Debate is healthy. Narrative campaigning is something different.",

Of course if you go to most other boards you will see the same words and phrases used. Not surprising really is it, everyone is using  the same language about the same subjects. The same characters exist and post with the same rang of skills and experience. There's the moronic one-liners \" this is going to explode on news\" etc. The poster that can't help but post disguised swear words, the insulted. Absolute fanatical believers and disbelievers. The 'expert' on the company and the opposite poster that knows nothing. So it goes on, pick a board and read it! Me, I'm not much for great conspiracies but AIM has been shown to be very misleading and created huge losses for private investors.  Therefore, I suspect there are people paid to push agendas here maybe and elsewhere but why pay when the British public do it for you and for free? Personally I post here without help or hindrance from anyone else. What I write are my own words using my own ideas. Very occasionally I cite AI text but like others, at least honest posters, I note the use of AI assisted posts. I think QBT is a skeleton non commercial project, fleshed out by vague and ambiguous RNS and open to huge interpretation of their meaning and importance. So ends my sermon!",

This is simply an observation of how certain discussions repeatedly develop on this board, particularly after RNS or interview releases. Readers may wish to watch how some usernames tend to interact and how narratives build in stages. riceyboy84 Often introduces strong certainty or worst-case outcome posts such as \u201cend game\u201d, insolvency, delisting or investigation themes. These posts frequently appear early and set a negative sentiment anchor. wyt3fr0g and occasionally Pedrobull Often follow with short reinforcement comments or comparisons to failed AIM companies. These tend to increase perceived consensus rather than introduce new information. Phimx Frequently then builds longer posts quoting RNS history, highlighting contradictions or delays, and directly challenges bullish posters. This often provides technical justification to earlier sentiment posts. Hexam Often reinforces technical or commercial plausibility concerns using conditional logic (for example questioning whether testing has worked or whether partners are engaged). This tends to add credibility to earlier sceptical arguments. UserSteve Regularly expands discussions into historical company performance, long-term revenue absence, and share price decline over many years. This often reframes current debate into a broader historic failure narrative. Plutuq Often reinforces investor frustration or timeline disappointment themes, particularly around delivery expectations versus results. Again, none of the above means any poster is correct or incorrect. It simply shows how forum sentiment can build through layered interaction between the same regular contributors. Readers may find it useful to separate: \u2022 Evidence in official disclosures \u2022 Interpretation of that evidence \u2022 Repetition of narratives \u2022 Emotional certainty language . Explore these users posting history (it reveals a lot) Always worth forming your own view based on primary company information rather than thread momentum. Just sharing as an observation for awareness, particularly for newer investors who may not have seen how these discussion cycles tend to repeat.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction. IP Strategy: QBT is focusing on patenting its core AI Oracle technology, though some developments are kept as trade secrets. The company describes this period as a \"very, very intense and busy\" time as they move towards full commercialization of their proprietary AI, which aims to boost hashing power without requiring significant extra energy.",

You will see the chart shows the share price has fallen from 30,500p (in April 2000) to 0.53p today. mrhanji said \"What we should be focused on is the rns and the developments over the past couple of years..\" Better still, we should look at all the RNSs. It is no secret that there is no RNS in the company's 26-year history that announces a commercial product, or any significant and sustained revenue. Every commercial project appears to have failed, and the company constantly changes to another project. It seems perfectly obvious to me that this explains the monumental erosion of value.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction. IP Strategy: QBT is focusing on patenting its core AI Oracle technology, though some developments are kept as trade secrets. The company describes this period as a \"very, very intense and busy\" time as they move towards full commercialization of their proprietary AI, which aims to boost hashing power without requiring significant extra energy.",

In the same period QBT's share price has dropped 17% from 0.63p to 0.525p When bitcoin did a 6-bagger, QBT fell. When bitcoin halved in value, QBT fell. Thus there is no relationship between BTC and QBT prices. To me, this strongly suggests that the market knows that QBT is not related to BTC. Rather, the market knows that QBT is oprtating in another area. QBT's spikes have been on the back of hopeful RNSs, all of which failed to result in deals and revenue. So it seems to me that QBT's main 'product' is hope itself, which it sellsto the market by way of fundraises. And this hope is often hyped by Gardin during interviews. Just my take on things. Will happily be proved wrong by the announcement of a material commercial deal, or by the publishing of validation of QBT's Methods by an trusted independent company (such as one of the Big 4)  or reputable newspaper (such as The Financial Times or Computer Weekly).",

The arrogance and his patronising manner at the end of the interview was not good! The FACT is if you're a going to post videos at the beginning of 2024 stating revenue this year and then do it again a year later and still nothing, what do you think would happen? Another FACT is, there are no signed deals or progress reports with respected ASIC chip manufacturers. The NDAs route aren't going to increase the SP - the market isn't stupid. I don't understand what they need to protect? Surely knowing who they're talking to would help their cause with investors? I see this falling below 0.0050p very soon.

Gardin: Yeah, that's has to do with the three, ahh, umm, with three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, because there is substantial amount of source code and they start to release it to us, err, umm, partially, er, because, er, erm, we wouldn't have anyway the, the ability to deal with three, err, different operating system [sic], ahh, three different drivers, and so that's something that is going on incrementally, err, but, ahh, it's, it's part of, of an agreed, ahh, erm, path, er, that, er, we have, er, defined with this, er, three potential partners. Host: Mmm. I mean, ahh, investors are keen to understand progress with those partners. How would you describe the current stage of those relationships and why the phase is taking time? Gardin: Ahhh, well, I mean *laughs* the, say that, ahh, the main focus with the three manufacturers, but not the only but main work focus is Method C. Method C you need to train the neural network [sic] and train it on the specific ASICs that will be in the machine. So the training is very ASIC oriented, specific ASIC oriented, and that's not something you do overnight, and to get these machines there is legal paperwork because one thing is to sign an NDA, the other thing is to sign all the guarantees for the software, the proprietary software that they share, the design of this ASIC because we need to understand how they work internally, the specs of these ASICs which are not necessarily in the public domain, so, I mean, it's not as simple as I sign an NDA, I come and pick up a machine tomorrow. *laughs and shakes head* Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. Host: Francesco, hope you'll continue to keep us updated with your progress, thank you very much for your time today. Gardin: Thank you Host: Francesco Gardin, the CEO of Quantum Blockchain Technologies.",

The first few words spoken from time 00:00 to 00:18 are a repeat of what was stated in the full interview at time 05:06 to 05:24. My transcript covers the full complete interview from 0:20 onwards; it does not contain the repeated words. This transcript was generated solely by me by hand (and ears) without using any tools or sources other than a word processor and listening to the YouTube video. I have not used any transcript generated by YouTube or any other software, tool, or source. ------------------- [Part 1 of 2] Host: Hello, you're watching Proactive. I'm joined by Francesco Gardin, the CEO of Quantum Blockchain Technologies. Francesco, very good to speak with you. Your update todays follows a positive industry conference rather than a single breakthrough. What was the key takeaway for QBT from attending the Nashville event? Gardin: Ok, good morning, Stephen. Ahh, the Bitcoin Park in Nashville is one of the center [sic] ah, in the US of the bitcoin culture. And so, ah, attending this events is always very important because it's the best way to network with the real professionals in the sector. Err, so it's been, ahh, one-and-a-half days but extremely intensive with the many, many, many, many side meetings that we had with the main players, especially with three, ahh, manufacturers of ASIC [sic] for bitcoin mining that we, ah, have signed the NDA with, and we are progressing, ahh, work with them, which is extremely good, and it's also good to show your face there and to show your physical presence together with our US consultants. Ahh, the, errm, so this is part of the normal commercial relationship, err, business relationship that you have to entertain and also monitor any development in the industry. Apart from this, it was very important for us also because one of the major problem that we had to face in the past is that 99% of the market is dominated by the Chinese manufacturers, and their policy is that no specs on the ASICs, err, and no availability of access to the software which runs on their mining rigs. Therefore that fact that now, finally, other after this gigantic effort, ahh, there is this whole stack available which is open source from the design of the hashing boards, design of control boards, the software which controls it, the even a pool, now is all open source which means that we can, ah, ah, as well as working with the three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, ...

But today's RNS does not state anything about ASIC-specific training, so the interview does not override this (according to Mikeydj). Mikeydj wants Gardin's claims during interviews to be disregarded when those claims are not borne out. But Mikeydj wants Gardin's claims during interviews to be considered positive before they fail to materialise.",

There\u2019s a common pattern that appears across many AIM and small-cap boards and in particular this. RNS brings out droves. It usually starts with a strong negative or positive claim. Then follow-up posts repeat or reinforce it. Over time, repetition can make opinions feel like established facts, even when no new evidence has been added. You have seen this before right ? Another common tactic is presenting complex technical points in a way that suggests confusion or contradiction. Readers can mistake complexity for proof something is wrong. Examples of Common Posting Styles Seen Across Discussions: \u2022 Pedrobull \u2013 Often posts short, slogan-style negativity or repetition phrases that reinforce sentiment rather than introduce new information. \u2022 Phimx \u2013 Frequently posts longer technical or RNS-based interpretations, often highlighting perceived contradictions or uncertainty in company communications. \u2022 riceyboy84 \u2013 Commonly posts timeline predictions and worst-case scenario outcomes such as delisting or failure, usually framed as inevitability. \u2022 KoolKat15 \u2013 Often focuses on investor protection arguments, confidence issues, and the absence of revenue or deals, typically presented in detailed opinion posts. \u2022 allforprofit \u2013 Tends to use strong criticism of leadership capability or company direction, often framed as performance concern commentary. \u2022 0134 \u2013 Regularly raises concerns around funding, placings, or financial sustainability speculation. \u2022 Plutuq \u2013 Often posts probability or price prediction style commentary suggesting likely short-term trading outcomes. \u2022 Awl007 \u2013 Typically posts shorter reinforcement or agreement style comments that echo broader sentiment already expressed. \u2022 mrhanji \u2013 Usually posts bullish outlook commentary, often focusing on potential partnerships, future valuation upside, or encouraging holders to ignore negative sentiment. These observations relate to posting style patterns only and form part of normal forum debate dynamics seen across many shares and boards. But WHY so many self proclaimed uninvested users spreading negativity ? None of this means criticism or support is invalid. Healthy debate is important. It simply means investors should separate: \u2022 Evidence \u2022 Interpretation \u2022 Repetition \u2022 Emotion Always worth checking source material yourself rather than relying purely on forum consensus.",

Previously he has stated  \"However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved\" Fine, but in the interview he talks about training the Oracle and it has to be specifically the ASIC used in  the machines. QBT have to understand how the ASICs work internally. He goes onto say there is legal paperwork for the software and it's not as simple as signing a NDA and coming to pick up the machine tomorrow. It is confusing because we don't know if he's talking about the soft or hard Method C. We know fro. RNS 12 Nov 2025 \" the performance of this new software-only version is independent of the ASIC being used in the miner.\" So what on earth was this update about? PS: incidentally what was learned, after waffling in other RNS about the 10,000s of Chinese after market boards, which I believe was another one of his focal points for revenue, the Chinese were giving nothing away to enable any progress. No ASIC or software details. Obviously if the Chinese were actually approached, they had no interest in what Gardin had to offer.",

Unfortunately, for genuine shareholders this will never rise again IMO unless there is factual evidence of a deal/partnership/revenue.

The reason is simple, there are no deals/partnerships/revenue now or for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, this will end in tears for all LTH's. The bullish sentiment from certain posters is plain false in my opinion and everyone should call this company out because even though many understand the risks involved, they've been told false information and it's wrong! You can't get away from the nonsense that has been released in RNSs, videos and interviews. This behaviour should be reported and the authorities should act again this misinformation.",

These discussions were focused on the timing for the delivery of both hardware and software from these potential customers and commercial partners. It should be noted that partial access to source code has already been granted to the Company.\" The RNS says virtually nothing, it is bloated with filler words and phrases.  Discussions about delivering a few mining rigs and software. Doesn't Gardin know about DHL, UPS and FedEx. Why does fluff like this have to be in a RNS, it's routine for tens of thousands of companies each day. In the RNS 5 Dec 2025 Gardin said \" ... The process has reached the stage where these three companies will now be needing to make their mining rigs available to QBT's testing team at its laboratory in Milan, with access to their relevant source code...\" So here we are 2 months later and Gardin is supposedly still discussing delivery of miners and software from the NDA companies. An absolute joke, is that the developments since the beginning of December. Mrhanji and Mickdj You believe this is a serious R&D company, I doubt you do. No-one can be that foolish",

For example, if a clause in the NDA said something like \"this NDA shall remain in force fir seven (7) years from the date if signing\". An NDA could still be 'in place' yet not require any progress to occur. Hexam said \"... but the most bizarre thing in this weird RNS is that they say the conference gave the opportunity of 'allowing QBT\u2019s management team to engage with those ASIC manufacturers which have signed NDAs with the Company.'\" Very odd. It makes an image pop into my head of Gardin cornering an NDA signatory in the bar and repeatedly asking \"Have you sent us sime rigs yet, guv?\". But I agree with you - choosing to converse during conferences rather than via phone, video call. email, etc. strongly suggests they're just not that into QBT. Mind you, if the project only progresses after discussions every few months at bitcoin conferences, that could support the theory that this is a lifestyle company. Are those companies not answering QBT\u2019s call and emails? Why do they need a conference to engage with them?",

What\u2019s actually happening is simpler: QBT has been running an R&D programme with multiple approaches, descriptions have evolved as implementations are tested, progress has been slower than hoped (as is common in R&D), and outcomes ultimately depend on independent verification, not forum rhetoric. None of that proves success, but neither does repetition of negative narratives prove failure. The only things that will settle this are evidence, testing results, and disclosures. Until then, most of what\u2019s posted here is noise layered on top of opinion. Readers should separate certainty-sounding posts from verifiable facts, and decide accordingly.",

The RNS most definitely did not say that they *will* produce an ASIC. But in the 3 Dec 2021 public interview, their CEO Gardin *did* say that QBT's target was to produce an ASIC that was, at a minumum, twice as fast as the keading ASIC at the time, within one year. His guidance is not caveated; these are stated as definites. Gardin states \"The chip that *we will produce*...\". This is definite guidance with no caveats, if, buts, mights, or maybes. Gardin also states the chip \"...will be more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip...\". Again, this is definite performance guidance with no caveats. Gardin also states \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\". Here the CEO is giving guidance that their target is to produce the ASIC in a year. No caveats at all. There are two ways to look at this. The first is to accept that QBT completely failed to achieve their guidance target stated publically by their CEO. The second is to accept that anything their CEOs say in public interviews is unreliable, may not reflect reality, and should not be used to influence your investment decisions.",

          "content": "While the RNS very clearly does not state that QBT intends to actually make the 5nm ASIC, investors could be forgiven for believing that this was their intention. Investors would have got this impresdion from the public statements of CEO Gardin during the 3 Dec 2021 Proactive Investor interview (link at bottom). Here are some of Gardin's statements regarding the ASIC: At 03:05 Gardin says \"It was quite complex to be able to attract the attention of this large [5nm ASIC] manufacturer and actually being able to engage them and to book some production time at the beginning of Q1 2023\" At 04:14 Gardin says \"The chip that we will produce will be far more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip, but we are confident that it will be much, much faster when we introduce the results of the second patent\" and \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\" Then at 05:14 Gardin says \"We are getting extraordinary results from our AI team which means if we can incorporate those results into our chip, our chip could be 100 times, 1000 times faster.\" But as Mikeydj rightly posted, interviews are not guidance and can be disregarded. I would go further and will state the obvious: that after this debacle, all of Gardin's claims during interviews can be safely ignored as hopelessly fantastical delusions of grandeur which have never have and never will be borne out in the real world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyx67cydEMI",

Turns out Brewhaha contributed a lot of extremely well articulated criticisms of QBT and their Methods, made some astute observations, and raised some very relevant questions. So it seems that anyone who now criticises QBT is assumed to be Brewhaha. It is as if QBT's supporters cannot grasp that more than one person could possibly be critical of QBT *shrug*",

Again, in general they claim many discussions are taking place but rarely do these discussions reach a conclusion or the results informed to shareholders. Many placings and consolidation take place and employees are minimal. In short everything is vague and difficult to pin down. I very much doubt I have ever called this a scam,",

It certainly doesn't mean I was mistake in thinking very few people here understand Bitcoin mining. As for reframing disagreement as ignorance, I'm not convinced  you trying to link disagreement through discussion and engagement to my observation of  investors ignorance is valid.  There is no disagreement with 'technical' speculation or inference simply because ignorance prevents the ignorant from disagreeing.More likely disagreement occurs for subjects where there is little ignorance but causal from differing variations and expectations in inference of  vague and poorly determined and presented factual content.

Lol wtf bob mined bitcoin ...jeez he must know abit more i guess...what a joke \"Appointment of Strategic AdviserFormer Intel Blockscale Executive Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focused on an R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jose Rios as Strategic Adviser. Mr. Rios is the former General Manager of Blockchain and Business Solutions in the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel Corp, where he spent 25 years. He was instrumental in the Blockscale ASIC project - Intel's dedicated chip for Bitcoin mining - and he brings extensive expertise in ASIC chip design, production and proprietary architecture development to QBT. Mr. Rios has been privately consulting for the Company since the latter part of 2023, and has now agreed to accept the position of Strategic Adviser. He has already played a pivotal role in forging key relationships with some of the leading players in the global Bitcoin industry and he has also provided strategic guidance on the market positioning of QBT's technology. Mr. Rios has actively assisted QBT at major industry events including, Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, Bitcoin Disrupt 2024 in Miami and Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, with plans to attend Amsterdam Bitcoin 2024. His close involvement with the Company will ensure QBT's growing recognition at the forefront of industry events and developments. Francesco Gardin, CEO and Chairman of QBT, commented: \"QBT was a keen supporter of Intel's Blockscale project, from the end 2022 to the early months of 2023, when the ASIC chip production was discontinued. Around that time, we were introduced to Mr Rios, its project manager and, following a period of mutual understanding into what QBT was looking to create, Jose initially agreed to consult for the Company in a private capacity. This has resulted in extremely valuable insights for QBT with regards to the Bitcoin industry, the major players in the sector and the analysis of key trends. \"Today's announcement that Mr Rios has agreed to become Strategic Adviser is an important step for us and one which we value very highly knowing the contribution he will bring to the Company.\" About Jose Rios:Mr. Rios, aged 51, is a seasoned technology executive with over two decades of experience in sales, engineering and product development within the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley. Jose has a strong background in custom silicon design, having overseen multiple high-performance computing projects across AI, automotive and blockchain sectors. His expertise spans from initial concept through to production, with a focus on optimising solutions for complex, data-intensive workloads.

Plenty of other examples are available. The point is that none of us are truly experts and the only way we will know for certain who is right when QBT provide the tangible evidence (or not) of what they say i.e. independent verification that their product/prototype works with the description of how. Until then it\u2019s all just opinion and hot air. We should find out soon though one way or the other as surely the waiting can\u2019t be strung out too much longer?",

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin?

But whatever is the case I wouldn\u2019t hold up Gardin as some kind of guru as he has come up with some stunningly daft things in the past like when suggesting that if you mine a bitcoin in say three minutes you can then save energy by switching off for seven minutes until the next one can be mined! Plenty of other examples are available. The point is that none of us are truly experts and the only way we will know for certain who is right when QBT provide the tangible evidence (or not) of what they say i.e. independent verification that their product/prototype works with the description of how. Until then it\u2019s all just opinion and hot air. We should find out soon though one way or the other as surely the waiting can\u2019t be strung out too much longer?",

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin?

What you are describing is your reconstruction of how Method C must have evolved, based on your current understanding of mining architecture. That is not the same thing as demonstrating a contradiction in disclosed statements. Two points matter here: Change of implementation detail is not a contradiction of claim The core claim has remained that an AI-driven oracle can influence which work is prioritised or discarded before full hashing. Whether that logic sits on an ASIC, FPGA, control board, or software layer  is an implementation choice, not a reversal of principle. R&D projects routinely move functionality across layers as constraints are better understood. You are explicitly speculating about motives and competence Phrases like \u201cI speculate that Gardin finally realised\u2026\u201d and \u201cignorance rather than development\u201d are interpretations, not facts. You may believe them to be likely, but they are not supported by any evidence stating \u201cthis approach was abandoned because we misunderstood mining\u201d. Your three-stage description of mining is broadly accepted,  but it doesn\u2019t prove that earlier descriptions were false, only that you believe they were inefficient or unnecessary. Inefficiency is not  impossibility, and refinement not  cover-up. So we\u2019re back at the same distinction: You are arguing that evolving technical descriptions imply incompetence. I am saying that, absent of a disclosed contradiction, that conclusion is not established fact, yet you claim it fact in an authoritative manner, without context of how and why  we are expected to give you credit, or even benefit of doubt.  Why would i buy double glazing of a person off a person who cannot quantify their technical knowledge and authoritative views  of the products. Readers can decide which interpretation they find more persuasive , but it\u2019s important to be clear about where disclosure ends and inference begins.",

I don't think that is in dispute, go read several RNS and listen to interviews. My observation is, that was incorrect. Why was that? Because Gardin didn't understand the hashing/mining process. This at odds with his admissions of having a team of around 20 experts working for him. As I have explained creating headers to be hashed by a 1 TH/s miner should be possible but the time to evaluate each new header is unknown. Note by headers I mean modification of the header template provided by the pool by changing the Merkle root (as the extra-NONCE) but before it is sent to the ASIC I speculate that Gardin finally realised how hashing was being performed by the ASIC and realised that an Oracle on an ASIC was not necessary. To be clear hashing of the header can be divided into 3 basic stages 1.  Assemble the header from the information supplied by the pool, there is only one supplied. Performed by.  the control system 2. Send to ASIC and hash with  4.3 billion different NONCEs. If no result 3. Change Merkle root to create new variation of the original header, again performed by control system and repeat. My conclusion from the above: The story has changed it changed because of ignorance rather than development but you can spin it as development if you wish. But without doubt you have to ask the question, where was the expertise when this ASIC/FPGA scheme was being developed when any amateur miner could have probably told Gardin how mining worked. It also complements the fiasco with the CGMiner software.",

I'll just paste my conclusion here Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !\" You a tually consider this a 'technical conclusion' ? I'm assuming you think its technical because of the text 4.3 Billion NONCES - 1 TH/s hasher - 8.3 Ms and microprocessor Bizzare. Truly Bizarre please Google these terms to aid your understanding",

You are saying the template is evaluated as a job lot but still it is  instances are being discarded  I.e. identical to the hardware method. Common sense tells us we would expect both forms of Method C to operate similarly. The difference is Gardin said initially that an ASIC was needed because the Oracle had to match the ASIC throughput.  This was incorrect, it is feasible that a microprocessor can hash a new Merkle root and evaluate the resulting altered template during the time the current Merkle root template is being hashed 4.3 billion times. So Gardin and his team of so called experts didn't understand the process",

A few key points for readers: Header vs instance is being deliberately collapsed The post repeatedly asserts that a \u201cheader\u201d and an \u201cinstance of a header\u201d are the same thing. They are not used interchangeably in QBT\u2019s disclosures. Instances refer to nonce-variant hash attempts. Header assessment refers to evaluating block templates / header states before committing full ASIC hash cycles. Re-labelling them as identical is the author\u2019s interpretation, not a fact established by QBT or the RNS. Throughput arguments miss the architectural claim The argument assumes the Oracle must compete with ASIC throughput on a like-for-like basis. That is not what Method C claims. The claim is probabilistic pre-selection, not brute-force substitution. Saying \u201cASICs are faster\u201d is irrelevant if the process being described is filtering, not hashing. \u201cHe changed the story\u201d is assertion, not evidence What\u2019s actually happened is an evolution from hardware to software description as different implementations are explored. That is explicitly disclosed. No evidence is provided that anything has been \u201ccovered up\u201d ,only that the author now disagrees with the interpretation. Speculation is being presented as forensic conclusion Phrases like \u201cwe deduce\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d, and \u201cGardin didn\u2019t understand\u201d are opinion, not fact \u2014 yet they are framed as definitive findings. In short, this post does not introduce new information. It repackages a negative conclusion using technical language, relies on disputed definitions, and then treats those disputes as proof of failure.

          "content": "Method C software running on the operating system of the miner performs real time assessment of different headers, we are told by the web site.  The first puzzle is what does Gardin mean by different headers. The header template provided by the pool forms the core of the header to be hashed. Most fields are immutable but 2 fields are very important and mutable, the Merkle root and the 32-bit NONCE field. To form different headers these fields are changed to produce trillions of slightly different headers.  The NONCE field has one job, to cycle or increment from 0 to 4.3 billion. For a 1 TH/s miner this takes 8.6 ms, a mere blink of an eye. Every time a single bit changes in the Merkle root the NONCE cycles through 4.3 billion values for that variation of the header. Of course for multi chip ASIC rigs  the time drops equivalently, the latest mining rigs  can achieve 1,000 TH/s so will cycle the NONCE in 8.6 microseconds. What happens to the header after assessment by the Oracle is complete?  We know the answer to that \u201c this approach avoids processing a large number of headers which have little, or no probability to generate a hash above the pool target\u201d In other words that header is discarded and is not hashed, as we have been led to believe from previous descriptions of Method C.  How is this different from the brute force approach using \u201cinstances of Headers\u201d ? Again from the web site description \u201c Unlike current standard BTC mining approach, based on a search, where the mining rig runs as many Tera hashes per second as possible, during the circa\u201d 10 minutes allowance for each block, with no special criteria on which instances of the header to process first, also described as brute force\u201d We deduce that an instance of a header is simply a specific header, what at one time was called an input to SHA256. Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !",

It seems that QBT are now doing something very different from thier prospectus. \"Reasons for listing: The purpose of the Placing is to raise funds to invest in and develop further innovative concepts which the Directors believe can become successful commercial enterprises. Funds are also required to continue to raise the level of in-house expertise and to look at initiatives to build the Brainspark brand outside the UK, particularly in continental Europe.\" Hmm. That does not seem to have gine very well. Maybe tbey need another 25 years? \"Dividends: The Company is seeking primarily to achieve capital growth for its shareholders. It is not the present intention of the Directors to pay a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.\" Have shareholders been rewarded with capital growth? When listed, the shares were 125p. Today they are 0.575p. That's a 99.54% loss. Hmm. https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/images/Brainspark_prospectus1.pdf",

Under the accrual accounting method\u2014the standard for most mid-to-large businesses and public companies\u2014revenue is recognized when it is earned, which occurs at the moment of delivery, regardless of when the customer actually pays. Revenue Recognition Principles The relationship between delivery and revenue is governed by the Revenue Recognition Principle (standardized internationally as IFRS 15 and in the U.S. as ASC 606). These standards state that revenue is recognized when a company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer. Product Delivery: Revenue is typically recognized at a single point in time when physical possession or legal title transfers to the buyer. Service Delivery: Revenue is often recognized over time as the service is performed. For example, a monthly subscription service generates revenue incrementally each day the service is available to the user\"",

I'm curious to know why anyone still believes that QBT's business model will lead to anything commercially viable? Am I wrong in saying that the company has released a series of varying narratives over the years, but no evidence of any real substantive progress? You've had Method's A, B, C, SAAS, ASIC development and Quantum, with commercialisation usually touted to arrive in the following year, but then it all goes quiet before a new narrative comes out. I'm not saying QBT aren't trying to achieve their commercial goals, but are those goals viable on their budget? How many registered employee's does the company have? Are the researchers and developers just working on the projects in their spare time, more like hobbyists who might reap future reward? My view is that the miners who spend Billions building datacenters and filling them with rigs, likely have far larger budgets to develop their own proprietary software and systems to enhance their mining operations, and protect the secrecy of their systems to maintain advantage over competitors. Something else to consider is that with each halving mining profits reduce and Datacenters are likely to move operations away from mining and into AI. I've always believed that Bitcoin is built on false narratives and will eventually fail for whatever reason. Maybe power hungry AI will displace Crypto mining as the next big thing, since AI appears to be the next big thing to bubble up; I can see how AI is useful, whereas I view Bitcoin as useless. Will AI finally kill Bitcoin? Maybe. AI is as power hungry as BTC mining, the Datacenters will likely choose one over another dependent on ROI, I believe AI will win over BTC mining.",

In the context of this specific business activity (namely the ASIC manufacturer engaging in performance testing of QBT's product which QBT intends to sell to them) the ASIC manufacturer is a primary party; not a third party. The Osbourne Clarke website gives an example kegal case in which involved a difference of opinion over the meaning \"third party\".

The second parties I.e. the 3 ASIC manufacturers subject to a NDA and who have also built their own mining rigs. The same rigs that QBT is supposedly installing their software on. It is assumed each arrangement has a seperate set of terms. It isn't semantics, there are only first and multiple second parties involved here.

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

Here is the status of QBT's production timeline: Software Commercialization Phase: QBT is currently transitioning from R&D to commercial application, having entered into three Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with ASIC manufacturers to test its Method C AI Oracle on their mining rigs at its Milan laboratory. Live Testing (2026): As of Feb 2026, QBT reported progress on integrating its software with third-party hardware following meetings at the Nashville Energy & Mining Summit. Shift to Software Focus: QBT deprioritized a hardware-based chip in favor of a software-based approach (SaaS), which allows for a faster rollout, with commercialization expected \"later this year\". Operational Focus: The company is currently engaged in \"fine-tuning\" its algorithms, with CEO Francesco Gardin indicating that the company is on the verge of turning its technology into commercial products. While no specific \"launch date\" for mass production was given in the Feb 2026, the company is in the final phases of testing and transitioning toward active commercial deployment in the 2025-2026 cycle",

Everyone does it. But switching from extreme bullish conviction to extreme failure certainty while presenting both as \u201cfact\u201d raises serious credibility questions. Investors should ask themselves: \u2022 Was the original bullish certainty wrong? \u2022 Is the current bearish certainty evidence-based or emotionally driven? \u2022 Why is the same certainty language being used in opposite directions? \u2022 Is the goal discussion \u2014 or sentiment influence? This matters because newer investors often assume long-term posters are consistent, reliable or evidence-driven. Posting history here shows conviction has flipped 180\u00b0 while the communication style has stayed the same \u2014 strong certainty, emotive language, and persuasion framing. That is not balanced analysis. That is narrative positioning. Readers should be extremely cautious when any poster: \u2022 Presents opinion as fact \u2022 Uses absolute outcome language repeatedly \u2022 Shifts stance dramatically while maintaining certainty tone \u2022 Focuses on emotional reaction rather than verifiable data The safest investment decisions are always based on: \u2022 Official RNS disclosures \u2022 Verifiable technical or commercial milestones \u2022 Independent research \u2022 Not forum personalities or conviction strength Always review full posting history \u2014 not just current sentiment.",

But pretending recurring posting waves are just random discussion is increasingly hard to accept when the same usernames appear, using the same themes, at the same trigger points. Let\u2019s be blunt. Every RNS or interview release is followed by a near-identical sequence: \u2022 Immediate worst-case certainty posts (failure, insolvency, delisting, fraud suggestions) \u2022 Follow-up reinforcement posts comparing QBT to historic AIM failures \u2022 Long retrospective posts selectively quoting historic RNS lines to construct failure narratives \u2022 Additional posts reframing progress delays as proof of incompetence or deception \u2022 Short one-liners reinforcing \u201cconsensus negativity\u201d This is not new. It is predictable,repeated and reported. Calling the company a \u201cskeleton non commercial project\u201d is not fact \u2014 it is opinion. Stating opinion as inevitability repeatedly is narrative building, not analysis. Claiming AIM losses justify assuming failure here is also flawed logic. Risk exists across AIM. It is not evidence of outcome for any specific company. No issue with scepticism. The issue is when scepticism is presented as certainty and repeated until newer investors assume it is established truth. Readers should ask themselves: \u2022 Are new facts being introduced? \u2022 Or are historic statements being recycled to reinforce sentiment? \u2022 Are timelines being debated fairly or selectively? \u2022 Are posters invested or repeatedly focused on discouraging investment? Debate is healthy. Narrative campaigning is something different.",

Of course if you go to most other boards you will see the same words and phrases used. Not surprising really is it, everyone is using  the same language about the same subjects. The same characters exist and post with the same rang of skills and experience. There's the moronic one-liners \" this is going to explode on news\" etc. The poster that can't help but post disguised swear words, the insulted. Absolute fanatical believers and disbelievers. The 'expert' on the company and the opposite poster that knows nothing. So it goes on, pick a board and read it! Me, I'm not much for great conspiracies but AIM has been shown to be very misleading and created huge losses for private investors.  Therefore, I suspect there are people paid to push agendas here maybe and elsewhere but why pay when the British public do it for you and for free? Personally I post here without help or hindrance from anyone else. What I write are my own words using my own ideas. Very occasionally I cite AI text but like others, at least honest posters, I note the use of AI assisted posts. I think QBT is a skeleton non commercial project, fleshed out by vague and ambiguous RNS and open to huge interpretation of their meaning and importance. So ends my sermon!",

This is simply an observation of how certain discussions repeatedly develop on this board, particularly after RNS or interview releases. Readers may wish to watch how some usernames tend to interact and how narratives build in stages. riceyboy84 Often introduces strong certainty or worst-case outcome posts such as \u201cend game\u201d, insolvency, delisting or investigation themes. These posts frequently appear early and set a negative sentiment anchor. wyt3fr0g and occasionally Pedrobull Often follow with short reinforcement comments or comparisons to failed AIM companies. These tend to increase perceived consensus rather than introduce new information. Phimx Frequently then builds longer posts quoting RNS history, highlighting contradictions or delays, and directly challenges bullish posters. This often provides technical justification to earlier sentiment posts. Hexam Often reinforces technical or commercial plausibility concerns using conditional logic (for example questioning whether testing has worked or whether partners are engaged). This tends to add credibility to earlier sceptical arguments. UserSteve Regularly expands discussions into historical company performance, long-term revenue absence, and share price decline over many years. This often reframes current debate into a broader historic failure narrative. Plutuq Often reinforces investor frustration or timeline disappointment themes, particularly around delivery expectations versus results. Again, none of the above means any poster is correct or incorrect. It simply shows how forum sentiment can build through layered interaction between the same regular contributors. Readers may find it useful to separate: \u2022 Evidence in official disclosures \u2022 Interpretation of that evidence \u2022 Repetition of narratives \u2022 Emotional certainty language . Explore these users posting history (it reveals a lot) Always worth forming your own view based on primary company information rather than thread momentum. Just sharing as an observation for awareness, particularly for newer investors who may not have seen how these discussion cycles tend to repeat.",

It is no secret that there is no RNS in the company's 26-year history that announces a commercial product, or any significant and sustained revenue.

The companies become simply pump and dumps. Gamblers trying to make a quick fast buck. Long term holders diluted then consolidated until their holding is worthless and not worth selling. This looks like a great target for the P&D now. I think most genuine investors now realise thoughts of great wealth are not realistic.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction. IP Strategy: QBT is focusing on patenting its core AI Oracle technology, though some developments are kept as trade secrets. The company describes this period as a \"very, very intense and busy\" time as they move towards full commercialization of their proprietary AI, which aims to boost hashing power without requiring significant extra energy.",

Do a Google sesrch for Share Price QBT and select Max. You will see the chart shows the share price has fallen from 30,500p (in April 2000) to 0.53p today. mrhanji said \"What we should be focused on is the rns and the developments over the past couple of years..\" Better still, we should look at all the RNSs. It is no secret that there is no RNS in the company's 26-year history that announces a commercial product, or any significant and sustained revenue. Every commercial project appears to have failed, and the company constantly changes to another project. It seems perfectly obvious to me that this explains the monumental erosion of value.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction. IP Strategy: QBT is focusing on patenting its core AI Oracle technology, though some developments are kept as trade secrets. The company describes this period as a \"very, very intense and busy\" time as they move towards full commercialization of their proprietary AI, which aims to boost hashing power without requiring significant extra energy.",

In the same period QBT's share price has dropped 17% from 0.63p to 0.525p When bitcoin did a 6-bagger, QBT fell. When bitcoin halved in value, QBT fell. Thus there is no relationship between BTC and QBT prices. To me, this strongly suggests that the market knows that QBT is not related to BTC. Rather, the market knows that QBT is oprtating in another area. QBT's spikes have been on the back of hopeful RNSs, all of which failed to result in deals and revenue. So it seems to me that QBT's main 'product' is hope itself, which it sellsto the market by way of fundraises. And this hope is often hyped by Gardin during interviews. Just my take on things. Will happily be proved wrong by the announcement of a material commercial deal, or by the publishing of validation of QBT's Methods by an trusted independent company (such as one of the Big 4)  or reputable newspaper (such as The Financial Times or Computer Weekly).",

The arrogance and his patronising manner at the end of the interview was not good! The FACT is if you're a going to post videos at the beginning of 2024 stating revenue this year and then do it again a year later and still nothing, what do you think would happen? Another FACT is, there are no signed deals or progress reports with respected ASIC chip manufacturers. The NDAs route aren't going to increase the SP - the market isn't stupid. I don't understand what they need to protect? Surely knowing who they're talking to would help their cause with investors? I see this falling below 0.0050p very soon.

So this is creating a new, entirely new situation in the sector. Finally you have chips available in quantities, and you have already have the entire design of a system, of, of, a, a, an ecosystem for mining, and this is for us is a game-changer because we expect, or the industry expect, that there will be many manufacturers who will assemble systems, starting from this open source designs, and therefore there will be more companies offering their systems, which will bring a very healthy change in this market dominated by 99% by the three manufacturers in China. Host: Francesco, there's been confusion around partial access to source code. Can you explain in simple terms what access QBT has today, and what it doesn't yet have? Gardin: Yeah, that's has to do with the three, ahh, umm, with three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, because there is substantial amount of source code and they start to release it to us, err, umm, partially, er, because, er, erm, we wouldn't have anyway the, the ability to deal with three, err, different operating system [sic], ahh, three different drivers, and so that's something that is going on incrementally, err, but, ahh, it's, it's part of, of an agreed, ahh, erm, path, er, that, er, we have, er, defined with this, er, three potential partners. Host: Mmm. I mean, ahh, investors are keen to understand progress with those partners. How would you describe the current stage of those relationships and why the phase is taking time? Gardin: Ahhh, well, I mean *laughs* the, say that, ahh, the main focus with the three manufacturers, but not the only but main work focus is Method C. Method C you need to train the neural network [sic] and train it on the specific ASICs that will be in the machine. So the training is very ASIC oriented, specific ASIC oriented, and that's not something you do overnight, and to get these machines there is legal paperwork because one thing is to sign an NDA, the other thing is to sign all the guarantees for the software, the proprietary software that they share, the design of this ASIC because we need to understand how they work internally, the specs of these ASICs which are not necessarily in the public domain, so, I mean, it's not as simple as I sign an NDA, I come and pick up a machine tomorrow. *laughs and shakes head* Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. Host: Francesco, hope you'll continue to keep us updated with your progress, thank you very much for your time today.

I'm joined by Francesco Gardin, the CEO of Quantum Blockchain Technologies. Francesco, very good to speak with you. Your update todays follows a positive industry conference rather than a single breakthrough. What was the key takeaway for QBT from attending the Nashville event? Gardin: Ok, good morning, Stephen. Ahh, the Bitcoin Park in Nashville is one of the center [sic] ah, in the US of the bitcoin culture. And so, ah, attending this events is always very important because it's the best way to network with the real professionals in the sector. Err, so it's been, ahh, one-and-a-half days but extremely intensive with the many, many, many, many side meetings that we had with the main players, especially with three, ahh, manufacturers of ASIC [sic] for bitcoin mining that we, ah, have signed the NDA with, and we are progressing, ahh, work with them, which is extremely good, and it's also good to show your face there and to show your physical presence together with our US consultants. Ahh, the, errm, so this is part of the normal commercial relationship, err, business relationship that you have to entertain and also monitor any development in the industry. Apart from this, it was very important for us also because one of the major problem that we had to face in the past is that 99% of the market is dominated by the Chinese manufacturers, and their policy is that no specs on the ASICs, err, and no availability of access to the software which runs on their mining rigs. Therefore that fact that now, finally, other after this gigantic effort, ahh, there is this whole stack available which is open source from the design of the hashing boards, design of control boards, the software which controls it, the even a pool, now is all open source which means that we can, ah, ah, as well as working with the three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, ...

But today's RNS does not state anything about ASIC-specific training, so the interview does not override this (according to Mikeydj). Mikeydj wants Gardin's claims during interviews to be disregarded when those claims are not borne out. But Mikeydj wants Gardin's claims during interviews to be considered positive before they fail to materialise.",

The RNS does not announce immediate revenue or contract milestones but may indicate that development and partnership processes remain ongoing rather than stalled.

Thus there are apparent inconsistencies between the RNSs and the public statements from the CEO.

          "content": "How Narratives Sometimes Form Worth remembering that forum sentiment doesn\u2019t always build randomly. There\u2019s a common pattern that appears across many AIM and small-cap boards and in particular this. RNS brings out droves. It usually starts with a strong negative or positive claim. Then follow-up posts repeat or reinforce it. Over time, repetition can make opinions feel like established facts, even when no new evidence has been added. You have seen this before right ? Another common tactic is presenting complex technical points in a way that suggests confusion or contradiction. Readers can mistake complexity for proof something is wrong. Examples of Common Posting Styles Seen Across Discussions: \u2022 Pedrobull \u2013 Often posts short, slogan-style negativity or repetition phrases that reinforce sentiment rather than introduce new information. \u2022 Phimx \u2013 Frequently posts longer technical or RNS-based interpretations, often highlighting perceived contradictions or uncertainty in company communications. \u2022 riceyboy84 \u2013 Commonly posts timeline predictions and worst-case scenario outcomes such as delisting or failure, usually framed as inevitability. \u2022 KoolKat15 \u2013 Often focuses on investor protection arguments, confidence issues, and the absence of revenue or deals, typically presented in detailed opinion posts. \u2022 allforprofit \u2013 Tends to use strong criticism of leadership capability or company direction, often framed as performance concern commentary. \u2022 0134 \u2013 Regularly raises concerns around funding, placings, or financial sustainability speculation. \u2022 Plutuq \u2013 Often posts probability or price prediction style commentary suggesting likely short-term trading outcomes. \u2022 Awl007 \u2013 Typically posts shorter reinforcement or agreement style comments that echo broader sentiment already expressed. \u2022 mrhanji \u2013 Usually posts bullish outlook commentary, often focusing on potential partnerships, future valuation upside, or encouraging holders to ignore negative sentiment. These observations relate to posting style patterns only and form part of normal forum debate dynamics seen across many shares and boards. But WHY so many self proclaimed uninvested users spreading negativity ? None of this means criticism or support is invalid. Healthy debate is important. It simply means investors should separate: \u2022 Evidence \u2022 Interpretation \u2022 Repetition \u2022 Emotion Always worth checking source material yourself rather than relying purely on forum consensus.",

Previously he has stated  \"However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved\" Fine, but in the interview he talks about training the Oracle and it has to be specifically the ASIC used in  the machines. QBT have to understand how the ASICs work internally. He goes onto say there is legal paperwork for the software and it's not as simple as signing a NDA and coming to pick up the machine tomorrow. It is confusing because we don't know if he's talking about the soft or hard Method C. We know fro. RNS 12 Nov 2025 \" the performance of this new software-only version is independent of the ASIC being used in the miner.\" So what on earth was this update about? PS: incidentally what was learned, after waffling in other RNS about the 10,000s of Chinese after market boards, which I believe was another one of his focal points for revenue, the Chinese were giving nothing away to enable any progress. No ASIC or software details. Obviously if the Chinese were actually approached, they had no interest in what Gardin had to offer.",

The reason is simple, there are no deals/partnerships/revenue now or for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, this will end in tears for all LTH's. The bullish sentiment from certain posters is plain false in my opinion and everyone should call this company out because even though many understand the risks involved, they've been told false information and it's wrong!

It should be noted that partial access to source code has already been granted to the Company.\" The RNS says virtually nothing, it is bloated with filler words and phrases.  Discussions about delivering a few mining rigs and software. Doesn't Gardin know about DHL, UPS and FedEx. Why does fluff like this have to be in a RNS, it's routine for tens of thousands of companies each day. In the RNS 5 Dec 2025 Gardin said \" ... The process has reached the stage where these three companies will now be needing to make their mining rigs available to QBT's testing team at its laboratory in Milan, with access to their relevant source code...\" So here we are 2 months later and Gardin is supposedly still discussing delivery of miners and software from the NDA companies.

Hexam said \"... but the most bizarre thing in this weird RNS is that they say the conference gave the opportunity of 'allowing QBT\u2019s management team to engage with those ASIC manufacturers which have signed NDAs with the Company.'\" Very odd. It makes an image pop into my head of Gardin cornering an NDA signatory in the bar and repeatedly asking \"Have you sent us sime rigs yet, guv?\". But I agree with you - choosing to converse during conferences rather than via phone, video call. email, etc. strongly suggests they're just not that into QBT. Mind you, if the project only progresses after discussions every few months at bitcoin conferences, that could support the theory that this is a lifestyle company.

What\u2019s actually happening is simpler: QBT has been running an R&D programme with multiple approaches, descriptions have evolved as implementations are tested, progress has been slower than hoped (as is common in R&D), and outcomes ultimately depend on independent verification, not forum rhetoric. None of that proves success, but neither does repetition of negative narratives prove failure. The only things that will settle this are evidence, testing results, and disclosures.

The RNS most definitely did not say that they *will* produce an ASIC. But in the 3 Dec 2021 public interview, their CEO Gardin *did* say that QBT's target was to produce an ASIC that was, at a minumum, twice as fast as the keading ASIC at the time, within one year. His guidance is not caveated; these are stated as definites. Gardin states \"The chip that *we will produce*...\". This is definite guidance with no caveats, if, buts, mights, or maybes. Gardin also states the chip \"...will be more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip...\". Again, this is definite performance guidance with no caveats. Gardin also states \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\". Here the CEO is giving guidance that their target is to produce the ASIC in a year. No caveats at all. There are two ways to look at this. The first is to accept that QBT completely failed to achieve their guidance target stated publically by their CEO. The second is to accept that anything their CEOs say in public interviews is unreliable, may not reflect reality, and should not be used to influence your investment decisions.",

Investors would have got this impresdion from the public statements of CEO Gardin during the 3 Dec 2021 Proactive Investor interview (link at bottom). Here are some of Gardin's statements regarding the ASIC: At 03:05 Gardin says \"It was quite complex to be able to attract the attention of this large [5nm ASIC] manufacturer and actually being able to engage them and to book some production time at the beginning of Q1 2023\" At 04:14 Gardin says \"The chip that we will produce will be far more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip, but we are confident that it will be much, much faster when we introduce the results of the second patent\" and \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\" Then at 05:14 Gardin says \"We are getting extraordinary results from our AI team which means if we can incorporate those results into our chip, our chip could be 100 times, 1000 times faster.\" But as Mikeydj rightly posted, interviews are not guidance and can be disregarded. I would go further and will state the obvious: that after this debacle, all of Gardin's claims during interviews can be safely ignored as hopelessly fantastical delusions of grandeur which have never have and never will be borne out in the real world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyx67cydEMI",

Turns out Brewhaha contributed a lot of extremely well articulated criticisms of QBT and their Methods, made some astute observations, and raised some very relevant questions. So it seems that anyone who now criticises QBT is assumed to be Brewhaha. It is as if QBT's supporters cannot grasp that more than one person could possibly be critical of QBT *shrug*",

Usually it is difficult to determine exactly what technology they actually have and under what conditions or limits their claims are valid e.g. what references they use for measurement. Again, in general they claim many discussions are taking place but rarely do these discussions reach a conclusion or the results informed to shareholders. Many placings and consolidation take place and employees are minimal. In short everything is vague and difficult to pin down. I very much doubt I have ever called this a scam,",

It certainly doesn't mean I was mistake in thinking very few people here understand Bitcoin mining. As for reframing disagreement as ignorance, I'm not convinced  you trying to link disagreement through discussion and engagement to my observation of  investors ignorance is valid.  There is no disagreement with 'technical' speculation or inference simply because ignorance prevents the ignorant from disagreeing.More likely disagreement occurs for subjects where there is little ignorance but causal from differing variations and expectations in inference of  vague and poorly determined and presented factual content.

Lol wtf bob mined bitcoin ...jeez he must know abit more i guess...what a joke \"Appointment of Strategic AdviserFormer Intel Blockscale Executive Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focused on an R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jose Rios as Strategic Adviser. Mr. Rios is the former General Manager of Blockchain and Business Solutions in the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel Corp, where he spent 25 years. He was instrumental in the Blockscale ASIC project - Intel's dedicated chip for Bitcoin mining - and he brings extensive expertise in ASIC chip design, production and proprietary architecture development to QBT. Mr. Rios has been privately consulting for the Company since the latter part of 2023, and has now agreed to accept the position of Strategic Adviser. He has already played a pivotal role in forging key relationships with some of the leading players in the global Bitcoin industry and he has also provided strategic guidance on the market positioning of QBT's technology. Mr. Rios has actively assisted QBT at major industry events including, Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, Bitcoin Disrupt 2024 in Miami and Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, with plans to attend Amsterdam Bitcoin 2024. His close involvement with the Company will ensure QBT's growing recognition at the forefront of industry events and developments. Francesco Gardin, CEO and Chairman of QBT, commented: \"QBT was a keen supporter of Intel's Blockscale project, from the end 2022 to the early months of 2023, when the ASIC chip production was discontinued. Around that time, we were introduced to Mr Rios, its project manager and, following a period of mutual understanding into what QBT was looking to create, Jose initially agreed to consult for the Company in a private capacity. This has resulted in extremely valuable insights for QBT with regards to the Bitcoin industry, the major players in the sector and the analysis of key trends. \"Today's announcement that Mr Rios has agreed to become Strategic Adviser is an important step for us and one which we value very highly knowing the contribution he will bring to the Company.\" About Jose Rios:Mr. Rios, aged 51, is a seasoned technology executive with over two decades of experience in sales, engineering and product development within the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley. Jose has a strong background in custom silicon design, having overseen multiple high-performance computing projects across AI, automotive and blockchain sectors. His expertise spans from initial concept through to production, with a focus on optimising solutions for complex, data-intensive workloads.

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin? Your attacks on my posts revolve around, wordplay and semantics, literal meanings. definitions and phraseology. as if we are presenting evidence in a court of law.

Micky, firstly Google \"Source: Arm Inc 2023 IPO Prospectus (IBS, July 2022)\" this document by ARM, and they know a bit about ASIC design, shows approximate costs of ASIC manufacture. For a 5 nm ASIC they estimate $449 Million. Yes that's correct $449 Million.  Now it defies believe that a sane man contemplating production of a 5 nm ASIC would not jump on his laptop and do a bit of Googling to establish what he's dealing with ! Or, if he is employing ASIC/FPGA experts, casually ask them at tea break \" what would it take to make a 5nm ASIC chaps\" I think Gardin, in a RNS. stated something like he had reserved manufacturing time with an ASIC firm. Therefore any sane and sensible person would, I think, be astonished that Gardin did not know the cost. Apparently from subsequent RNS he persisted with the idea, even to this day. But the cost realisation eventually filtered through to him and he abandoned that particular fantasy. Maybe I am wrong perhaps his team did say, \"hey man that's an awesome cost\" but he carried on making announcements of building the fastest industry leading ASIC without any solid foundation for doing so. No public attempts were made to raise money it seems. So, I believe there were no 20 or so 'experts' because he continued to make RNS statements apparently oblivious to the cost and complexity of the project. He was also not being advised that hashing and Method C hardware did not actually require an Oracle on an ASIC. Additionally he was oblivious to the fact that throwing away 30% of your header inputs actually provides a 43% hashing rate increase, as shown by statements in several RNS. The alternative is, there is a team of world class experts but Gardin chose to ignore their advice and continued to make claims he had very little chance of achieving. My qualification, I can read.",

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin?

What you are describing is your reconstruction of how Method C must have evolved, based on your current understanding of mining architecture. That is not the same thing as demonstrating a contradiction in disclosed statements. Two points matter here: Change of implementation detail is not a contradiction of claim The core claim has remained that an AI-driven oracle can influence which work is prioritised or discarded before full hashing. Whether that logic sits on an ASIC, FPGA, control board, or software layer  is an implementation choice, not a reversal of principle. R&D projects routinely move functionality across layers as constraints are better understood. You are explicitly speculating about motives and competence Phrases like \u201cI speculate that Gardin finally realised\u2026\u201d and \u201cignorance rather than development\u201d are interpretations, not facts. You may believe them to be likely, but they are not supported by any evidence stating \u201cthis approach was abandoned because we misunderstood mining\u201d. Your three-stage description of mining is broadly accepted,  but it doesn\u2019t prove that earlier descriptions were false, only that you believe they were inefficient or unnecessary. Inefficiency is not  impossibility, and refinement not  cover-up. So we\u2019re back at the same distinction: You are arguing that evolving technical descriptions imply incompetence. I am saying that, absent of a disclosed contradiction, that conclusion is not established fact, yet you claim it fact in an authoritative manner, without context of how and why  we are expected to give you credit, or even benefit of doubt.  Why would i buy double glazing of a person off a person who cannot quantify their technical knowledge and authoritative views  of the products.

I don't think that is in dispute, go read several RNS and listen to interviews. My observation is, that was incorrect. Why was that? Because Gardin didn't understand the hashing/mining process. This at odds with his admissions of having a team of around 20 experts working for him. As I have explained creating headers to be hashed by a 1 TH/s miner should be possible but the time to evaluate each new header is unknown. Note by headers I mean modification of the header template provided by the pool by changing the Merkle root (as the extra-NONCE) but before it is sent to the ASIC I speculate that Gardin finally realised how hashing was being performed by the ASIC and realised that an Oracle on an ASIC was not necessary. To be clear hashing of the header can be divided into 3 basic stages 1.  Assemble the header from the information supplied by the pool, there is only one supplied. Performed by.  the control system 2. Send to ASIC and hash with  4.3 billion different NONCEs. If no result 3. Change Merkle root to create new variation of the original header, again performed by control system and repeat. My conclusion from the above: The story has changed it changed because of ignorance rather than development but you can spin it as development if you wish. But without doubt you have to ask the question, where was the expertise when this ASIC/FPGA scheme was being developed when any amateur miner could have probably told Gardin how mining worked. It also complements the fiasco with the CGMiner software.",

Those are technical claims, whether you like the label or not. The issue isn\u2019t that you mention 4.3 billion nonces or TH/s. The issue is that you take a self-constructed interpretation of partial disclosures, layer assumptions on top, and then present the result as a definitive failure of the technology, while dismissing any alternative interpretation as \u201cword salad\u201d. That\u2019s not analysis; it\u2019s narrative certainty built on inference. You say \u201cGardin has continually changed the story\u201d, yet you haven\u2019t demonstrated a contradiction in the RNSs, only that your interpretation has shifted as new descriptions were released. Developmental clarification is not the same thing as cover-up. And telling people to \u201cGoogle the terms\u201d , pleaaaaase.

I'll just paste my conclusion here Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !\" You a tually consider this a 'technical conclusion' ? I'm assuming you think its technical because of the text 4.3 Billion NONCES - 1 TH/s hasher - 8.3 Ms and microprocessor Bizzare. Truly Bizarre please Google these terms to aid your understanding",

You are saying the template is evaluated as a job lot but still it is  instances are being discarded  I.e. identical to the hardware method. Common sense tells us we would expect both forms of Method C to operate similarly. The difference is Gardin said initially that an ASIC was needed because the Oracle had to match the ASIC throughput.  This was incorrect, it is feasible that a microprocessor can hash a new Merkle root and evaluate the resulting altered template during the time the current Merkle root template is being hashed 4.3 billion times. So Gardin and his team of so called experts didn't understand the process",

A few key points for readers: Header vs instance is being deliberately collapsed The post repeatedly asserts that a \u201cheader\u201d and an \u201cinstance of a header\u201d are the same thing. They are not used interchangeably in QBT\u2019s disclosures. Instances refer to nonce-variant hash attempts. Header assessment refers to evaluating block templates / header states before committing full ASIC hash cycles. Re-labelling them as identical is the author\u2019s interpretation, not a fact established by QBT or the RNS. Throughput arguments miss the architectural claim The argument assumes the Oracle must compete with ASIC throughput on a like-for-like basis. That is not what Method C claims. The claim is probabilistic pre-selection, not brute-force substitution. Saying \u201cASICs are faster\u201d is irrelevant if the process being described is filtering, not hashing. \u201cHe changed the story\u201d is assertion, not evidence What\u2019s actually happened is an evolution from hardware to software description as different implementations are explored. That is explicitly disclosed. No evidence is provided that anything has been \u201ccovered up\u201d ,only that the author now disagrees with the interpretation. Speculation is being presented as forensic conclusion Phrases like \u201cwe deduce\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d, and \u201cGardin didn\u2019t understand\u201d are opinion, not fact \u2014 yet they are framed as definitive findings. In short, this post does not introduce new information.

          "content": "Method C software running on the operating system of the miner performs real time assessment of different headers, we are told by the web site.  The first puzzle is what does Gardin mean by different headers. The header template provided by the pool forms the core of the header to be hashed. Most fields are immutable but 2 fields are very important and mutable, the Merkle root and the 32-bit NONCE field. To form different headers these fields are changed to produce trillions of slightly different headers.  The NONCE field has one job, to cycle or increment from 0 to 4.3 billion. For a 1 TH/s miner this takes 8.6 ms, a mere blink of an eye. Every time a single bit changes in the Merkle root the NONCE cycles through 4.3 billion values for that variation of the header. Of course for multi chip ASIC rigs  the time drops equivalently, the latest mining rigs  can achieve 1,000 TH/s so will cycle the NONCE in 8.6 microseconds. What happens to the header after assessment by the Oracle is complete?  We know the answer to that \u201c this approach avoids processing a large number of headers which have little, or no probability to generate a hash above the pool target\u201d In other words that header is discarded and is not hashed, as we have been led to believe from previous descriptions of Method C.  How is this different from the brute force approach using \u201cinstances of Headers\u201d ? Again from the web site description \u201c Unlike current standard BTC mining approach, based on a search, where the mining rig runs as many Tera hashes per second as possible, during the circa\u201d 10 minutes allowance for each block, with no special criteria on which instances of the header to process first, also described as brute force\u201d We deduce that an instance of a header is simply a specific header, what at one time was called an input to SHA256. Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !",

It seems that QBT are now doing something very different from thier prospectus. \"Reasons for listing: The purpose of the Placing is to raise funds to invest in and develop further innovative concepts which the Directors believe can become successful commercial enterprises. Funds are also required to continue to raise the level of in-house expertise and to look at initiatives to build the Brainspark brand outside the UK, particularly in continental Europe.\" Hmm. That does not seem to have gine very well. Maybe tbey need another 25 years? \"Dividends: The Company is seeking primarily to achieve capital growth for its shareholders. It is not the present intention of the Directors to pay a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.\" Have shareholders been rewarded with capital growth? When listed, the shares were 125p. Today they are 0.575p. That's a 99.54% loss. Hmm. https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/images/Brainspark_prospectus1.pdf",

Under the accrual accounting method\u2014the standard for most mid-to-large businesses and public companies\u2014revenue is recognized when it is earned, which occurs at the moment of delivery, regardless of when the customer actually pays. Revenue Recognition Principles The relationship between delivery and revenue is governed by the Revenue Recognition Principle (standardized internationally as IFRS 15 and in the U.S. as ASC 606). These standards state that revenue is recognized when a company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer. Product Delivery: Revenue is typically recognized at a single point in time when physical possession or legal title transfers to the buyer. Service Delivery: Revenue is often recognized over time as the service is performed. For example, a monthly subscription service generates revenue incrementally each day the service is available to the user\"",

I'm curious to know why anyone still believes that QBT's business model will lead to anything commercially viable? Am I wrong in saying that the company has released a series of varying narratives over the years, but no evidence of any real substantive progress? You've had Method's A, B, C, SAAS, ASIC development and Quantum, with commercialisation usually touted to arrive in the following year, but then it all goes quiet before a new narrative comes out. I'm not saying QBT aren't trying to achieve their commercial goals, but are those goals viable on their budget? How many registered employee's does the company have? Are the researchers and developers just working on the projects in their spare time, more like hobbyists who might reap future reward? My view is that the miners who spend Billions building datacenters and filling them with rigs, likely have far larger budgets to develop their own proprietary software and systems to enhance their mining operations, and protect the secrecy of their systems to maintain advantage over competitors. Something else to consider is that with each halving mining profits reduce and Datacenters are likely to move operations away from mining and into AI. I've always believed that Bitcoin is built on false narratives and will eventually fail for whatever reason. Maybe power hungry AI will displace Crypto mining as the next big thing, since AI appears to be the next big thing to bubble up; I can see how AI is useful, whereas I view Bitcoin as useless. Will AI finally kill Bitcoin? Maybe. AI is as power hungry as BTC mining, the Datacenters will likely choose one over another dependent on ROI, I believe AI will win over BTC mining.",

The second parties I.e. the 3 ASIC manufacturers subject to a NDA and who have also built their own mining rigs. The same rigs that QBT is supposedly installing their software on. It is assumed each arrangement has a seperate set of terms. It isn't semantics, there are only first and multiple second parties involved here.  It is a convention to describe the concerned parties so. Invent your own definitions if you wish but you may find it difficult communicating with the rest of the English speaking world.

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

          "content": "The addition of Canaccord as a second market maker generally improves liquidity and price transparency, because it introduces competition into the quoting process. If one market maker were hypothetically suppressing price through wider spreads, slower bid support, or inventory positioning, another market maker can step in to compete for order flow by offering tighter spreads or better pricing. Multiple market makers also distribute risk and reduce reliance on a single liquidity provider, which can make it harder for any one participant to influence short-term price direction. In practice, this usually leads to smoother trading, improved execution for buyers and sellers, and a more balanced order book.",

Here is the status of QBT's production timeline: Software Commercialization Phase: QBT is currently transitioning from R&D to commercial application, having entered into three Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with ASIC manufacturers to test its Method C AI Oracle on their mining rigs at its Milan laboratory. Live Testing (2026): As of Feb 2026, QBT reported progress on integrating its software with third-party hardware following meetings at the Nashville Energy & Mining Summit. Shift to Software Focus: QBT deprioritized a hardware-based chip in favor of a software-based approach (SaaS), which allows for a faster rollout, with commercialization expected \"later this year\". Operational Focus: The company is currently engaged in \"fine-tuning\" its algorithms, with CEO Francesco Gardin indicating that the company is on the verge of turning its technology into commercial products. While no specific \"launch date\" for mass production was given in the Feb 2026, the company is in the final phases of testing and transitioning toward active commercial deployment in the 2025-2026 cycle",

Everyone does it. But switching from extreme bullish conviction to extreme failure certainty while presenting both as \u201cfact\u201d raises serious credibility questions. Investors should ask themselves: \u2022 Was the original bullish certainty wrong? \u2022 Is the current bearish certainty evidence-based or emotionally driven? \u2022 Why is the same certainty language being used in opposite directions? \u2022 Is the goal discussion \u2014 or sentiment influence? This matters because newer investors often assume long-term posters are consistent, reliable or evidence-driven. Posting history here shows conviction has flipped 180\u00b0 while the communication style has stayed the same \u2014 strong certainty, emotive language, and persuasion framing. That is not balanced analysis. That is narrative positioning. Readers should be extremely cautious when any poster: \u2022 Presents opinion as fact \u2022 Uses absolute outcome language repeatedly \u2022 Shifts stance dramatically while maintaining certainty tone \u2022 Focuses on emotional reaction rather than verifiable data The safest investment decisions are always based on: \u2022 Official RNS disclosures \u2022 Verifiable technical or commercial milestones \u2022 Independent research \u2022 Not forum personalities or conviction strength Always review full posting history \u2014 not just current sentiment.",

But pretending recurring posting waves are just random discussion is increasingly hard to accept when the same usernames appear, using the same themes, at the same trigger points. Let\u2019s be blunt. Every RNS or interview release is followed by a near-identical sequence: \u2022 Immediate worst-case certainty posts (failure, insolvency, delisting, fraud suggestions) \u2022 Follow-up reinforcement posts comparing QBT to historic AIM failures \u2022 Long retrospective posts selectively quoting historic RNS lines to construct failure narratives \u2022 Additional posts reframing progress delays as proof of incompetence or deception \u2022 Short one-liners reinforcing \u201cconsensus negativity\u201d This is not new. It is predictable,repeated and reported. Calling the company a \u201cskeleton non commercial project\u201d is not fact \u2014 it is opinion. Stating opinion as inevitability repeatedly is narrative building, not analysis. Claiming AIM losses justify assuming failure here is also flawed logic. Risk exists across AIM. It is not evidence of outcome for any specific company. No issue with scepticism. The issue is when scepticism is presented as certainty and repeated until newer investors assume it is established truth. Readers should ask themselves: \u2022 Are new facts being introduced? \u2022 Or are historic statements being recycled to reinforce sentiment? \u2022 Are timelines being debated fairly or selectively? \u2022 Are posters invested or repeatedly focused on discouraging investment? Debate is healthy. Narrative campaigning is something different.",

You've already acknowledged that we are all different posters, which is a sensible conclusion based upon writing styles and phrases used. Of course if you go to most other boards you will see the same words and phrases used. Not surprising really is it, everyone is using  the same language about the same subjects. The same characters exist and post with the same rang of skills and experience. There's the moronic one-liners \" this is going to explode on news\" etc. The poster that can't help but post disguised swear words, the insulted. Absolute fanatical believers and disbelievers. The 'expert' on the company and the opposite poster that knows nothing. So it goes on, pick a board and read it! Me, I'm not much for great conspiracies but AIM has been shown to be very misleading and created huge losses for private investors.  Therefore, I suspect there are people paid to push agendas here maybe and elsewhere but why pay when the British public do it for you and for free? Personally I post here without help or hindrance from anyone else. What I write are my own words using my own ideas. Very occasionally I cite AI text but like others, at least honest posters, I note the use of AI assisted posts. I think QBT is a skeleton non commercial project, fleshed out by vague and ambiguous RNS and open to huge interpretation of their meaning and importance. So ends my sermon!",

This is simply an observation of how certain discussions repeatedly develop on this board, particularly after RNS or interview releases. Readers may wish to watch how some usernames tend to interact and how narratives build in stages. riceyboy84 Often introduces strong certainty or worst-case outcome posts such as \u201cend game\u201d, insolvency, delisting or investigation themes. These posts frequently appear early and set a negative sentiment anchor. wyt3fr0g and occasionally Pedrobull Often follow with short reinforcement comments or comparisons to failed AIM companies. These tend to increase perceived consensus rather than introduce new information. Phimx Frequently then builds longer posts quoting RNS history, highlighting contradictions or delays, and directly challenges bullish posters. This often provides technical justification to earlier sentiment posts. Hexam Often reinforces technical or commercial plausibility concerns using conditional logic (for example questioning whether testing has worked or whether partners are engaged). This tends to add credibility to earlier sceptical arguments. UserSteve Regularly expands discussions into historical company performance, long-term revenue absence, and share price decline over many years. This often reframes current debate into a broader historic failure narrative. Plutuq Often reinforces investor frustration or timeline disappointment themes, particularly around delivery expectations versus results. Again, none of the above means any poster is correct or incorrect. It simply shows how forum sentiment can build through layered interaction between the same regular contributors. Readers may find it useful to separate: \u2022 Evidence in official disclosures \u2022 Interpretation of that evidence \u2022 Repetition of narratives \u2022 Emotional certainty language . Explore these users posting history (it reveals a lot) Always worth forming your own view based on primary company information rather than thread momentum. Just sharing as an observation for awareness, particularly for newer investors who may not have seen how these discussion cycles tend to repeat.",

You will see the chart shows the share price has fallen from 30,500p (in April 2000) to 0.53p today. mrhanji said \"What we should be focused on is the rns and the developments over the past couple of years..\" Better still, we should look at all the RNSs. It is no secret that there is no RNS in the company's 26-year history that announces a commercial product, or any significant and sustained revenue. Every commercial project appears to have failed, and the company constantly changes to another project. It seems perfectly obvious to me that this explains the monumental erosion of value.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction. IP Strategy: QBT is focusing on patenting its core AI Oracle technology, though some developments are kept as trade secrets. The company describes this period as a \"very, very intense and busy\" time as they move towards full commercialization of their proprietary AI, which aims to boost hashing power without requiring significant extra energy.",

It is unbelievable that any ASIC manufacturer would not understand the requirements to carry out a detailed evaluation from day1. Evaluating and testing FPGA and ASIC designs represent a very big percentage of the manufacturing cycle. This is just too absurd  to be true. Who was paying for all the work to be done? There was no contract/deal announced, compare with the recent interview and the claims that legal paperwork has to be completed on top of the NDAs. RNS: 24 June 2024 \" QBT is currently collaborating with two ASIC chip manufacturers who are about to begin detailed evaluations of Method \" RNS 5 December 2025 \" Joint analysis of the hardware version of Method C AI Oracle had previously commenced with one of the three ASIC manufacturers, as announced on 8 April 2025. However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved much faster with this approach. Therefore, in light of the above, QBT's involvement in a design collaboration for a new ASIC with this or any other ASIC manufacturer will now represent the second phase of any commercial relationship, following a successful roll-out of the software version of Method C.\"",

          "content": "AI Overview Based on recent interviews with Proactive Investors, Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) is in a high-intensity phase of commercializing its AI-driven Bitcoin mining technology, with a particular focus on its \"Method C\" AI Oracle. Here are the key takeaways from recent QBT interviews with CEO Francesco Gardin: 1. Key Technology Developments Method C AI Oracle: This is the main focus, designed to improve the efficiency of existing ASIC mining hardware. It has been refined to operate in real-time using FPGA hardware, with the aim of achieving roughly a 30% increase in \"quality hashes\" (efficiency). Software-Only Deployment: To accelerate time-to-market, QBT shifted from a hardware-intensive approach to a software-only version of Method C, cutting deployment time from 18 months to just a few weeks. Methods A & B: These methods are also being developed, with ongoing negotiations to integrate them into aftermarket control boards for mining rigs. 2. Commercialization & Strategic Partnerships ASIC Partnerships: QBT has signed multiple Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with major, but unnamed, ASIC manufacturers to test the Method C AI Oracle on their machines. Testing Phase: The company is currently testing its technology in a Milan laboratory, focusing on legacy S9 miners as a proof of concept. Target Market: The technology is aimed at helping smaller or mid-sized miners, as well as those using older hardware, to close the efficiency gap with market leaders. Revenue Model: QBT is exploring several revenue avenues, including licensing fees, share of hash rates (profit sharing), and direct mining. 3. Recent Strategic Updates (Late 2025/Early 2026) Positive Feedback: The technology was well-received at a recent US Bitcoin conference, validating the company's direction. IP Strategy: QBT is focusing on patenting its core AI Oracle technology, though some developments are kept as trade secrets. The company describes this period as a \"very, very intense and busy\" time as they move towards full commercialization of their proprietary AI, which aims to boost hashing power without requiring significant extra energy.",

And just a few hours later the interview came out addressing tge confusion this statement caused. So, within a few hours after the 7am publication,  presumably QBT received several calls to clarify this statement, and were able to include addressing the issue in the interview. All within a few hours. Quite impressive, really. If only QBT responded to calls for clarification in this manner on a regular basis!!",

In the same period QBT's share price has dropped 17% from 0.63p to 0.525p When bitcoin did a 6-bagger, QBT fell. When bitcoin halved in value, QBT fell. Thus there is no relationship between BTC and QBT prices. To me, this strongly suggests that the market knows that QBT is not related to BTC. Rather, the market knows that QBT is oprtating in another area. QBT's spikes have been on the back of hopeful RNSs, all of which failed to result in deals and revenue. So it seems to me that QBT's main 'product' is hope itself, which it sellsto the market by way of fundraises. And this hope is often hyped by Gardin during interviews. Just my take on things. Will happily be proved wrong by the announcement of a material commercial deal, or by the publishing of validation of QBT's Methods by an trusted independent company (such as one of the Big 4)  or reputable newspaper (such as The Financial Times or Computer Weekly).",

The arrogance and his patronising manner at the end of the interview was not good! The FACT is if you're a going to post videos at the beginning of 2024 stating revenue this year and then do it again a year later and still nothing, what do you think would happen? Another FACT is, there are no signed deals or progress reports with respected ASIC chip manufacturers. The NDAs route aren't going to increase the SP - the market isn't stupid. I don't understand what they need to protect? Surely knowing who they're talking to would help their cause with investors? I see this falling below 0.0050p very soon.

So this is creating a new, entirely new situation in the sector. Finally you have chips available in quantities, and you have already have the entire design of a system, of, of, a, a, an ecosystem for mining, and this is for us is a game-changer because we expect, or the industry expect, that there will be many manufacturers who will assemble systems, starting from this open source designs, and therefore there will be more companies offering their systems, which will bring a very healthy change in this market dominated by 99% by the three manufacturers in China. Host: Francesco, there's been confusion around partial access to source code. Can you explain in simple terms what access QBT has today, and what it doesn't yet have? Gardin: Yeah, that's has to do with the three, ahh, umm, with three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, because there is substantial amount of source code and they start to release it to us, err, umm, partially, er, because, er, erm, we wouldn't have anyway the, the ability to deal with three, err, different operating system [sic], ahh, three different drivers, and so that's something that is going on incrementally, err, but, ahh, it's, it's part of, of an agreed, ahh, erm, path, er, that, er, we have, er, defined with this, er, three potential partners. Host: Mmm. I mean, ahh, investors are keen to understand progress with those partners. How would you describe the current stage of those relationships and why the phase is taking time? Gardin: Ahhh, well, I mean *laughs* the, say that, ahh, the main focus with the three manufacturers, but not the only but main work focus is Method C. Method C you need to train the neural network [sic] and train it on the specific ASICs that will be in the machine. So the training is very ASIC oriented, specific ASIC oriented, and that's not something you do overnight, and to get these machines there is legal paperwork because one thing is to sign an NDA, the other thing is to sign all the guarantees for the software, the proprietary software that they share, the design of this ASIC because we need to understand how they work internally, the specs of these ASICs which are not necessarily in the public domain, so, I mean, it's not as simple as I sign an NDA, I come and pick up a machine tomorrow. *laughs and shakes head* Unfortunately it doesn't work like that.

I'm joined by Francesco Gardin, the CEO of Quantum Blockchain Technologies. Francesco, very good to speak with you. Your update todays follows a positive industry conference rather than a single breakthrough. What was the key takeaway for QBT from attending the Nashville event? Gardin: Ok, good morning, Stephen. Ahh, the Bitcoin Park in Nashville is one of the center [sic] ah, in the US of the bitcoin culture. And so, ah, attending this events is always very important because it's the best way to network with the real professionals in the sector. Err, so it's been, ahh, one-and-a-half days but extremely intensive with the many, many, many, many side meetings that we had with the main players, especially with three, ahh, manufacturers of ASIC [sic] for bitcoin mining that we, ah, have signed the NDA with, and we are progressing, ahh, work with them, which is extremely good, and it's also good to show your face there and to show your physical presence together with our US consultants. Ahh, the, errm, so this is part of the normal commercial relationship, err, business relationship that you have to entertain and also monitor any development in the industry. Apart from this, it was very important for us also because one of the major problem that we had to face in the past is that 99% of the market is dominated by the Chinese manufacturers, and their policy is that no specs on the ASICs, err, and no availability of access to the software which runs on their mining rigs. Therefore that fact that now, finally, other after this gigantic effort, ahh, there is this whole stack available which is open source from the design of the hashing boards, design of control boards, the software which controls it, the even a pool, now is all open source which means that we can, ah, ah, as well as working with the three partners, the ASIC manufacturers, ...

The interview does indicate continued technical and partnership progress rather than project inactivity. As always, investors should weigh both opportunities and risks and rely on primary disclosures when forming conclusions. Especially when the hoards are claiming white is black.",

Thus there are apparent inconsistencies between the RNSs and the public statements from the CEO.

          "content": "How Narratives Sometimes Form Worth remembering that forum sentiment doesn\u2019t always build randomly. There\u2019s a common pattern that appears across many AIM and small-cap boards and in particular this. RNS brings out droves. It usually starts with a strong negative or positive claim. Then follow-up posts repeat or reinforce it. Over time, repetition can make opinions feel like established facts, even when no new evidence has been added. You have seen this before right ? Another common tactic is presenting complex technical points in a way that suggests confusion or contradiction. Readers can mistake complexity for proof something is wrong. Examples of Common Posting Styles Seen Across Discussions: \u2022 Pedrobull \u2013 Often posts short, slogan-style negativity or repetition phrases that reinforce sentiment rather than introduce new information. \u2022 Phimx \u2013 Frequently posts longer technical or RNS-based interpretations, often highlighting perceived contradictions or uncertainty in company communications. \u2022 riceyboy84 \u2013 Commonly posts timeline predictions and worst-case scenario outcomes such as delisting or failure, usually framed as inevitability. \u2022 KoolKat15 \u2013 Often focuses on investor protection arguments, confidence issues, and the absence of revenue or deals, typically presented in detailed opinion posts. \u2022 allforprofit \u2013 Tends to use strong criticism of leadership capability or company direction, often framed as performance concern commentary. \u2022 0134 \u2013 Regularly raises concerns around funding, placings, or financial sustainability speculation. \u2022 Plutuq \u2013 Often posts probability or price prediction style commentary suggesting likely short-term trading outcomes. \u2022 Awl007 \u2013 Typically posts shorter reinforcement or agreement style comments that echo broader sentiment already expressed. \u2022 mrhanji \u2013 Usually posts bullish outlook commentary, often focusing on potential partnerships, future valuation upside, or encouraging holders to ignore negative sentiment. These observations relate to posting style patterns only and form part of normal forum debate dynamics seen across many shares and boards. But WHY so many self proclaimed uninvested users spreading negativity ? None of this means criticism or support is invalid. Healthy debate is important. It simply means investors should separate: \u2022 Evidence \u2022 Interpretation \u2022 Repetition \u2022 Emotion Always worth checking source material yourself rather than relying purely on forum consensus.",

          "content": "Just listened to the interview, another confusing talk! Previously he has stated  \"However, due to the need for the hardware version to be integrated into the ASIC architecture, a process which could take up to 18 months for the new chip to come to market, it has been mutually agreed to give operational priority to the new software version, as a commercial roll-out is expected to be achieved\" Fine, but in the interview he talks about training the Oracle and it has to be specifically the ASIC used in  the machines. QBT have to understand how the ASICs work internally. He goes onto say there is legal paperwork for the software and it's not as simple as signing a NDA and coming to pick up the machine tomorrow. It is confusing because we don't know if he's talking about the soft or hard Method C. We know fro. RNS 12 Nov 2025 \" the performance of this new software-only version is independent of the ASIC being used in the miner.\" So what on earth was this update about? PS: incidentally what was learned, after waffling in other RNS about the 10,000s of Chinese after market boards, which I believe was another one of his focal points for revenue, the Chinese were giving nothing away to enable any progress. No ASIC or software details. Obviously if the Chinese were actually approached, they had no interest in what Gardin had to offer.",

The reason is simple, there are no deals/partnerships/revenue now or for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, this will end in tears for all LTH's. The bullish sentiment from certain posters is plain false in my opinion and everyone should call this company out because even though many understand the risks involved, they've been told false information and it's wrong! You can't get away from the nonsense that has been released in RNSs, videos and interviews. This behaviour should be reported and the authorities should act again this misinformation.",

The process has reached the stage where these three companies will now be needing to make their mining rigs available to QBT's testing team at its laboratory in Milan, with access to their relevant source code...\" So here we are 2 months later and Gardin is supposedly still discussing delivery of miners and software from the NDA companies.

Hexam said \"... but the most bizarre thing in this weird RNS is that they say the conference gave the opportunity of 'allowing QBT\u2019s management team to engage with those ASIC manufacturers which have signed NDAs with the Company.'\" Very odd. It makes an image pop into my head of Gardin cornering an NDA signatory in the bar and repeatedly asking \"Have you sent us sime rigs yet, guv?\". But I agree with you - choosing to converse during conferences rather than via phone, video call. email, etc. strongly suggests they're just not that into QBT. Mind you, if the project only progresses after discussions every few months at bitcoin conferences, that could support the theory that this is a lifestyle company. Are those companies not answering QBT\u2019s call and emails? Why do they need a conference to engage with them?",

What\u2019s actually happening is simpler: QBT has been running an R&D programme with multiple approaches, descriptions have evolved as implementations are tested, progress has been slower than hoped (as is common in R&D), and outcomes ultimately depend on independent verification, not forum rhetoric. None of that proves success, but neither does repetition of negative narratives prove failure. The only things that will settle this are evidence, testing results, and disclosures.

The RNS most definitely did not say that they *will* produce an ASIC. But in the 3 Dec 2021 public interview, their CEO Gardin *did* say that QBT's target was to produce an ASIC that was, at a minumum, twice as fast as the keading ASIC at the time, within one year. His guidance is not caveated; these are stated as definites. Gardin states \"The chip that *we will produce*...\". This is definite guidance with no caveats, if, buts, mights, or maybes. Gardin also states the chip \"...will be more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip...\". Again, this is definite performance guidance with no caveats. Gardin also states \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\". Here the CEO is giving guidance that their target is to produce the ASIC in a year. No caveats at all. There are two ways to look at this. The first is to accept that QBT completely failed to achieve their guidance target stated publically by their CEO. The second is to accept that anything their CEOs say in public interviews is unreliable, may not reflect reality, and should not be used to influence your investment decisions.",

Investors would have got this impresdion from the public statements of CEO Gardin during the 3 Dec 2021 Proactive Investor interview (link at bottom). Here are some of Gardin's statements regarding the ASIC: At 03:05 Gardin says \"It was quite complex to be able to attract the attention of this large [5nm ASIC] manufacturer and actually being able to engage them and to book some production time at the beginning of Q1 2023\" At 04:14 Gardin says \"The chip that we will produce will be far more faster than just twice as much. Twice as much faster is the minimum target for our chip, but we are confident that it will be much, much faster when we introduce the results of the second patent\" and \"I emphasise that [these results] are a 1 year away target.\" Then at 05:14 Gardin says \"We are getting extraordinary results from our AI team which means if we can incorporate those results into our chip, our chip could be 100 times, 1000 times faster.\" But as Mikeydj rightly posted, interviews are not guidance and can be disregarded. I would go further and will state the obvious: that after this debacle, all of Gardin's claims during interviews can be safely ignored as hopelessly fantastical delusions of grandeur which have never have and never will be borne out in the real world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyx67cydEMI",

I refer to these companies as having non-commercial projects. In general they have some semblance of a project to justify loosely what they make claims for. Usually it is difficult to determine exactly what technology they actually have and under what conditions or limits their claims are valid e.g. what references they use for measurement. Again, in general they claim many discussions are taking place but rarely do these discussions reach a conclusion or the results informed to shareholders. Many placings and consolidation take place and employees are minimal. In short everything is vague and difficult to pin down. I very much doubt I have ever called this a scam,",

It certainly doesn't mean I was mistake in thinking very few people here understand Bitcoin mining. As for reframing disagreement as ignorance, I'm not convinced  you trying to link disagreement through discussion and engagement to my observation of  investors ignorance is valid.  There is no disagreement with 'technical' speculation or inference simply because ignorance prevents the ignorant from disagreeing.More likely disagreement occurs for subjects where there is little ignorance but causal from differing variations and expectations in inference of  vague and poorly determined and presented factual content.

Lol wtf bob mined bitcoin ...jeez he must know abit more i guess...what a joke \"Appointment of Strategic AdviserFormer Intel Blockscale Executive Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focused on an R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jose Rios as Strategic Adviser. Mr. Rios is the former General Manager of Blockchain and Business Solutions in the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel Corp, where he spent 25 years. He was instrumental in the Blockscale ASIC project - Intel's dedicated chip for Bitcoin mining - and he brings extensive expertise in ASIC chip design, production and proprietary architecture development to QBT. Mr. Rios has been privately consulting for the Company since the latter part of 2023, and has now agreed to accept the position of Strategic Adviser. He has already played a pivotal role in forging key relationships with some of the leading players in the global Bitcoin industry and he has also provided strategic guidance on the market positioning of QBT's technology. Mr. Rios has actively assisted QBT at major industry events including, Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, Bitcoin Disrupt 2024 in Miami and Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, with plans to attend Amsterdam Bitcoin 2024. His close involvement with the Company will ensure QBT's growing recognition at the forefront of industry events and developments. Francesco Gardin, CEO and Chairman of QBT, commented: \"QBT was a keen supporter of Intel's Blockscale project, from the end 2022 to the early months of 2023, when the ASIC chip production was discontinued. Around that time, we were introduced to Mr Rios, its project manager and, following a period of mutual understanding into what QBT was looking to create, Jose initially agreed to consult for the Company in a private capacity. This has resulted in extremely valuable insights for QBT with regards to the Bitcoin industry, the major players in the sector and the analysis of key trends. \"Today's announcement that Mr Rios has agreed to become Strategic Adviser is an important step for us and one which we value very highly knowing the contribution he will bring to the Company.\" About Jose Rios:Mr. Rios, aged 51, is a seasoned technology executive with over two decades of experience in sales, engineering and product development within the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley. Jose has a strong background in custom silicon design, having overseen multiple high-performance computing projects across AI, automotive and blockchain sectors. His expertise spans from initial concept through to production, with a focus on optimising solutions for complex, data-intensive workloads.

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin? Your attacks on my posts revolve around, wordplay and semantics, literal meanings. definitions and phraseology. as if we are presenting evidence in a court of law.

You agreed with my basic hashing description which established it was not essential to place the Oracle on a hashing ASIC. The whole ASIC saga itself is worthy of an in-depth study for its sheer absurdity. It basically indicated to me and others that Gardin wasn't being guided by an expert team.  Gardin fails to publish any sensible scientific data which can be held to scrutiny. The only performance figures for Method C software is, i believe \"north of 10%\" do you expect sensible discussion from vague amateurish  statements like that from Gardin?

What you are describing is your reconstruction of how Method C must have evolved, based on your current understanding of mining architecture. That is not the same thing as demonstrating a contradiction in disclosed statements. Two points matter here: Change of implementation detail is not a contradiction of claim The core claim has remained that an AI-driven oracle can influence which work is prioritised or discarded before full hashing. Whether that logic sits on an ASIC, FPGA, control board, or software layer  is an implementation choice, not a reversal of principle. R&D projects routinely move functionality across layers as constraints are better understood. You are explicitly speculating about motives and competence Phrases like \u201cI speculate that Gardin finally realised\u2026\u201d and \u201cignorance rather than development\u201d are interpretations, not facts. You may believe them to be likely, but they are not supported by any evidence stating \u201cthis approach was abandoned because we misunderstood mining\u201d. Your three-stage description of mining is broadly accepted,  but it doesn\u2019t prove that earlier descriptions were false, only that you believe they were inefficient or unnecessary. Inefficiency is not  impossibility, and refinement not  cover-up. So we\u2019re back at the same distinction: You are arguing that evolving technical descriptions imply incompetence. I am saying that, absent of a disclosed contradiction, that conclusion is not established fact, yet you claim it fact in an authoritative manner, without context of how and why  we are expected to give you credit, or even benefit of doubt.  Why would i buy double glazing of a person off a person who cannot quantify their technical knowledge and authoritative views  of the products. Readers can decide which interpretation they find more persuasive , but it\u2019s important to be clear about where disclosure ends and inference begins.",

I don't think that is in dispute, go read several RNS and listen to interviews. My observation is, that was incorrect. Why was that? Because Gardin didn't understand the hashing/mining process. This at odds with his admissions of having a team of around 20 experts working for him. As I have explained creating headers to be hashed by a 1 TH/s miner should be possible but the time to evaluate each new header is unknown. Note by headers I mean modification of the header template provided by the pool by changing the Merkle root (as the extra-NONCE) but before it is sent to the ASIC I speculate that Gardin finally realised how hashing was being performed by the ASIC and realised that an Oracle on an ASIC was not necessary. To be clear hashing of the header can be divided into 3 basic stages 1.  Assemble the header from the information supplied by the pool, there is only one supplied. Performed by.  the control system 2. Send to ASIC and hash with  4.3 billion different NONCEs. If no result 3. Change Merkle root to create new variation of the original header, again performed by control system and repeat. My conclusion from the above: The story has changed it changed because of ignorance rather than development but you can spin it as development if you wish. But without doubt you have to ask the question, where was the expertise when this ASIC/FPGA scheme was being developed when any amateur miner could have probably told Gardin how mining worked. It also complements the fiasco with the CGMiner software.",

I'll just paste my conclusion here Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !\" You a tually consider this a 'technical conclusion' ? I'm assuming you think its technical because of the text 4.3 Billion NONCES - 1 TH/s hasher - 8.3 Ms and microprocessor Bizzare. Truly Bizarre please Google these terms to aid your understanding",

You are saying the template is evaluated as a job lot but still it is  instances are being discarded  I.e. identical to the hardware method. Common sense tells us we would expect both forms of Method C to operate similarly. The difference is Gardin said initially that an ASIC was needed because the Oracle had to match the ASIC throughput.  This was incorrect, it is feasible that a microprocessor can hash a new Merkle root and evaluate the resulting altered template during the time the current Merkle root template is being hashed 4.3 billion times. So Gardin and his team of so called experts didn't understand the process",

          "content": "This is a classic example of conclusion-first reasoning wrapped in technical verbosity. A few key points for readers: Header vs instance is being deliberately collapsed The post repeatedly asserts that a \u201cheader\u201d and an \u201cinstance of a header\u201d are the same thing. They are not used interchangeably in QBT\u2019s disclosures. Instances refer to nonce-variant hash attempts. Header assessment refers to evaluating block templates / header states before committing full ASIC hash cycles. Re-labelling them as identical is the author\u2019s interpretation, not a fact established by QBT or the RNS. Throughput arguments miss the architectural claim The argument assumes the Oracle must compete with ASIC throughput on a like-for-like basis. That is not what Method C claims. The claim is probabilistic pre-selection, not brute-force substitution. Saying \u201cASICs are faster\u201d is irrelevant if the process being described is filtering, not hashing. \u201cHe changed the story\u201d is assertion, not evidence What\u2019s actually happened is an evolution from hardware to software description as different implementations are explored. That is explicitly disclosed. No evidence is provided that anything has been \u201ccovered up\u201d ,only that the author now disagrees with the interpretation. Speculation is being presented as forensic conclusion Phrases like \u201cwe deduce\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d, and \u201cGardin didn\u2019t understand\u201d are opinion, not fact \u2014 yet they are framed as definitive findings. In short, this post does not introduce new information. It repackages a negative conclusion using technical language, relies on disputed definitions, and then treats those disputes as proof of failure. Readers can decide whether that advances understanding , or simply reinforces a predetermined narrative.",

          "content": "Method C software running on the operating system of the miner performs real time assessment of different headers, we are told by the web site.  The first puzzle is what does Gardin mean by different headers. The header template provided by the pool forms the core of the header to be hashed. Most fields are immutable but 2 fields are very important and mutable, the Merkle root and the 32-bit NONCE field. To form different headers these fields are changed to produce trillions of slightly different headers.  The NONCE field has one job, to cycle or increment from 0 to 4.3 billion. For a 1 TH/s miner this takes 8.6 ms, a mere blink of an eye. Every time a single bit changes in the Merkle root the NONCE cycles through 4.3 billion values for that variation of the header. Of course for multi chip ASIC rigs  the time drops equivalently, the latest mining rigs  can achieve 1,000 TH/s so will cycle the NONCE in 8.6 microseconds. What happens to the header after assessment by the Oracle is complete?  We know the answer to that \u201c this approach avoids processing a large number of headers which have little, or no probability to generate a hash above the pool target\u201d In other words that header is discarded and is not hashed, as we have been led to believe from previous descriptions of Method C.  How is this different from the brute force approach using \u201cinstances of Headers\u201d ? Again from the web site description \u201c Unlike current standard BTC mining approach, based on a search, where the mining rig runs as many Tera hashes per second as possible, during the circa\u201d 10 minutes allowance for each block, with no special criteria on which instances of the header to process first, also described as brute force\u201d We deduce that an instance of a header is simply a specific header, what at one time was called an input to SHA256. Conclusion: In a word salad, Gardin has just described the hardware method C as the software method. He claims the software method is now possible because headers are assessed and not instances but they are the same thing. The reality is Gardin didn\u2019t understand the hashing process, and neither did I. The hardware version never needed an ASIC to operate, it had the time period whilst the 4.3 billion NONCEs were being rolled to construct a new header. For a 1 TH/s hasher that time was 8.3 ms probably sufficient for a fast microprocessor to create a new header and assess if it was worth hashing. Gardin has continually changed the story as he has learned and covered up the flaws in his story. So much for a team of experts !",

Readers can draw their own conclusions, but this pattern , clustered responses, aligned framing, and emphasis on rhetoric over evidence  is distinct from organic debate.

It seems that QBT are now doing something very different from thier prospectus. \"Reasons for listing: The purpose of the Placing is to raise funds to invest in and develop further innovative concepts which the Directors believe can become successful commercial enterprises. Funds are also required to continue to raise the level of in-house expertise and to look at initiatives to build the Brainspark brand outside the UK, particularly in continental Europe.\" Hmm. That does not seem to have gine very well. Maybe tbey need another 25 years? \"Dividends: The Company is seeking primarily to achieve capital growth for its shareholders. It is not the present intention of the Directors to pay a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.\" Have shareholders been rewarded with capital growth? When listed, the shares were 125p. Today they are 0.575p. That's a 99.54% loss. Hmm. https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/images/Brainspark_prospectus1.pdf",

In business and accounting terms, yes, the delivery of a product or service is the primary indicator that revenue is being generated and can be officially recorded. Under the accrual accounting method\u2014the standard for most mid-to-large businesses and public companies\u2014revenue is recognized when it is earned, which occurs at the moment of delivery, regardless of when the customer actually pays. Revenue Recognition Principles The relationship between delivery and revenue is governed by the Revenue Recognition Principle (standardized internationally as IFRS 15 and in the U.S. as ASC 606). These standards state that revenue is recognized when a company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer. Product Delivery: Revenue is typically recognized at a single point in time when physical possession or legal title transfers to the buyer. Service Delivery: Revenue is often recognized over time as the service is performed. For example, a monthly subscription service generates revenue incrementally each day the service is available to the user\"",

What it has delivered and disclosed are patent filings, working prototypes, lab validation, and third-party testing programmes under NDA. Those are tangible deliverables in this phase of a technology lifecycle, whether you personally value them or not. Revenue generation comes after technical validation and partner integration. You know that, which is why \u201cno revenue yet\u201d gets recycled as a rhetorical endpoint rather than an analytical conclusion. If your claim is that R&D-stage delivery is meaningless unless revenue already exists, then the disagreement is philosophical, not factual. But that does not make the disclosures false, nor does it make the work \u201cundelivered\u201d. So the record is clear: delivery has occurred, commercialisation is pending.

I'm curious to know why anyone still believes that QBT's business model will lead to anything commercially viable? Am I wrong in saying that the company has released a series of varying narratives over the years, but no evidence of any real substantive progress? You've had Method's A, B, C, SAAS, ASIC development and Quantum, with commercialisation usually touted to arrive in the following year, but then it all goes quiet before a new narrative comes out. I'm not saying QBT aren't trying to achieve their commercial goals, but are those goals viable on their budget? How many registered employee's does the company have? Are the researchers and developers just working on the projects in their spare time, more like hobbyists who might reap future reward? My view is that the miners who spend Billions building datacenters and filling them with rigs, likely have far larger budgets to develop their own proprietary software and systems to enhance their mining operations, and protect the secrecy of their systems to maintain advantage over competitors. Something else to consider is that with each halving mining profits reduce and Datacenters are likely to move operations away from mining and into AI. I've always believed that Bitcoin is built on false narratives and will eventually fail for whatever reason. Maybe power hungry AI will displace Crypto mining as the next big thing, since AI appears to be the next big thing to bubble up; I can see how AI is useful, whereas I view Bitcoin as useless. Will AI finally kill Bitcoin? Maybe. AI is as power hungry as BTC mining, the Datacenters will likely choose one over another dependent on ROI, I believe AI will win over BTC mining.",

What expectations made them think they could outperform everyone else ??  Fantasy I guess. \"NDA signed to provide QBT with 5nm Technology for Proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC The board of Quantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT) is pleased to announce that it has made the key decision to focus on the development of the more efficient 5nm Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), rather than a 7nm ASIC (as announced on 5 November 2021), to use as its proprietary Bitcoin mining tool. This decision was taken following a recent market announcement by a leading international Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that it will use 5nm ASICs for its the next generation of Bitcoin miners, which it expects to release in the second half of 2022. Accordingly, QBT has updated its development programme for the prototyping and industrial manufacturing of its proprietary Bitcoin mining, to use the 5nm ASIC. Based on the Company\u2019s internal projections, it believes that its previously planned optimised 7nm ASIC, would run at the same speed as the proposed 5nm ASIC, as announced by the above-mentioned Bitcoin miner manufacturer; this calculation is assuming the same number of ASICs will be used in the next mining model, as the above-mentioned miner currently applies to its existing model. The rationale to move from a 7nm to 5nm, is because the estimated speed of QBT\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin mining ASIC is expected to be at least twice as fast as the leading international Bitcoin miner manufacturer, before taking into account the optimisations of a second patent under development, which are yet to be factored in.\"",

          "content": "Based on Quantum Blockchain Technologies\u2019 (LSE: QBT) most recent financial reports and historical fundraising patterns, here is an analysis of their likely cash runway and funding needs. 1. Current Cash Position and Burn Rate - Cash Balance: As of June 30, 2025, QBT reported a cash position of \u20ac1.7 million. This was a significant increase from \u20ac600,000 at the end of 2024, largely due to a fundraising \"placing\" in January 2025. \u200b - Administrative Expenses: The company reported administrative expenses of \u20ac1.5 million for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025). \u200b - Estimated Burn Rate: Based on these figures, QBT's average monthly burn rate (operational overhead and R&D) is approximately \u20ac250,000 per month. 2. Estimated Runway Calculation Assuming the burn rate remains consistent (or slightly increases as they move into commercialization): - Total Funds as of July 2024: \u20ac1.7 million. \u200b - Estimated Monthly Burn: ~\u20ac250,000. \u200b - Calculated Runway: Approximately 6.8 months from the end of June 2025. This would place their \"zero cash\" date around January or February 2026. 3. Likely Timing for the Next Placing Publicly traded R&D companies rarely wait until their cash reaches zero to raise more capital, as they need a buffer for \"going concern\" status in audits. - Q1 2026 Expectation: QBT has established a pattern of raising funds in the first quarter of the year (e.g., their placing in January 2025). \u200b - Trigger Points: Investors should watch for a placing announcement in early 2026, likely coinciding with updates on their ASIC manufacturer partnership or further progress on the SIPEM legal recovery. 4. Factors That Could Change the Timing - Commercial Revenue: If QBT successfully licenses its \"Method C\" AI Oracle to a major mining pool or ASIC manufacturer in late 2025, they could generate upfront licensing fees that extend their runway without a share placing. \u200b - SIPEM Damages: While a Venice court awarded them \u20ac6.2 million, the 2025 appeal process means this cash is unlikely to arrive in time to prevent the next funding round. \u200b - R&D Acceleration: If they choose to fast-track the hardware production of their binary decision tree chips, the burn rate could spike, necessitating a placing sooner (late Q4 2025). Summary: Unless a significant licensing deal is signed before the end of the year, QBT will likely need to conduct a new share placing by January\u2013March 2026 to ensure sufficient working capital for the remainder of that year.",

In the last sentence you urge people to do their own research. So I looked at your posting history. Since 2021 you have made numerous hopeful posts and predictions about what's to come. None of your hopes and predictions have come to pass. Personally, I will disregard all your posts as failed overly optimistic ramping. Here is a list: \"...hugely confident ... fingers crossed for mining RNS in the meantime\" (fishandchp, 17 Mar 2021 09:17 in CLP.L) \"We could be some INCREDIBLE results soon. Just gotta be patient for now. I don't think it'll happen overnight. Would love to hear RKB's thoughts on timing.\" (fishandchp, 22 Mar 2021 22:15 in CLP.L) \"Excited on where we're heading (5p end of May)\" (fishandchp, 7 May 2021 07:54 in CLP.L) \"Wait till it's [BTC] on the up and the SP will rocket with it only common sense...\" (fishandchp, 21 May 2021 17:23) \"...hopefully we'll be closer to 4.5p by the end of the week.\" (fishandchp, 9 Nov 2021 09:29) \"QBT is in the right place at the right time. 2025 is the breakthrough year.\" (fishandchp, 18 Jan 2025 22:05) \"Very excited to see where this will take us in the week.\" (fishandchp, 20 Jan 2025 09:52) \"Consolidation for now prediction for 2.7p end of next month. Do think this is very conservative given the meetings arranged next week but a realistic timeline nevertheless.\" (fishandchp, 22 Jan 2025 13:06)",
