After the year end, we announced that we had purchased an option over 50% over a lithium exploration project in Western Australia.\n1. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES\n1.1 WELSH GOLD PROJECTS\nIntroduction\nThe story at Clogau and the wider Dolgellau Gold Belt this past year has been of our team having to manage a series of obstacles to the implementation of our work programmes. However, due in no small measure to our ability to overcome those many challenges that have been thrown at us, as I write I am more optimistic than ever about the prospects for the Clogau Mine.\nThe most obvious example of those obstacles came during the course of the dewatering of our primary in-mine gold target, the Llechfraith Target within the Lower Llechfraith Workings. Having spent the best part of two years undertaking a painstaking Habitat Regulations Assessment for the Mine, and finally obtaining the permits in July 2023 to enable us to commence the dewatering of those workings, we then encountered freak and sustained rainfall of historic proportions in north Wales during the summer of 2023 which meant that our permits had to be effectively re-applied for, to allow for much higher pumping rates. Nonetheless, we now have those enhanced permits and are busy getting on with preparations for blasting and bulk sampling.\nIn this section, I cover the progress made at the Llechfraith Target as well as over our regional exploration targets and at the historic gold Waste Tip.\nClogau and the Llechfraith Target (100% owned)\nDuring the first half of the reporting period, much of our work was focused on securing the ecological permits required for us to be able to dewater and then explore the Llechfraith Target within the Lower Llechfraith Workings at Clogau, this being our highest priority gold target within the Mine system. During the second half of the reporting period and in the post reporting period, we have been getting on with implementing our work programmes.\nThe Llechfraith Target at Clogau has all the key geological characteristics for the occurrence of high-grade gold mineralisation, including greenstone sills, Clogau Shales and structural complexity in the lode itself. This area was a key focus for the last large-scale development efforts at Clogau, prior to Alba's time.\nIn July 2023 we were delighted to report the award to us of the key ecological permits in relation to our plans to bulk sample the Llechfraith Target. Having already done much of the preparatory and planning work in advance in terms of lining up contractors, equipment and materials, we were able to start the dewatering exercise within a matter of days following permit grant. And once the workings had been dewatered to a sufficient extent, our contractors were able to start work on the essential safety and access works which would enable us to make our way safely into the lower workings.\nDewatering was initially successfully undertaken down to circa six metres depth, however unseasonal and exceptionally heavy rainfall during last summer, some three times higher than the average for the time of year, resulted in the workings reflooding. In September 2023, we were refused our request for a temporary extension to higher rate abstraction to take account of those exceptionally heavy rains in July and August. So, while we progressed our applications for formal variations to our discharge and abstraction permits, we at the same time commenced emergency abstraction under the statutory right afforded to us under the Water Resources Act 1991 to protect the integrity of the safety and access works we had completed on Levels 2 and 3 prior to the workings reflooding.\nThe formal permit variations were granted in December 2023, and enabled us to complete the dewatering of the Mine down to and including No.4 Level.\nOnce access was obtained to No.4 Level, our team took more than 40 samples from there and then processed those samples through the Company's Gravity Processing Plant to produce heavy mineral concentrates. Composites of the concentrates were then sent to a third-party refining facility and returned exceptional gold grades:\n-\nFrom Composite 1: 3.1 grams of gold were recovered from 49.2 kg of sample (dry weight), equating to a back-calculated head grade of 89.15 g/t or 2.87 troy ounces per tonne (oz/t).\n-\nFrom Composite sample 2: 3.2 grams of gold were recovered from 34.4 kg of sample (dry weight), equating to a back-calculated head grade of 111.63 g/t or 3.59 oz/t.\n-\nFrom Composite sample 3: 4.0 grams of gold were recovered from 36.9 kg of sample (dry weight), equating to a back-calculated head grade of 133.73 g/t or 4.30 oz/t.\nWhile the planned bulk sampling within the extension to the Llechfraith Payshoot below No.4 Level will target \"bonanza\" type grades of the kind found in previous periods of mining at Clogau, if the above grades encountered on No.4 Level are replicated more extensively, this is expected to significantly strengthen the economic case for reopening the mine for commercial production.\nA cabin structure on the Llechfraith Adit level is a key part of the bat exclusion and noise mitigation measures which were implemented by us to in order to secure the necessary environmental permits to enable us to proceed with bulk sampling works at the Lower Llechfraith Workings. Acoustics tests which we undertook in September 2023 demonstrated that these measures were sufficiently effective for us to be granted an extension to our permission (under a European Protected Species Licence) in November 2023 which entitles the Company to continue its operations to dewater and explore the Lower Llechfraith workings at Clogau continuously until 31 September 2024.\nDolgellau Gold Exploration Project (100% owned)\nIn relation to our airborne geophysical surveys over some of the key regional exploration targets over the Dolgellau Gold Belt, the start date was impacted by delays in getting the go-ahead from the Civil Aviation Authority and subsequently by adverse weather conditions across the survey areas. In the end, we obtained the final permission and completed the surveys in February 2024.\nAs at the date of writing, we have announced the results of the interpretation of the geophysical data collected over the Clogau mine area, which has identified three new gold targets. Two of those are within the envelope of the existing mine area, which is an advantage as it should be feasible to access and drill those targets directly from underground. We await the results of interpretation of the data sets covering the other two regional target areas covered of Hafod Owen and Castell Carndochan.\nClogau Waste Tip (100% owned)\nMeanwhile, over at the historic Waste Tip, where average grades from Alba's sampling of the fine fraction (ollowing a review of the plan for future exploitation of the Waste Tip the Company has decided to carry out a trenching programme prior to submitting a planning application for the Waste Tip. As at the date of writing, the trenching programme has collected around 35 tonnes of fines material and we are now proceeding to process that material for its gold content.\n1.2\nGREENROC MINING PLC\nIntroduction\nFrom September 2021, when Alba completed the spin-out and IPO of our Greenland assets into GreenRoc Mining Plc (\"GreenRoc\"), until March 2023, Alba held a 54% majority interest in GreenRoc. As such, Alba's consolidated financial statements include GreenRoc and its subsidiaries to that date.\nMore recently, fundraisings completed by GreenRoc in order to push forward the development of the high-grade Amitsoq project in southern Greenland have resulted in the dilution of Alba's stake in GreenRoc to 38.17 % as at the reporting date and to 37.49% at today's date. Nonetheless, we remain by some distance GreenRoc's largest shareholder and remain heavily involved in the strategic direction and development of the company.\nIn fact, we did participate in GreenRoc's fundraising during the year, contributing \u00a3115,000 in the company's August 2023 share placing. We have always made it clear that we would look to support GreenRoc's fundraising efforts as and when it is feasible to do that. Since its IPO, GreenRoc has consistently delivered excellent results and made great strides at what is turning into a world-class graphite project at Amitsoq.\nDevelopments during the reporting period\nGreenRoc made significant progress at the Amitsoq Project during the year. The highlights have included:\n-\nIn January 2023, a three times increase was declared in the Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") for the Amitsoq Island Graphite Project, which now totals 23.05 Mt at a grade of 20.41% C(g) for 4.71 Mt contained graphite.\n-\nIn February 2023, the European Raw Materials Alliance declared its official support for the Amitsoq Project, calling it a deposit of \"global importance\".\n-\nIn March 2023, GreenRoc was named \"Greenland's Prospector and Developer of the Year\" at PDAC Toronto.\n-\nIn September 2023, GreenRoc commenced a Feasibility Study on establishing an active anode material (AAM) processing plant in Northern Europe, partly funded by a \u00a3250k grant from the UK's Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF).\n-\nIn October 2023, GreenRoc published an independent Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for Amitsoq, which validated the Project's potential to become a globally significant producer of graphite concentrate. The PEA's highlights included:\n- An after-tax NPV8 of US$179M, an IRR of 26.7% and 22-year a life of mine (''LOM'');\n- Total gross revenue of US$2.1Bn over the LOM, with average net revenue of US$89.8M per year; and\n- A 4-year payback period on capital from the start of production.\nPost year end highlights included the following:\n-\nJanuary 2024: GreenRoc published successful electrochemical battery test results on AAM produced from Amitsoq graphite.\n-\nFebruary 2024: GreenRoc announced that the exploitation licence process for Amitsoq is expected to accelerate after recent changes in Greenland mining laws, resulting in the Amitsoq exploitation licence application being expected to be filed in H1 2024 with a possible grant of licence by the end of 2024.\n-\nMarch 2024: GreenRoc participated in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) roundtable at PDAC Toronto, hosted by the South Korean Government.\n-\nMay 2024: GreenRoc announced the compelling results of a Preliminary Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") in respect of the establishment of a downstream processing plant to produce active anode material from graphite concentrate produced from GreenRoc's planned graphite mine at Amitsoq, South Greenland. The after-tax NPV8 for the anode plant operation was calculated at US$545M with an IRR of 25.3%, total gross revenue of US$6.5Bn over a 22-year operating period, total gross profit totalling US$2.7Bn and a 4-year payback period on capital from the start of production.\nThese PFS results firmly place GreenRoc as one of the few realistic contenders to supply the European electric vehicle battery industry with domestically produced active anode material, and reinforce the company's plans for a vertically integrated production model for Amitsoq, from mine to battery anode material production.\nWith all of this progress delivered and more to come, at Alba we believe that Amitsoq is well set to continue its upward trajectory towards development and production.\n1.3 OTHER PROJECTS AND INVESTMENTS\nDuring the period, we surrendered the licence for our Limerick Base Metals Project. The targets we had identified for exploration drilling at Limerick could not be progressed as planned due to landowner access issues, and alternative drill collar locations proved not to be financially viable. As such, we were obliged to surrender the licence.\nIn March 2023, the majority licence holder of the Horse Hill Oil Field in Surrey, England, UKOG Plc, announced the terms of a proposed farmout arrangement to a third-party group which would fund a seismic survey at Horse Hill. The farmout is subject to approval by the shareholders of the operator of the field, Horse Hill Developments Limited (\"HHDL\"), including Alba. UKOG announced in December 2023 the extension of those terms to 30 June 2024. As at the date of this report, the shareholders have not approved the farmout.\nAfter the reporting date, HHDL made a partial repayment of shareholder loans, Alba receiving \u00a3102,000.\nIn April 2024, we announced that we had acquired an option to purchase a 50% interest in the Andover West Lithium Project, a highly prospective lithium exploration project in the West Pilbara, Western Australia (encompassing the lithium rights in mineral exploration licence E47-3373 and exploration licence application ELA47-4844). Favourable geology within the Project area is indicative of its lithium potential. A significant amount of lithium exploration activity has taken place in neighbouring tenements in recent years, including the discovery at the Andover Project immediately to the east of numerous thick, high-grade lithium intersections (e.g. 209.4m @ 1.42% Li\u2082O). Western Australia already hosts four of the world's biggest lithium mines, with combined reserves exceeding 500 Mt.\nAt the time of writing, we are in the process of carrying out confirmatory due diligence during our 30-day option period. If we elect to exercise the option for a 50% interest in the Andover West Project, we will pay GBP 250,000 in Alba shares at a premium of 25% above the VWAP of Alba ordinary shares in the 15 trading days prior to the exercise of the option plus 1 for 1 attaching 12 month share warrants at an exercise price of 0.2p per share.\n2. CORPORATE\n2.1 Funding\nIn July 2023, Alba announced a share placing, raising \u00a3750,000 before costs. A broker option was included as part of the placing, allowing shareholders and others to apply through their brokers for an allocation in the placing, and later in July it was announced that an additional \u00a315,150 had been raised via the broker option.\nAfter the reporting period, in March 2024, Alba announced a share placing, raising \u00a3380,000 in gross proceeds.\n2.2 Investments\nIn March 2023, following the dilution of its shareholding in GreenRoc due to a share placing by the latter, the Group ceased to consolidate the GreenRoc companies and instead accounted for its holding in GreenRoc as an \"Investment in Associate\".\nUnder applicable accounting standards, the dilution and resulting change in GreenRoc's status from subsidiary to associate is a deemed disposal of GreenRoc by Alba which results in an accounting loss on the parent company balance sheet, as the investment value is remeasured at the date of disposal. At Group level, a profit on deemed disposal arises as previously eliminated fair value uplift from the initial IPO transaction is now partially recognised. This accounting gain does not have any tax implications for the Group.\nIn August 2023 Alba participated in a GreenRoc placing, subscribing for 3,026,316 Placing Shares for a total subscription of \u00a3115,000.\nAlba's current holding in GreenRoc is 37.49% of the issued share capital of that company.\n2.3 Other\nShortly after the reporting date, Alba announced new grants of options and warrants to management and directors at the same time as cancelling a number of warrants and options with similar terms and exercise prices. This exercise was undertaken to reflect changes in role, align incentives and ensure the options qualify for tax-approved status where possible.\nDuring the reporting period, the Company announced a change in broker from OvalX to CMC Capital Markets.\nFor a detailed financial review, see the Strategic Report which follows this statement.\n3. OUTLOOK\nThe outlook for our Welsh gold projects is strong, not least as we now find ourselves within touching distance of possible first gold production from the bulk sampling of both the Waste Tip and the Llechfraith Target.\nWith that in mind, in the next period we intend to further our partnership, marketing and offtake discussions in relation to future gold produced at Clogau and at the same time to continue our development work to establish a fully traceable \"mine-to-market\" supply chain. This will underpin our ability to command a premium price for our gold production.\nThe coming six months also promises to be very productive at GreenRoc. The publication of the much-anticipated PFS for the establishment of an anode processing plant using Amitsoq graphite as the feedstock promises to add significant value to a world-class project which already benefits from a strong economic assessment of the upstream operations.\nAt the same time as developing our existing assets and supporting our investee companies, we remain focused on securing one or more additional complementary assets for Alba which will help drive serious value and growth for shareholders into the future. Our first foray into a new project was announced in April 2024, with the option we have taken over the Andover West Lithium Project in Western Australia. As we are already heavily invested in the battery materials sector with our major stake in the Amitsoq Graphite Project, we see exposure to lithium, one of the other critical raw materials in an Electric Vehicle battery, as highly complementary to our existing portfolio.\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Board and our management & technical team for their continued hard work and dedication over the course of the year and to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support. I look forward to all of us at Alba continuing our work in the year ahead to deliver on our overriding objective of generating significant value for our shareholders.\nGeorge Frangeskides\nExecutive Chairman\n7 May 2024\nEXTRACT FROM THE STRATEGIC REPORT\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe Group made a loss of \u00a3196,000 after tax (2022: loss of \u00a32,605,000), including an accounting gain in relation to the de-consolidation of GreenRoc of \u00a31,475,000 and a share of loss of GreenRoc as an associate of \u00a3661,000 (although unaudited at today's date, management is satisfied that this value is not expected to change).\nOperating losses were \u00a3683,000 compared with \u00a32,607,000 in the comparative period. The reduction in costs is principally due to ceasing to consolidate GreenRoc Mining plc from 9 March 2023, where a full year of results from GreenRoc was included in the prior year. The underlying operating losses of Alba and its remaining subsidiaries are at a similar level year-on-year.\nDuring the period, \u00a3508,000 was spent on exploration activities across the Group. Cash at the period end was \u00a397,000. As noted above, Alba raised funding of \u00a3750,000 via a placing during the reporting period and \u00a3380,000 since the reporting date.\nIntangible assets decreased by \u00a34.9m from the prior year as at the year end. GreenRoc's intangible assets were not included in the balance. Instead, the Group's investment in GreenRoc is shown in a new line, \"Investment in Associate\", of \u00a33.5m, representing the Group's investment in GreenRoc at a remeasured value at the date of deconsolidation, less any further dilution and a proportionate share of losses since deconsolidation.\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 NOVEMBER 2023\nNote\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nOther income\n55\n-\nAdministrative expenses\n5\n(738)\n(1,623)\nImpairment expense\n-\n(984)\nOperating loss\n(683)\n(2,607)\nGain on deemed disposal of subsidiary\n3\n1,475\n-\nLoss on dilution of investment in associate\n3\n(325)\n-\nShare of loss of associate\n11\n(661)\n-\nRevaluation of financial liability\n-\n2\nFinance costs\n(2)\n-\nProfit/(loss) for the year before tax\n(196)\n(2,605)\nTaxation\n7\n-\n-\nProft/(loss) for the year\n(196)\n(2,605)\nAttributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(116)\n(2,039)\nNon-controlling interests\n(80)\n(566)\n(196)\n(2,605)\nEarnings per ordinary share\nBasic and diluted (pence)\n8\n(0.002)\n(0.031)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 NOVEMBER 2023\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfit/(loss) after tax\n(196)\n(2,605)\nItems that may subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss:\n-\nForeign exchange movements\n(1)\n-\nTotal comprehensive income\n(197)\n(2,605)\nTotal comprehensive income attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(117)\n(2,039)\nNon-controlling interests\n(80)\n(566)\n(197)\n(2,605)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n30 NOVEMBER 2023\nNote\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment\n9\n168\n150\nIntangible fixed assets\n10\n3,520\n8,450\nInvestment in associate -

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION\nAlba Mineral Resources plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales, whose shares are publicly traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The registered office address is 6th Floor 60 Gracechurch Street, London, United Kingdom, EC3V 0HR. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented.\na.\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alba Mineral Resources plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (\"IFRSs\") as they apply to the Group for the year ended 30 November 2023 and with the Companies Act 2006. Numbers have been rounded to \u00a3'000.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, save for the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.\nNew or amended Standards and interpretations that became effective during the year ended 30 November 2023 had no impact on the Group accounts.\nNew standards, amendments, and interpretations not yet effective\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 November 2023 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group and Company. These standards include:\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (effective 1 Jan 2024) - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 Jan 2024) - Lease liability in a sale and leaseback\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 - Supplier finance (effective 1 Jan 2024)\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 21 - Lack of Exchangeability\nThe Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards or amendments will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company and the Group in the period of initial application or in future reporting periods. Other amendments, standards and interpretations are in issue, both endorsed and not yet endorsed, but they are not relevant to the Group and Company and as such they are not commented on.\nb.\nGoing concern\nBased on financial projections prepared by the Directors, the Group's current cash resources are insufficient to enable the Group to meet its recurring outgoings and projected exploration expenditure for the entirety of the next twelve months. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts to 12 months from the date of signing of these accounts which take into account planned exploration spend, costs and external funding. The need for external funding is a material uncertainty that may cast doubt on the Group's and Company's ability to continue as a going concern. At this stage as an explorer the Group does not have a steady income stream and is reliant on external funding sources such as capital raisings or asset transactions to fund activities. The nature of these is ad-hoc and as such the Group and Company do not carry a cash balance sufficient for 12 months of expenditure. However, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will continue to be able to meet their commitments for the foreseeable future by raising funds when required from the equity capital markets and based on the following:\n\u00b7\nThe Group has a strong track record in sourcing external funding.\n\u00b7\nForecasts contain a level of discretionary spend such that in the event that cash flow becomes constrained action can be taken to enable the Group to operate within available funding. The Group demonstrated this during the Covid-19 pandemic when sourcing capital was uncertain.\n\u00b7\nThe Group and Company may also consider future joint venture funding arrangements in order to share the costs of the development of its exploration assets, or to consider divesting of certain of its assets and realising cash proceeds in that way in order to support the balance of its exploration and investment portfolio.\nFor these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nc.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and companies controlled by the Company, the Subsidiary Companies, drawn up to 30 November each year.\nControl is recognised where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, where appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein.\nChanges in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity within the dilution of ownership reserve.\nNon-controlling interests consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.\nd.\nForeign currency\nFor the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group entity are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising are included in profit or loss for the period.\nFor the purposes of preparing consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses from exchange differences so arising are shown through the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.\ne.\nShare based payments\nShare-based compensation benefits are made on an ad-hoc basis on the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee or via the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme where the employee meets the qualifying conditions. The fair value of warrants or options granted is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in the warrant reserve. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:\no\nincluding any market performance conditions (e.g. the entity's share price)\no\nexcluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (e.g. profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period), and\no\nincluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions (e.g. the requirement for employees to save or hold shares for a specific period of time).\nThe total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to the warrant reserve.\nf.\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets: Deferred exploration and evaluation costs\nPre-licence costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Expenditure on licence renewals and new licence applications covering an area previously under licence are capitalised in accordance with the policy set out below.\nOnce the legal right to explore has been acquired, exploration costs and evaluation costs arising are capitalised on a project-by-project basis, pending determination of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project. Costs include appropriate technical and administrative expenses. If a project is successful, the related expenditures will be reclassified as development and production assets and amortised over the estimated life of the commercial reserves. Prior to this, no amortisation is recognised in respect of such costs. When all licences comprising a project are relinquished, a project abandoned, or is considered to be of no further commercial value to the Company, the related costs will be written off to administrative expense within profit or loss. Deferred exploration costs are carried at historical cost less any impairment losses recognised.\nWhere the Group has entered into a farm out agreement, the Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. It also does not recognise any gain or loss on its exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements but redesignates any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest with any excess accounted for as a gain on disposal.\nWhere the Group enters into a farm in agreement, the Group recognises all expenditure which it incurs under that agreement, with the expenditure being either capitalised or expensed in accordance with the policy detailed above.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nLand is shown at cost and is not depreciated as it is not a wasting asset. The land owned by the Group is an integral part of access to one of the Group's projects and as such its value is reviewed annually as part of the impairment review of that project value as a whole.\nPlant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) over their expected useful lives as follows:\no\nPlant and vehicles - 10 years\no\nComputer equipment - 3 years\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the consolidated entity. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss. Any revaluation surplus reserve relating to the item disposed of is transferred directly to retained profits.\nInvestment in subsidiaries\n: Investment in subsidiaries, comprising equity instruments and capital contributions, are recognised initially at cost less any provision for impairment. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\nInvestment in associates:\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5.\nUnder the equity method, an investment in an associate is recognised initially in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost from the date on which the investee becomes an associate and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\nAdjustments are made to the carrying amount when changes in the proportionate interest in the associate arise.\nIf there is objective evidence that the Group's net investment in an associate is impaired, the requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Group's investment.\ng.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The classification is dependent on the business model adopted for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows expected to be derived from the assets.\nThe Group classifies its financial instruments as follows:\nFinancial assets\nTrade and other receivables\nAmortised cost\nLoans to subsidiaries (Company only)\nAmortised cost\nInvestments\nAt fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)\nFinancial liabilities\nTrade and other payables\nAmortised cost\nBorrowings\nAmortised cost\nOther borrowings\nAmortised cost\nTrade and other receivables:\nTrade and other receivables are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and are classified as being measured at amortised cost. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.\nLoans to subsidiaries (Company only):\nLong-term loans to subsidiaries, other than capital contributions, are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and are classified as being measured at amortised cost, net of provision for impairment. Impairment is initially based on the expected lifetime credit loss as applied to the portfolio of loans. The loans are interest free and have no fixed repayment terms. As such the loans are assessed as being credit impaired on inception and lifetime expected credit losses are recognised with the amount of provision being recognised in the profit or loss.\nA loan will be subject to impairment review if there is an indicator of impairment, such as the impairment of the value of the deferred exploration intangible asset within the relevant subsidiary. A loan is fully impaired when the relevant subsidiary recognises an impairment of its deferred exploration expenditure, such that the subsidiary is not expected to be able to repay the loan from its existing assets.\nInvestments (Company only):\nInvestments in unlisted equity instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are recognised initially at investment cost. Any shareholder loans made are included in the investment cost. Where a value can be reliably measured the investment is subsequently recognised at fair value through profit and loss. Information about the methods and assumptions used in determining fair value is provided in Note 12.\nTrade and other payables:\nTrade and other payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.\nBorrowings: I\nnitially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are then subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.\nLiability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below.\nOther borrowings:\nrecognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.\nLeases:\nThe Group does not have any leases within the scope of IFRS16.\nh.\nEquity\nShare capital\nrepresents the nominal value of equity shares, both ordinary and preference.\nShare premium\nrepresents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net\nof expenses of the share issue.\nWarrant reserve\nrepresents proceeds from the issue of extant warrants.\nDilution of ownership reserve\nrepresents the difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share of the fair value of net assets acquired in a dilutive transaction where control is retained.\nOther reserves\nrepresents the proceeds from the issue of warrants by GreenRoc Mining plc attributable to the equity holders of the group.\nForeign currency reserve\nholds gains/losses arising on retranslating the net assets of the Group into pounds sterling.\ni.\nTaxation\nThe charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account deferred tax\n.\nThe tax expense\nfor the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.\nManagement periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss and is accounted for using the liability method.\nDeferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available in the foreseeable future against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\nDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\nj.\nSegmental information\nAn operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments. In the Group's current portfolio, the geographical location of exploration projects provides the basis for grouping into segments.\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors of the Company.\n2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows:\ni) JUDGEMENTS\nCapitalisation of exploration and evaluation costs - \u00a33,520,000\nThe capitalisation of exploration costs relating to the exploration and evaluation phase requires management to make judgements as to the future events and circumstances of a project, especially in relation to whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. In making such judgements, the Directors take comfort from the findings from exploration activities undertaken, the fact the Group intends to continue these activities and that the Company expects to be able to raise additional funding to enable it to continue the exploration activities.\nImpairment assessment of exploration and evaluation costs - \u00a33,520,000\nAt each reporting date, management make a judgment as to whether circumstances have changed following the initial capitalisation and whether there are indicators of impairment. If there are such indicators, an impairment review will be performed which could result in the relevant capitalised amount being written off to the income statement. For further details see Note 10 \"Intangible Assets\".\nThis balance includes \u00a33.5m relating to the Clogau Gold Project. Management do not judge the Exploration and Evaluation costs associated with that project to be impaired at 30 November 2023. Exploration is underway, and planned and budgeted throughout the year, and the Company expects a new option agreement to be granted to it with effect from the expiry of the current option in February 2025.The Group has no data at this point that suggests that the asset value is unlikely to be recovered from successful development.\nAccounting for the investment in GreenRoc Mining plc\nDuring the year the Group's holding in GreenRoc was diluted to below 50%, with an expectation of further dilution within the same accounting period. At the date of this report the shareholding stands at 37.49%. Management judged that once the shareholding dropped below 50%, consolidation was no longer appropriate. Agreements had been put in place at the time of the IPO in 2021 to limit the ability of Alba to control GreenRoc, and that in combination with a reduced shareholding meant that the relationship was that of significant influence rather than control. The decision was taken to reclassify the investment in subsidiary as an investment in associate. In line with IAS 28 \"Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\" the investment in associate is held at remeasured cost less a share of profit or loss for the period.\nImpairment assessment of the investment in GreenRoc Mining plc - \u00a33,447,000\nAt the year end management made a judgement that the value of the investment in GreenRoc Mining plc was not impaired. The Group believes that the underlying value of the assets of that company, the Amitsoq graphite project and the Thule ilmenite project, supports the value of the investment. The investment is intended to be long-term until the projects are developed and the current pressure on GreenRoc's share price is a reflection of poor conditions in the sector /market. At the balance sheet date the market value of the Company's shareholding in GreenRoc was \u00a31,544,000.\nAccounting for investment in Horse Hill Developments Limited\nThe Group and Company's investment in Horse Hill Developments Limited (\"HHDL\") is in the form of equity and a shareholder loan. However, the Directors judge that the loan is in substance part of the equity investment as governed by the HHDL investment agreement. As such the loan element of the investment is accounted for at fair value with movements in fair value being taken to profit or loss (FVTPL).\nThe Group and Company's shareholding in HHDL is less than 20%. A director of the Company is also a director of HHDL but does not act in an executive capacity. At the balance sheet date HHDL had a majority shareholder with a 77.9% shareholding. The Directors judge that the Company does not have significant influence over HHDL and that it should not be equity accounted for as an associate.\nCompany only - Impairment assessment of investment in and loans to subsidiaries - \u00a31,455,000 and \u00a31,992,000\nIn preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors apply judgement to decide if any, or all of the company's investments in (and where applicable loans to) Aurum Mineral Resources Limited, Dragonfire Mining Limited group and GMOW Gwynfynydd Limited are impaired or not.\nThese companies have no source of funds other than their shareholders and the ability of the companies to repay their inter-company debt and for the Company to gain value from its investments in the companies is dependent on the future success of the companies' exploration activities. In undertaking their review, the Directors consider the outcome of their impairment assessment of the relevant licences as detailed above.\nThe Directors have used the Expected Credit Loss model to make a general provision against intercompany loans receivable based on historic credit losses and current data. In applying the expected credit loss model, the directors have judged that the loans to the subsidiaries were credit impaired on inception. See Note 13 for further details.\nii) ESTIMATES\nCarrying value of investment in Horse Hill Developments Limited - \u00a32,600,000\nThe Company's investment in Horse Hill Developments Limited is carried at fair value, as, in the judgement of the Directors, it has been possible to estimate a reliable fair value for the investment. For further details of the valuation see Note 12.\nThe Directors believe that the intrinsic value of the oil field has not been diminished during the year and this is mirrored by the majority owner maintaining the asset valuation in their balance sheet from 30 September 2022 to 30 September 2023. As the majority owner has access to more information for valuation purposes than the Group, management relies on their published information to support the Group's assumptions.\nRemeasurement of retained investment in GreenRoc Mining plc after deemed disposal - \u00a34,318,000\nUpon loss of control, GreenRoc was de-consolidated from Alba group via a deemed disposal. In accordance with IFRS 10, management remeasured the value of its retained investment to be taken as the cost of investment on initial recognition as an investment in associate. The value was calculated as the applicable percentage of GreenRoc's net assets immediately after de-consolidation.\n3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS\nDeemed disposal of subsidiary\nDuring the year the Group's holding in GreenRoc was diluted to below 50%, with an expectation of further dilution within the same accounting period. Management judged that once the shareholding dropped below 50%, control had been lost and consolidation was no longer appropriate.\nThis was accounted for as a deemed disposal.\nThe 44.67% retained interest in GreenRoc was then accounted for as an investment in associate at a remeasured value.\nSee the notes on management judgements above.\nIn the Company financial statements, the disposal was accounted for as follows:\n\u00a3'000\nBook value of investment disposed of\n(5,500)\nRetained interest remeasured and transferred to investment in associate\n4,318\nLoss on deemed disposal\n(1,182)\nIn the Group financial statements the fair value uplift arising in GreenRoc on the IPO was eliminated on consolidation as an intercompany balance. That elimination does not take place with an investment in associate. As the remeasured retained interest includes a share of fair value uplift, a gain on deemed disposal arises.\n\u00a3'000\nNet assets deemed disposed of (intangible assets, cash and net current assets)\n(5,031)\nNon-controlling interest eliminated on disposal\n2,486\nInvestment eliminated on disposal\n(298)\nRetained interest remeasured and recognised as an investment in associate\n4,318\nGain on deemed disposal\n1,475\nPartial disposals of investment in associate by dilution\nDuring the year placings by an investee company led to dilutions of the Group's holding in that company. These were accounted for as partial deemed disposals for nil consideration, as they reduced the share of net assets held by the Group and therefore losses arose. For more information see Note 11 Investment in Associate.\n4. ANALYSIS OF SEGMENTAL INFORMATION\nThe Group currently only has one primary reporting business segment, exploration and development. The Board of the Company evaluates the business on a sector basis, the two sectors being mining and oil and gas.

Using a weighted average rate would not change the effective tax rate.\na) Analysis of charge in the period\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax at 19% (2022: 19%)\n-\n-\nDeferred taxation\n-\n-\nb) Factors affecting tax charge for the period\nThe tax assessed on the loss for the year before tax differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK which is 19% (2022: 19%). The differences are explained below:\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfit/(loss) before tax\n(196)\n(2,605)\nProfit/(loss) multiplied by standard rate of tax\n(37)\n(495)\nEffects of:\nExpenses not deductible / losses not allowable\n197\n235\nDeferred tax assets not recognised/capital allowances not claimed\n(160)\n260\n-\n-\nA deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of timing differences relating to tax losses and accelerated capital allowances, due to uncertainty that the potential asset will be recovered. The aggregated losses in each of the Group companies being Alba Mineral Resources plc and its subsidiaries as listed in Note 13 amounted to \u00a39,105,000 before adjustments required by local tax rules and excluding losses on intra-group transactions (2022: \u00a38,501,000).\n8 EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe calculation of the basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the consolidated loss attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Exploration is planned and budgeted for in 2023 and the Group has no data at this point that suggests that the asset value is unlikely to be recovered from successful development.\nDuring the period Alba's investment in GreenRoc Mining plc was diluted and reclassified as an investment in associate (see Note 11). The deemed disposal above is the removal of GreenRoc's intangible assets and any related impairments from the Group balance sheet.\nAt the year end the amount of liabilities (being creditors and accruals) relating to the exploration and evaluation assets was \u00a339,000.\n11.

Review of the investment led to reclassification from a subsidiary to an investment in associate. This was accounted for by a deemed disposal and acquisition at remeasured cost. For more information on management's judgement on the matter see Note 2. For details of the deemed disposal see Note 3.\nAt 30 November 2023 the (unaudited) consolidated results of GreenRoc Mining plc showed a loss for the year of \u00a31,693,000 with net assets of \u00a39,027,000, comprising non-current assets of \u00a39,741,000 and net current assets of \u00a3290,000 offset by a deferred tax liability of \u00a31,004,000.\n12. INVESTMENTS\nInvestment in HHDL\nGroup and Company\n\u00a3'000\nAt 30 November 2021\n3,385\nRevaluation of investment\n(785)\nAt 30 November 2022 and 30 November 2023\n2,600\nThe above investment represents an investment in 18.1% (2022: 18.1%*) of the issued share capital of Horse Hill Developments Limited (\"HHDL\") and associated loans to that company accruing interest at variable rates linked to the Bank of England base rate. Those loans and interest are treated as part of the overall investment and as such are classified as fair value through the profit and loss. Any interest due is subsumed within the overall investment valuation (see Note 22).\nHHDL is a private company with no stock quote. There have been no share transactions in HHDL stock nor transactions in licence interests in the past several years to provide any basis for valuation.\nThe majority owner and operator of HHDL, UK Oil & Gas plc (UKOG) recently announced its results for year ended 30 September 2023 maintaining its carrying values for the assets relating to the Horse Hill oil field and the HH1 well, based on net present value calculated utilizing an internally generated depletion curve that was independently reviewed. Costs were based on current costs less any anticipated savings. A long-term average Brent oil price of US$78/bbl was used being the Brent curve until 2031 and then kept flat at $75/bbl. A discount rate of 2.79% was based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model analysis being the weighted average costs of capital of Horse Hill Developments, the holding company of the producing well HH-1. There is inherent uncertainty in any oil field valuation due to the uncertainty of future oil price movements.\nManagement relies on the valuations of the majority owner of the project as they have access to fuller information and therefore have maintained the current valuation of the investment in HHDL, in line with UKOG.\nThis revised valuation is a Level 3 valuation under the IFRS 9 hierarchy, as was the valuation in the prior year, as defined in Note 22.\nThe registered office of HHDL is: The Broadgate Tower, 8th Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, EC2A 2EW.\n*In a prior period the Company elected not to contribute its share of a cash call. As a result the Company's shareholding could be diluted but the impact would be minimal, the reduction being less than 0.1% of the total issued share capital of HHDL.\n13.\nINVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS\nInvestments\nCapital Contributions\nLoans\nTotal\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCompany\nAt 30 November 2021\n5,500\n1,116\n1,195\n7,811\nAdditions - purchase of minority and royalty\n-\n339\n-\n339\nAdditions - expenditure\n-\n-\n370\n370\nImpairment of intercompany loan\n-\n-\n(15)\n(15)\nAt 30 November 2022\n5,500\n1,455\n1,550\n8,505\nAdditions - expenditure\n-\n-\n440\n440\nDeemed disposal by dilution\n3\n(5,500)\n-\n-\n(5,500)\nAt 30 November 2023\n-\n1,455\n1,990\n3,445\nThe Company recognises a provision for expected credit loss against the loans due from subsidiaries. These loans are interest-free and have no agreed terms. For the purposes of IFRS 9 the loans were assumed to be repayable on demand. However, management has agreed that these loans will not be recalled within 12 months from the balance sheet date so they are classified as long term.\nThe loans are assessed as being credit impaired on inception as the subsidiaries have no income other than the receipt of inter-company funding and as the loans are primarily used to fund the subsidiaries deferred exploration expenditure. The subsidiaries would only be able to repay the loans if they can either sell their exploration assets or develop them to the point at which the assets generate cash flows, both of which would take time to achieve. Therefore, at inception, it is known that the loans will not be able to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms (that is, on demand) and therefore they are assessed as being credit impaired.\nHistoric and current data has been used to derive a probability of default and this has been applied across the portfolio of loans.\nAt 30 November 2023 the Company held the following interests in subsidiary undertakings, which are included in the consolidated financial statements:\nName of company\nCountry of incorporation\nHolding at 30 November 2023\nNature of holding\nHolding at 30 November 2022\nBusiness\nAurum Mineral Resources Ltd\nIreland\n100%\nDirect\n100%\nExploration\nMauritania Ventures Limited\nEngland & Wales\nDissolved Feb '23\nDirect\n50%\nNon-trading\nDragonfire Mining Limited\nEngland & Wales\n100%\nDirect\n100%\nExploration\nGold Mines of Wales Limited\nJersey\n100%\nIndirect\n100%\nHolding Co.\nGMOW (Holdings) Limited\nEngland & Wales\n100%\nIndirect\n100%\nHolding Co.\nGMOW (Operations) Limited\nEngland & Wales\n100%\nIndirect\n100%\nExploration\nGMOW Gwynfynydd Limited\nEngland & Wales\n100%\nDirect\n100%\nExploration\nThe address of the registered office of Aurum Mineral Resources Ltd is c/o Hugh Lennon Associates, Unit 8&10 Church View, Cavan, Ireland.\nThe address of the registered office of Gold Mines of Wales Limited is 3rd Floor, IFC5, Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey JE2 3BY.\nAll the other companies have their registered office at 6th Floor, 60 Gracechurch Street, London EC3V 0HR.\nMauritania Ventures Limited has been treated as a subsidiary undertaking because the Company exercises dominant influence over the investment by virtue of having the casting vote at Board meetings. The Company was dissolved on 14 February 2023.\nDuring the period the holding in GreenRoc Mining plc was diluted leading to de-consolidation such that it is no longer a subsidiary of the Group and has been accounted for as an investment in associate.\nAfter the reporting date, GreenRoc Mining plc issued further share capital. Alba's interest in GreenRoc was diluted to 37.49% at 1 December 2023.\n14.

Thereafter the Group's investment in GreenRoc was recognised as an investment in associate. For further details see Note 3 and Note 11.\nAt prior year end the Group recognised the non-controlling interest in GreenRoc at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the entity's net identifiable assets as included in the Group balance sheet. These differed from the assets presented in the standalone GreenRoc Mining plc Report and Accounts due to consolidation entries, including elimination of fair valuation uplift generated in the IPO in 2021, judged by management to be intragroup profit.\nThe Report and Accounts of GreenRoc Mining plc can be found on its website www.greenrocmining.com.\n20. LEASES\nThe Company has no lease or rental commitments within scope of IFRS 16. Expenditure on short-term leases during the year was \u00a325,000 (2022: \u00a319,000).\n21. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS\nAt year end the Group had no capital commitments.\n22. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nA 1% net smelter royalty agreement remains in place with the previous owner of the Clogau gold project. The Group has no obligations under this agreement until such time as gold is produced and sold.\n23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Group's financial instruments comprise investments, cash at bank and various items such as debtors, loans and creditors. The Group has not entered into derivative transactions nor does it trade financial instruments as a matter of policy.\nCredit risk\nThe Group's credit risk arises primarily from cash at bank, debtors and the risk the counterparty fails to discharge its obligations. As at 30 November 2023, debtors included \u00a325,000 that was past due but not impaired (2022: \u00a325,000). Given the low number and value of debtors, management considers recoverability of any overdue amount individually on an annual basis.\nThe Company's credit risk primarily arises from intercompany debtors and this is reviewed annually in the course of reviewing the Expected Credit Loss provision required under IFRS 9. See Note 13 for more details.\nFunding risk\nFunding risk is the\u00a0possibility that the Group might not have access\u00a0to the\u00a0financing it needs. The Group's continued future operations depend on the ability to raise sufficient working capital through the issue of equity share capital. The Directors are confident that adequate funding will be forthcoming with which to finance operations. The Board has a strong track record of raising funds as required. Controls over expenditure are carefully managed and activities planned to ensure that the Group has sufficient funding.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk arises from the management of cash funds and working capital. The risk is that the Group will fail to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group operates within the constraints of available funds and cash flow projections are produced and regularly reviewed by management.\nAt 30 November 2022 the management considers that the liquidity risk is not material as sufficient cash is held to meet financial liabilities to be settled in cash.\nFuture liquidity risk is addressed in Note 1 under the heading \"Going Concern\".\nInterest rate risk profile of financial assets\nExcluding the investment in HHDL, the only financial assets (other than short term debtors) are cash at bank and in hand, which comprises money at call. The interest earned in the year was nil. The Directors believe the fair value of the financial instruments is not materially different to the book value.\nThe investment in HHDL includes a loan element. Under an investment agreement those loans attract interest. Loans plus interest become payable once HHDL has surplus cash. As the Group / Company treats the loan as held at fair value through profit and loss, any interest credit is subsumed within the fair value movement.\nForeign currency risk\nThe Group has an Irish subsidiary, which can affect the Group's sterling denominated reported results as a consequence of movements in the sterling/euro exchange rates. The Group also incurs costs denominated in foreign currencies (primarily\nDanish Krone) which gives rise to short term exchange risk. The Group does not currently hedge against these exposures as they are deemed immaterial and there is no material exposure as at the year-end. No sensitivity analysis has been performed.\nMarket risk\nFollowing the acquisition of the investment in Horse Hill Developments Limited (\"HHDL\"), the Group is exposed to market risk in that the value of the investment would be expected to vary depending on the price of oil and the future cash calls will, to an extent, depend on the revenue generated from oil produced from well testing activities. For a review of the progress of the Horse Hill project, please see the Chairman's Statement.\nDuring the year under review the\nprice of\nBrent crude oil was stable at an average of $83, with a low spike of $72. However, a sustained downturn in the price of oil would have a materially adverse effect on the revenues generated from the Horse Hill Oil Field. A material reduction in the market value of\nHHDL shares\ncan be expected to\nresult in\na proportionate reduction\nin\nthe carrying\nvalue of the Group's investment in HHDL\n.\nCategories of financial\ninstrument\nGroup\nGroup\nCompany\nCompany\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nFinancial assets\nInvestments at fair value through profit or loss:\nInvestment in HHDL (Note 12)\n2,600\n2,600\n2,600\n2,600\nHeld at amortised cost:\nTrade and other receivables\n68\n109\n47\n92\nCash and cash equivalents\n97\n456\n84\n322\nIntercompany receivables net of expected credit losses\n-\n-\n1,992\n1,550\n2,765\n3,165\n4,723\n4,564\nFinancial liabilities\nHeld at amortised cost:\nTrade and other payables\n107\n237\n106\n96\nOther financial liabilities\n-\n-\n-\n-\n107\n237\n106\n96\nValuation of financial instruments\nUnder IFRS 9 the valuation of financial instruments is categorised based on the inputs used to generate the valuation as follows:\nLevel 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and equity securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as\npossible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities.\nThe Group's financial instruments by valuation method:\nLevel 3\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nFinancial assets held at FVTPL\nInvestment - FV at 30 November 2022\n2,600\n2,600\nImpairment expense in 2023\n-\n-\nInvestment - FV at 30 November 2023\n2,600\n2,600\nFinancial liabilities held at FVTPL\n-\n-\nFor more information on the valuation bases see the relevant Notes referred to above.\nIncluded in the value for HHDL are loans of \u00a32,126,000 plus accrued interest. These were designated as fair value through the profit and loss on recognition as they form part of the Company's investment in Horse Hill Developments Limited. The maximum exposure to credit risk of this financial asset at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amounts of the loans. The loans are not valued separately from the investment. No change in fair value to date has been attributable to a change in credit risk.\n24. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe Group's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and develop its mining and exploration activities to provide returns for shareholders. The Group's funding comprises equity and debt. The Directors consider the Company's capital and reserves to be capital. When considering the future capital requirements of the Group and the potential to fund specific project development via debt, the Directors consider the risk characteristics of all the underlying assets in assessing the optimal capital structure.\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAll related party transactions have been conducted at arm's length.\nFees charged by Directors are detailed below and also shown in Note 6. \"Directors' emoluments and staff costs\".\nCompany\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation. The loan balances and transactions in the year with the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 13. Details of transactions between the Company and other related parties are disclosed below.\nGroup\nDuring the year a subsidiary, GreenRoc Mining plc, was deconsolidated due to loss of control. After deconsolidation it was accounted for as an associate. Transactions with GreenRoc from this point were as follows:\nAlba charged GreenRoc \u00a375,000 for services from its personnel on an arm's length basis as per the Relationship agreement signed on IPO in September 2021 plus certain costs or a share of certain costs incurred on their behalf.\nFor his role of Chairman, GreenRoc paid George Frangeskides (Executive Chairman of Alba) a salary of \u00a354,000 for the year. \u00a313,500 of that is included within these accounts as it was paid prior to deconsolidation.\nStirling Corporate Limited and Berwick Capital Limited, companies which George Frangeskides, a director of the Company, controls, were paid combined \u00a32,000 during the year for recharges accrued in 2022 for historic costs incurred in the course of work performed on behalf of the Group.

Having employed the industry's standard techniques and premium instrumentation where possible, we are confident of the robustness of the Feasibility Study. This view is corroborated by the inclusion of a 25% contingency which forms part of the modelled capital cost of US$321M.\n\"This Feasibility Study firmly places GreenRoc as one of the few contenders to supply the European EV Battery industry with domestically produced active anode material. On behalf of GreenRoc, I would like to extend our gratitude towards Innovate UK for the generous support of a \u00a3250k grant towards this Feasibility Study though its Automotive Transformation Fund.\n\"There are further possible improvements to the process design which we will be looking into in a second stage, commencing shortly, and we will provide updates on that in due course.\n\"With the already positive Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Amitsoq graphite mine and now this compelling assessment of the economics of establishing a downstream anode processing plant for our graphite, our confidence in our plans for a vertically integrated production model for Amitsoq, from mine to battery anode material production, has been greatly reinforced.\"\nDetails\nThe Feasibility Study was project managed by the Company\nand\nconducted by SLR Consulting Ltd with\ncontributions from three expert consultants, namely Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, ProGraphite and Decision Risk Analytics.\nA key component of Li-based batteries is the active anode material (\"AAM\") which is composed of graphite in the form of coated spherical purified graphite (\"CSPG\"). Presently, China has a near monopoly, delivering more than 90% of the world's production of CSPG. With the energy transition seeing a gradual replacement of the world's internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles and a growing demand from Stationary Battery Storage Systems for solar energy farms and other uses, a 400% growth in demand for battery grade graphite is forecast by leading market analysts. There is therefore a political desire to urgently initiate production of domestically sourced and processed graphite for the European and North American battery industries.\nThe raw material for production of CSPG is natural flake graphite concentrate. The production of CSPG consists of a series of intermediate steps: first, the graphite concentrate is micronised to a standard particle size using a rotary impact mill. Then the graphite flake particles are introduced to a rounding impact mill or shaping mill, which turns the angular graphite flakes into rounded particles (speronized graphite). Purification then takes place via chemical leaching. In the Feasibility Study, this involved initially assessing a two-stage leaching process using a mix of hydrofluoric, hydrochloric and nitric acids to arrive at the required >99.95% purity. Finally, the spherical purified graphite (SPG) is coated with pitch and heated in kilns for about 24 hours before using high-intensity magnet separation for the removal of any impurities introduced during machining. The end-product CSPG is then sold to the battery industry to serve as AAM in lithium-ion batteries.\nFor the Feasibility Study, SLR has used proven state-of-the-art technology based on the use of equipment produced by Chinese manufacturers, including microniser impact mills, impact rounding mills, cyclones and air classifiers and filters, fitted with German electronic steering systems.\nThe processing plant will consist of 16 parallel micronisation/spheronisation lines each equipped with five microniser mills and 13 spheroniser mills.\nThe micronisation and spheronisation circuit is designed to provide a graphite product with high tap density (close to 1.0 g/cm3) and the ability to produce a range of characteristic particle sizes of d50 of 10 \u00b5m to 20 \u00b5m depending on specific settings and requirements from the battery industry.\nPurification will take place in four parallel leaching lines with a final stage of coating taking place in eight parallel lines with subsequent baking in kilns and final magnetic removal of any metal particles introduced during the processing.\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") model provided as part of the Feasibility Study shows a Pre-Tax\nNet Present Value at 8% discount rate (NPV8) of US$837M with an Internal Rate of Return (\"IRR\") of 33.8%, while the After-Tax NPV8 is US$545M with an IRR of 25.3%. The corporate tax is set at 22%, which is an average number for northern European Countries.\nThese NPV calculations are based on a 22-year production of 39,700t of CSPG per annum (from 80,000t of graphite concentrate at 95% graphitic carbon (C(g)), similar to the life of mine provisionally planned for the Amitsoq mine. However, as previously stated, the resource at Amitsoq could sustain a longer mine life (see the RNS of 23 January 2023). Based on 22 years of production, the total gross revenue for the anode plant has been calculated at US$6.5Bn over that period, with total gross profit totalling US$2.7Bn.\nThe initial capital cost is US$321M which includes a 25% contingency, while the operating cost is US$2,211 per tonne of produced CSPG. This results in a 4-year payback period on capital from the start of production.\nThe DCF model is based on a forecast price for CSPG of US$7,500 per tonne and with two types of bi-product (undersize graphite material) attracting a forecast price of US$300 per tonne.\nThe Feasibility Study has assumed that the anode plant operation will purchase the key input raw material, graphite concentrate, at a forecast market price of US$ 1,100 per tonne. This is in keeping with the approach of carrying out the Feasibility Study for the downstream anode plant as an entirely stand-alone economic assessment, separate to the economic assessment of the Amitsoq graphite mine and primary processing plant (in relation to which, refer to the results of the Preliminary Economic Assessment released by RNS on 31 October 2023). In practice, however, the cost to the anode plant operation of the graphite concentrate feedstock is expected to be determined by the cost of production of graphite concentrate from the Amitsoq mine rather than by market prices.\nOne of the largest cost elements in the economic model relates to power consumption (ca. 250 GWh per annum) for all of the various stages of processing and amounts to ca. US$318 per tonne of produced CSPG which is ca. 14% of the total operating cost of US$ 2,211 per tonne of CSPG. This makes the choice of a site very important in keeping operating costs down and reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, GreenRoc is reviewing several options for the location of the processing plant. The c\nost of labour is set at that for an average Northern European country.\nIn the near future, SLR will also look at an alternative purification technique using a combination of sodium hydroxide and acid mixtures other than hydrofluoric acid. Such sodium hydroxide-based purification is likely to be\nless expensive and have lower environmental impact and regulatory requirements than the standard hydrofluoric acid based technology. Early qualitative testwork conducted by ProGraphite on Amitsoq graphite suggests that the high purity requirement of 99.95% can be met using sodium hydroxide leaching (see the RNS of 20 January 2023). ProGraphite is currently undertaking a series of tests to constrain the use of chemicals for this purification technique, the results of which will be incorporated in an update to the Feasibility Study.\nAnother point of potential refinement is the costing for an onsite nitrogen gas production plant at the processing plant location. Nitrogen gas is used in the kilns where the final CSPG material is baked, hindering the oxidation (burning) of CSPG particles. In the current Feasibility Study, nitrogen gas is purchased in tanks and makes up a considerable portion of the consumables. Accordingly, a potential cost saving may be achieved by establishing local production of nitrogen gas.\nWith the completion of this Feasibility Study for the Anode Processing Plant, GreenRoc can now demonstrate that running a vertically integrated production of graphite anode material, based on graphite concentrate mined at the Company's planned Amitsoq mine, is a viable and potentially profitable undertaking. The next milestone with regard to the processing plant is identifying the site for the plant, and setting up a pilot scale processing plant to start the qualification process, which should lead to the signing of off-take agreements with the battery industry.\nExpected Final Results\nThe Company expects to report a consolidated loss of \u00a31,693,000 for the year to 30 November 2023 (2022: \u00a31,230,000), including an exceptional \u00a3787,000 impairment charge for the surrender of the Melville Bay project, which was announced by GreenRoc on 7 February 2024. The Company expects to report year-end consolidated net assets of approximately \u00a39,027,000 (2022: \u00a38,965,000), comprising non-current assets of \u00a39,741,000 and net current assets of \u00a3290,000 offset by a deferred tax liability of \u00a31,004,000. All of the aforementioned figures for the year to 30 November 2023 are unaudited.\nGreenroc expects to announce its final audited full year results for the year ended 30 November 2023 later this month.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market and business conditions, competition for qualified staff, the regulatory process and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting rights, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of regulatory and other third party consents and approvals, uncertainties regarding the Company's or any third party's ability to execute and implement future plans, and the occurrence of unexpected events.\nActual results achieved may vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.albamineralresources.com\nor contact:\nAlba Mineral Resources Plc\nGeorge Frangeskides, Executive Chairman +44 20 3950 0725\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nAndrew Emmott +44 20 3368 3555\nCMC Markets plc (Broker)\nThomas Smith\u00a0/ Douglas Crippen\n+44 20 3003 8632\nAlba's Projects and Investments\nAlba's Projects & Investments\nProjects Operated by Alba\nLocation\nOwnership\nClogau (gold)\nWales\n100%\nDolgellau Gold Exploration (gold)\nWales\n100%\nGwynfynydd (gold)\nWales\n100%\nInvestments Held by Alba\nLocation\nOwnership\nGreenRoc Mining Plc (mining)\nGreenland\n37.49%\nHorse Hill (oil)\nEngland\n11.765%\nOptions\nt\no Purchase Held by Alba\nOptioned Percentage\nA\nndover West\nLithium P\nroject\nAustralia\n5\n0%\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company reserves the right to reject any application for subscription under the Retail Offer without giving any reason for such rejection.\nIt is vital to note that once an application for Retail Offer Shares has been made and accepted via an intermediary, it is irrevocable and cannot be withdrawn.\nThe Retail Offer Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with existing ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after their date of issue.\nThe Retail Offer is an offer to subscribe for transferable securities, the terms of which ensure that the Company is exempt from the requirement to issue a prospectus under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 as amended (\"\nEUWA\n\"). While the target raise from the Retail Offer is \u00a3100,000, it is a term of the Retail Offer that the aggregate total consideration payable for the Retail Offer Shares will not exceed \u00a3200,000 (or the equivalent in Euros), allowing the Company the discretion to increase the total amount subscribed for up to the latter amount, subject to demand. The exemption from the requirement to publish a prospectus in section 86(1)(e) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended), will apply to the Retail Offer. As such, there is no need for publication of a prospectus pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation Rules of the FCA, or for approval of the same by the FCA.\nThe Retail Offer is not being made into any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom.\nNo offering document, prospectus or admission document has been or will be prepared or submitted to be approved by the FCA (or any other authority) in relation to the Retail Offer and investors' commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this announcement and information that has been published by or on behalf of the Company prior to this announcement by notification to a Regulatory Information Service in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, the AIM Rules for Companies and the Market Abuse Regulation (EU Regulation No. 596/2014) as it forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of EUWA.\nInvestors should make their own investigations into the merits of an investment in the Company. Nothing in this announcement amounts to a recommendation to invest in the Company or amounts to investment, taxation or legal advice.\nIt should be noted that a subscription for Retail Offer\nShares and investment in the Company carries a number of risks. Investors should take independent advice from a person experienced in advising on investment in securities such as the Retail Offer Shares if they are in any doubt.\nAn investment in the Company will place capital at risk. The value of investments, and any income, can go down as well as up, so investors could get back less than the amount invested.\nNeither past performance nor any forecasts should be considered a reliable indicator of future results.\nFor Further Information\nAlba Mineral Resources plc\nRetail Offer\nCMC CapX\nT: +44 (0)20 3950 0725\ncapx@cmcmarkets.com / tel: +44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nFurther information on the Company can be found on its website at\nwww.albamineralresources.com\n.\nThe Company's LEI is 213800Z1BU53AWR9J329.\nThis announcement should be read in its entirety.

CMC Markets UK Plc, trading as CMC CapX, acted as the Company's sole placing agent in respect of the Placing.\nThe Company also provides details in this announcement of a proposed retail offer via CMC CapX (the \"\nRetail Offer\n\").\nThe Company is also delighted to announce that it has acquired an option to earn into the Finnsbo Rare Earth Project in Sweden.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nShare placing to raise \u00a3300,000 (before expenses) at 0.03p per share.\n\u00b7\nAlba also announces a retail offer to raise up a further \u00a3100,000 (which may be increased subject to demand) at 0.03p per share, to provide existing retail shareholders in the Company with an opportunity to participate in the fundraising.\n\u00b7\nOption acquired by Alba to earn into the Finnsbo Rare Earth Project in east Sweden.\nShare Placing\nThe proceeds from the Placing announced today to raise \u00a3300,000 (before expenses), together with any additional funds raised from the Retail Offer (further described below), are intended to be used to continue the Company's value-enhancing activities across the Company's portfolio, including:\n1. Clogau Gold Mine, Wales\n\u2022 Continuing the blasting and bulk sampling programme at the Llechfraith Target, our primary gold development target at the Clogau Gold Mine.\n\u2022 Upgrade works in respect of our processing plant to be able to process the gold content from the circa 300 tonnes of ore expected to be extracted from the current blasting programme.\n\u2022 The production and marketing of pure gold coins and other products from the gold extracted from the above exercise.\n2. Option over Finnsbo Rare Earth project in Sweden\n\u2022 Paying option fee, carrying out site visit and confirmatory due diligence and, subject to exercise of the option, conducting an initial field work programme.\n3. Other project opportunities\n\u2022 The Company is also in negotiations to acquire an option to earn into a portfolio of gold licences in East Africa which, if signed, will require the payment of an option fee (expected to be circa US$20k), the carrying out of a site visit and confirmatory due diligence. There is no certainty that these negotiations will result in the signing of an option agreement or, if it does, that Alba will subsequently exercise the option and commit to an expenditure programme on the projects.\n4. General working capital purposes.\nFinnsbo Rare Earth Project, Sweden\nThe Finnsbo Project is set in the historic magnetite mining district of eastern Bergslagen, in eastern Sweden in the province of Uppland, north of Stockholm (see Figure 1). The Project lies 15km north of the famous 540 yr old Dannemora magnetite mine.\nFinnsbo lies within the southern fringes of a major structural zone, the regionally extensive high strain ductile Forsmark Deformation Zone (FDZ) (see Figure 2). This ore province has produced some of Europe's most significant volcanogenic massive sulphide (or VMS) ore deposits such as the currently operating zinc mines Garpenberg and Zinkgruvan.\nMost workings on the Finnsbo licence area are Victorian-aged artisanal pits for magnetite and copper. The most significant working is Bredasen where there is a cluster of 30-40m deep vertical shafts.\nSampling by the present owners of historic blast material on surface at two separate blast sites, called Pop 1 and Pop 2, has returned very interesting rare earths assays at Pop 2 of up to 3.5% Total Rare Earth Oxides (TREO) (with overall grades ranging from 0.5% to 3.5% TREO), with 37-38% of the TREO in each case being made up of high-value NdPrDy (neodymium-praseodymium-dysprosium) oxides, as well as gold and copper grades of up to 27g/t (with overall grades ranging from 7 to 27g/t) and 2.9% (with overall grades ranging from 0.9% to 2.9%) respectively.\nFigure 1: Location map. Finnsbo Project shown in green. Insert map shows the Project's location in eastern Sweden (circled).\nFigure 2: Swedish Geological Survey map of historic workings and showing major FDZ structural trend running through the Finnsbo licence (outlined in red).\nThe principal terms of the option agreement signed with the owners of the Finnsbo Project (\"\nFinnsbo\n\") are as follows:\n\u00b7\nOption fee: \u00a310k (payable 50% in cash, 50% in Alba shares).\n\u00b7\nExclusivity period: 45 days for Alba to carry out confirmatory due diligence.\n\u00b7\nIf Alba exercises the option, on Completion of the formal transaction documents Alba will pay the owners \u00a315k (50% in cash, 50% in Alba shares).\n\u00b7\nAlba will then have that right to earn into the Finnsbo Project in stages, as follows:\no\nAt Stage 1 (12-month period): by spending \u00a3100k on exploration for a 25% interest in the Project;\no\nAt Stage 2 (a further 24-month period): by paying the owners \u00a350k in cash or Alba shares and spending a further \u00a3200k for a further 26% interest in the Project (for a total 51% interest); and\no\nAt Stage 3 (a further 36-month period), by spending \u00a3350k for a further 29% interest (for a total 80% interest).\n\u00b7\nThereafter, Alba has the option to buy the remaining 20% interest for \u00a3500k.\n\u00b7\nOnce Alba stops sole funding, the parties will joint fund or dilute in accordance with a customary dilution formula. If a party's interest reduces below 10pc, its interest will convert to a 1% Net Smelter Return royalty.\n\u00b7\nAlba is also being granted a 12-month option over two other Swedish projects owned by the same owners as Finnsbo, on the same terms as those applying to Finnsbo.\nThe owners of the Finnsbo Project have a well-established technical team based in Sweden which is available to continue to support field exploration activities. An initial site visit by the Alba team is planned for the coming days. Further updates will be released as appropriate during the due diligence period.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Alba's Executive Chairman, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to have secured this option over a very interesting rare earth prospect in Sweden. We have long flagged that we are open to other value-enhancing project acquisitions and investments. The reasonable earn-in terms, and the fact that the owners of the project have a well-established technical team based in Sweden which can continue to support work activities on the ground, make this an attractive proposition which complements, and is not expected to detract from, the Company's continued focus on the roll-out of blasting and development operations at the Clogau Gold Mine in Wales.\"\nRetail Offer\nIn addition to the Placing, it is proposed that there will be a separate conditional retail offer to existing shareholders via CMC CapX to raise up to approximately \u00a3100,000 (before expenses) at the Issue Price (the \"\nRetail Offer\n\", and together with the Placing, the \"\nFundraise\n\"), to provide existing retail shareholders in the Company with an opportunity to participate in the Fundraise. A separate announcement will be made shortly by the Company regarding the Retail Offer and its terms. The total amount which can be raised through the retail offer may be increased above the amount stated above, subject to demand.\nThose investors who subscribe for new Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Retail Offer (the \"\nRetail Shares\n\") will do so pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Retail Offer contained in that announcement.\nAdmission to AIM\nApplication will be made for the new ordinary shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission of the new ordinary shares will become effective at 8.00 a.m. on or around 12 November 2024. The new ordinary shares will be issued credited as fully paid and will rank in full for all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after Admission and will otherwise rank on Admission\npari passu\nin all respects with the existing ordinary shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the total number of ordinary shares in issue will be 10,736,939,266. The Company does not hold any ordinary shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of ordinary shares with voting rights will be 10,736,939,266. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market and business conditions, competition for qualified staff, the regulatory process and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting rights, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of regulatory and other third party consents and approvals, uncertainties regarding the Company's or any third party's ability to execute and implement future plans, and the occurrence of unexpected events. Actual results achieved may vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.albamineralresources.com\nor contact:\nAlba Mineral Resources plc\nGeorge Frangeskides, Executive Chairman\n+44 20 3950 0725\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nAndrew Emmott\n+44 20 3368 3555\nCMC Markets plc (Broker)\nThomas Smith / Douglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nAlba's Projects & Investments\nProjects Operated by Alba\nLocation\nOwnership\nClogau (gold)\nWales\n100%\nDolgellau Gold Exploration (gold)\nWales\n100%\nGwynfynydd (gold)\nWales\n100%\nInvestments Held by Alba\nLocation\nOwnership\nGreenRoc S\ntrategic Materials\nPlc (graphite - anode)\nGreenland\n34.34%\nHorse Hill (oil)\nEngland\n11.765%\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
