The Circular includes notice of a general meeting to be held at the offices of Arch Law Limited, Huckletree Bishopsgate, 8 Bishopsgate, London EC2N 4BQ at 9:00am on 6 February 2026. A copy of the Circular and the notice has been posted to shareholders today, and copies can be found on the Company's website at\nwww.albamineralresources.com\n.\nExplanatory sections 1 to 5 below have been reproduced from the Circular with minor changes for context.\n1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\nOn 14 July 2025, Alba announced the conditional acquisition of a controlling 51% interest in the Motzfeldt Project, a large and highly prospective niobium-tantalum-zirconium-rare earth element project located in South Greenland (the \"Project\"). On 28 October 2025, the Company announced the completion, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement of the same date (the \"Acquisition Agreement\"), of the acquisition of an initial 25.5% interest in the Project, as well as certain changes to the terms of the transaction first announced on 14 July 2025.\nAs announced on 28 October 2025, the principal terms of the transaction comprise the following:\n\u00b7\nFirst Acquisition: the acquisition by Alba on First Completion of an initial 25.5% interest in the Project and the payment or repayment, respectively, by Alba of a proportion of the accrued fees and loans owed by the Project owner, Elemental Rare Metals Ltd (\"ERM\"), for a total of \u00a330,000 in cash and \u00a3426,930 in Alba shares at a deemed issue price of 0.02414p per share (unchanged from the announcement of 14 July 2025), a premium of approximately 20% above the last closing price of Alba shares of 0.020p on 27 October 2025 for a total of 1,768,560,480 Alba consideration shares. This First Acquisition has now been completed, and the Company therefore now owns 25.5% of the Project.\n\u00b7\nSecond Acquisition: the acquisition by Alba on Second Completion of a further 25.5% interest in the Project, and the payment or repayment, respectively, by Alba of the remainder of the accrued fees and loans owed by Project owner ERM, for a total of \u00a3518,070 in Alba shares, at the same deemed issue price of 0.02414p per share (unchanged from the announcement of 14 July 2025). Upon completion of the Second Acquisition, which is conditional on the passing of a resolution under section 190 Companies Act 2006 (the \"Act\") and the Government of Greenland giving its approval to the change of control of the Project, a total of a further 2,146,103,977 consideration shares will be issued and Alba will move to a majority 51% interest in the Project.\nOf the total consideration payable on Second Completion, \u00a346,250 (for 191,590,720 consideration shares) will be allotted in payment of accrued fees owed by ERM to entities connected with Alba Chairman George Frangeskides, \u00a3106,675.50 (for 441,903,480 consideration shares) in repayment of loans owed by ERM to Mr Frangeskides and an entity connected with him and \u00a3285,144 (for 1,181,209,611 consideration shares) in consideration of the acquisition by Alba of a 25.5% interest in the Project (by the acquisition of 25.5% of the issued share capital in ERM) from an entity connected with Mr Frangeskides. References to entities \"connected with\" Mr Frangeskides are to two private companies of which he is a director, one of which is owned by his wife and one of which is owned jointly by him and his wife.\nAs announced on 28 October 2025, changes in the transaction from those initially announced on 14 July 2025, include, in particular:\n\u00b7\nInstead of Alba acquiring 49% of the Project at First Completion and another 2% at Second Completion, it has acquired 25.5% at First Completion and will be acquiring a further 25.5% at Second Completion, thus ensuring a more even split in the consideration paid by Alba across the two phases of the transaction.\n\u00b7\nSimilarly, the repayment of loans and accrued fees will now be split more evenly between the two phases of the transaction.\n\u00b7\nAlba's previous commitment to sole fund the Project up to an amount of \u00a3350,000 from First Completion will now be split so that the sole funding commitment from First Completion is reduced to \u00a3100,000, with another \u00a3250,000 sole funding commitment only applying as from Second Completion, once Alba has moved to majority ownership of the Project.\n\u00b7\nInstead of Alba having to reimburse 100% of the Motzfeldt 2025 field programme costs on First Completion, only 35% of those costs will have to be reimbursed at First Completion, with the balance of 65% being reimbursed on Second Completion, once Alba has moved to majority ownership.\nThe result of these changes is to substantially reduce both Alba's cash and share commitments at and following First Completion.\nAs previously stated, part of the consideration for the acquisition will be applied in the repayment of shareholder and third-party loans and accrued invoices through which the current operator and 100% owner of the Project, ERM, has funded the development of the Project in the past several years, amounting to approximately \u00a3375,000 in total across the two phases of the acquisition, with the balance of the consideration, approximately \u00a3600,000 in total, to be paid for the 51% controlling interest in the Project and allotted to ERM shareholders pro rata.\nAs announced on 28 October 2025, following Second Completion, a 51:49 joint venture will be established between Alba and ERM. Alba will act as operator and manager of the Project. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Alba will have a right of first refusal over ERM's remaining 49% interest. ERM will hold a tag-along right in the event of a proposed sale by Alba of its 51% stake. The Acquisition Agreement also provides that Alba shares issued in the transaction will be subject to a total of 12 months of restrictions on sale, namely:\n\u00b7\nan initial three-month lock-in from First or Second Completion (as the case may be) in respect of 100% of the Alba consideration shares;\n\u00b7\na further three months during which 50% of the shares will be locked-in and 50% will be subject to orderly marketing provisions; and\n\u00b7\na further six-month orderly market period in respect of all of the remaining shares.\nThe completion of the Second Acquisition is subject to:\n\u00b7\nGreenland Government approval to Alba acquiring a majority stake in the Project (which approval has been requested); and\n\u00b7\napproval at a general meeting of Alba's acquisition of the second stake of 25.5% at Second Completion.\nThe Circular concerns the Second Acquisition and seeks shareholders' approval for the acquisition of the additional 25.5% interest in the Motzfeldt Project and the allotment and issue of consideration shares on completion thereof. The company from which Alba is acquiring the additional 25.5% interest at Second Completion is connected with Alba's Chairman, George Frangeskides, it being owned by his spouse and Mr Frangeskides being a director of it. It should be noted that this entity did not participate in the sale of the initial 25.5% stake to Alba which has already completed at First Completion.\nAs the transaction constitutes an arrangement, known as a \"substantial property transaction\", whereby the Company is to acquire a substantial non-cash asset, namely 25.5% of the Project by the acquisition of 25.5% of the issued share capital of ERM, from a person connected with Mr George Frangeskides, a Director of the Company, and whereby, as part of the same arrangement, the Company is to procure the payment of accrued fees and the repayment of loans owed by ERM to Mr George Frangeskides and persons connected with him, as described above, the arrangement must be approved by a resolution of the members of the Company for the purposes of section 190 of the Act. A General Meeting has been convened for 6 February 2026 at 9 a.m. for shareholders to consider and, if thought fit, approve the necessary resolution (Resolution 1). Further resolutions will be proposed to grant authority to allot the 2,146,103,977 consideration shares to be issued on Second Completion under the Acquisition Agreement (as described above) and a general authority to allot relevant securities (Resolution 2) and to enable the Directors to allot equity securities on a non-pre-emptive basis (Resolution 3).\n2 RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION\nAs announced on 14 July 2025, the acquisition fits squarely within the Company's long-stated strategy which is to target assets that have a history of production or advanced exploration, and which thereby offer real potential to be brought into commercial production.\nThe acquisition of a majority stake in the Motzfeldt Project represents a transformational step for Alba, delivering:\n\u00b7\nExposure to multiple strategic metals in a single project;\n\u00b7\nA large, drill-confirmed resource base with clear and significant expansion potential;\n\u00b7\nLocation in a pro-mining jurisdiction; and\n\u00b7\nAlignment with global decarbonisation and critical materials strategies.\nThe Project also complements the Company's investment in GreenRoc, which is advancing the high-grade Amitsoq Graphite Project in Greenland, as well as Alba's earn-in to the earlier-stage Finnsbo Rare Earth & Gold Project in southern Sweden.\nThe Alba team has considerable expertise in operating in Greenland, having owned and operated four 100% owned projects there in the period 2016-2021, namely the Amitsoq Graphite, TBS Ilmenite, Melville Bay Iron and Inglefield Multi-Element projects. This included successfully completing the maiden drilling campaign at Amitsoq in 2021 and carrying out two separate drilling programmes at TBS in 2018 and 2021.\nAlba also continues to focus on developing the Clogau Mine in Wales.\n4 ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF THE GM\nFull details of how to vote on the Resolutions are set out in the Circular and the accompanying Form of Proxy.\nWhether or not shareholders propose to attend the General Meeting in person, they are encouraged to use the online Voting Portal, details of which may be found on the Form of Proxy (or email). Forms of Proxy should be returned as soon as possible, but in any event so as to be received by no later than at 9 a.m. on 4 February 2026 (or, in the case of an adjournment, not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the holding of the adjourned meeting).\n5 RECOMMENDATION\nThe independent Directors believe Resolution 1 to be considered at the General Meeting is in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the independent Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of Resolution 1 as they intend to do (or procure to be done) in respect of their own beneficial holdings totalling 70,958,658 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 0.4 per cent of the voting rights of the Company. Mr George Frangeskides and his connected entities will abstain from voting on Resolution 1.\nThe Directors believe that Resolutions 2 and 3 to be considered at the General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of Resolutions 2 and 3 as they intend to do (or procure to be done) in respect of their own beneficial holdings totalling 234,311,952 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 1.2 per cent. of the voting rights of the Company.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market, financial and business conditions, competition for and availability of qualified staff and contractors, regulatory processes and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting rights, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of regulatory and other third party consents and approvals, uncertainties regarding the Company's or any third party's ability to finance, execute and implement future plans and programmes, and the occurrence of unexpected events.

This maiden drilling campaign is expected to comprise three drill holes for around 300 metres in total (\nFigure 3\n). The programme is expected to last about two weeks.\nPrevious geochemical sampling at Finnsbo returned assay results at the \"POP 2\" location of up to 3.5% Total Rare Earth Oxides (TREO) (with overall grades ranging from 0.5% to 3.5% TREO), with 37-38% of the TREO in each case being made up of high-value NdPrDy (neodymium-praseodymium-dysprosium) oxides, as well as gold and copper grades of up to 27g/t (with overall grades ranging from 7 to 27g/t) and 2.9% (with overall grades ranging from 0.9% to 2.9%) respectively.\nSamples taken by Alba from the same location were found to contain visible gold and returned assay results including grades of 9.72 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 2.36% TREO.\nSubsequent to this sampling, Alba commissioned a specialist geophysics contractor to carry out a ground-based geophysical survey at Finnsbo. The results of the survey strengthened the indications that the more unique \"POP 2\" style of high-grade gold, copper and rare earth element (\"REE\") mineralisation is of magmatic origin and related to the intrusive tonalite. This confirmed the Company's thinking that the next stage of field work should focus on core drilling the contact zone starting at the POP 2 location and stepping out towards the southeast, seeking continuity of high-grade gold, copper and rare earth mineralisation. This is the objective of the present drilling campaign.\nFigures 1 and 2\n: Drill rig in background; geologists examining the drill core.\nFigure 3\n: Shows indicative position of three short drill holes (red lines) for 80-100m each, intended to locate high-grade mineralisation at shallow depth and check vertical continuity. Inset map shows location of Finnsbo in southern Sweden.\nAlba has the right to earn into the Finnsbo Project in stages, as per the Company's announcement of 6 November 2024, with the first stage comprising the right to spend \u00a3100k on qualifying expenditure over an initial 12-month period in order to earn a 25% interest in the Project, with the further right thereafter to earn or acquire in further stages up to a 100% interest in the Project.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market, financial and business conditions, competition for and availability of qualified staff and contractors, regulatory processes and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting rights, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of regulatory and other third party consents and approvals, uncertainties regarding the Company's or any third party's ability to finance, execute and implement future plans and programmes, and the occurrence of unexpected events.

Total consideration and ultimate interest in the Project remain unchanged.\n\u00b7\nAlba has completed the acquisition of an initial 25.5% interest in the Motzfeldt Critical Metals Project in southern Greenland, enriched in Niobium (Nb), Tantalum (Ta), Zirconium (Zr), and Rare Earth Elements (\"\nREEs\n\").\n\u00b7\nReview of 2025 drone photogrammetric survey at Motzfeldt reveals potential for greater zones of high-grade mineralisation at Merino Prospect at depth.\n\u00b7\nPre-blasting works at Clogau Gold Mine progressing.\n\u00b7\nDrilling at Finnsbo copper-gold-rare earths project scheduled to start w/c 4 November 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Company has also raised \u00a3500k (before costs) in a share placing.\nCompany Comment\nThe Chairman, George Frangeskides, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have completed the first phase of the acquisition of a majority stake in the Motzfeldt Project, the only one of Greenland's three large-scale rare earth projects which is not already in the ownership of a publicly listed company. Work is progressing well at Motzfeldt, with the present focus being on the review of the airborne photogrammetric survey which is providing remarkable detail of both the Aries deposit and the Merino prospect, which will be invaluable as we continue to develop our understanding of those sites.\n\"Work is also advancing in respect of the activities we need to complete at Clogau before we can blast, however these additional mandated works have materially extended both our timelines and our budget for the project, resulting in the Board's decision to raise further funds at this time.\n\"With that behind us now, we enter into a period of great promise and anticipation for Alba, as we build up to both the blasting of our main gold target at Clogau and the drilling of our high-grade Finnsbo copper-gold-rare earths prospect in Sweden in the coming days.\"\nAcquisition Terms and Related Party Transaction\nCertain changes have been negotiated to the terms of the transaction announced on 14 July 2025. While the total consideration for the acquisition by Alba of a 51% interest in the Project has not changed, the phasing of the acquisition has been modified, as follows:\n- First Completion: the acquisition by Alba of an initial 25.5% interest in the Project, for \u00a330,000 in cash and \u00a3426,930 in Alba shares at a deemed issue price of \u00a30.0002414 (0.02414p) per share (unchanged from the announcement of 14 July 2025), a premium of approximately 20% above the last closing price of Alba shares of 0.020p on 27 October 2025\nfor a total of 1,768,560,480 Alba consideration shares. This acquisition has now been completed.\n- Second Completion: the acquisition by Alba of a further 25.5% interest in the Project for \u00a3518,070 in Alba shares at the same deemed issue price of \u00a30.0002414 (0.02414p) per share (unchanged from the announcement of 14 July 2025). Upon completion of the second stage of the transaction, a total of 2,146,103,977 consideration shares will be issued and Alba will move to a majority 51% interest in the Project.\nIn particular:\n- Instead of Alba acquiring 49% of the Project at First Completion and another 2% at Second Completion, it has now acquired 25.5% at First Completion and will be acquiring a further 25.5% at Second Completion, thus ensuring a more even split in the consideration paid by Alba across the two phases of the transaction.\n- Similarly, the repayment of loans and accrued fees will now be split more evenly between the two phases of the transaction.\n- Alba's previous commitment to sole fund the Project up to an amount of \u00a3350k from First Completion will now be split so that the sole funding commitment from First Completion is reduced to \u00a3100k, with another \u00a3250k sole funding commitment only applying as from Second Completion, once Alba has moved",

This has been crushed at SLR's Wheal Jane facility in Cornwall and now awaits shipment to South Africa for the start of a comprehensive mineralogical and metallurgical test programme.\n\u00b7\nThe data from the hyperspectral drone survey carried out in the past summer is being worked on at St Andrews University, with whom Alba and the operator, Elemental Rare Metals Ltd, are collaborating, with results expected shortly. A student on the PhD programme at St Andrews University will be working exclusively on the Motzfeldt Project for the next three years, almost entirely funded by the UK's TARGET funding programme.\n\u00b7\nThe Company has been reviewing the funding programmes for which Motzfeldt may be eligible, with a view to ensuring that applications are ready to be made as new funding rounds open.\nFinnsbo (Sweden)\nAs previously announced, the Company is earning an interest in the Finnsbo copper-gold-rare earths project in Sweden. The status of the drilling programme is as follows:\n\u00b7\nApplications for consent for drilling have been submitted to the Municipality and the landowner.\n\u00b7\nA pre-drilling site inspection is scheduled for the week of 13 October.\n\u00b7\nSubject to receipt of consents on a timely basis, mobilisation for drilling is anticipated by the first half of November.\nClogau Gold Mine (Wales, UK)\nAs previously announced, recent work at Clogau has focused on implementation of the recommendations of HM Mines Inspector following a recent periodic visit.\nThe status of these works is as follows:\n(a) Works completed or due for completion w/c 13 October:\n-\nIndependent survey, report & plans in respect of ventilation system.\n-\nIndependent survey & report in respect of ground conditions and support design.\n-\nNew ladderways and safety gates installed.\n-\nNew safety platforms between L4 and L5.\n-\nCreation of new second egress.\n-\nShaft 2 second winch installation and water inflow diversion.\n(b) Works to be completed by the end of October.\n-\nIndependent mine survey of lower levels and integration with ventilation plan.\n-\nEnclosure for shaft 1 hoist cable and interlock system.\n-\nWork on Shaft 1 doors and Shaft 1 remediation.\n-\nShaft skip modifications.\n-\nShaft 2 head sheave support modifications and testing.\nThe overall timeline for the completion of these works has had to be extended due to the limited availability of specialist contractors.\nThe Company is now anticipating the start of the next phase of blasting in the first half of November.\nCompany Comment\nGeorge Frangeskides, Alba's Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"We are pleased to report on progress across our project portfolio. We now enter into a key period of time where we anticipate both blasting at Clogau and drilling at Finnsbo in the coming month.\n\"As for Motzfeldt, in the past week China has announced new export controls on five additional rare earth elements. With China already refining over 90% of global rare earths, this latest development underscores the importance of secure and diversified supply chains for critical minerals vital to electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence technologies. At Alba, our move into rare earth and critical mineral projects in Greenland and Sweden is aligned with the UK and EU's strategy to build resilient and responsible sources of raw materials for the energy transition.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market, financial and business conditions, competition for and availability of qualified staff and contractors, regulatory processes and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting ri",

Processing of approximately 11.6 tonnes of that ore yielded 108.6\u202fkg of concentrate, yielding 11.58 grams of gold after refining.\nAs previously announced, Alba minted three limited\n\u2011\nedition 1\noz, 24\n\u2011\ncarat\n\"\nTyn\n\u2011\ny\n\u2011\nCornel\n\"\nWelsh gold coins from gold extracted at Clogau. The first coin was auctioned in April 2025 for \u00a320,000, representing nearly an 8.5\u00d7 premium to the then spot price of gold. The second and third coins were sold privately for \u00a321,000 each, maintaining a similar premium. The prices achieved underscores the unique value proposition associated with Welsh gold which underpinned our move into Clogau and the Dolgellau Gold Belt.\nOn the processing side, modified gravity recovery plant trials returned an average concentrate grade of 450.6\u202fg/t, equating to an average head grade of 9.2\u202fg/t, signifying improved recovery performance from the Waste Tip.\nAlso in the reporting period, the Company announced the renewal of its exploration rights at Clogau through a new multi-year option agreement with The Crown Estate.\nIn late June 2025, after the end of the reporting period, an operational update reported on the progress of preparations for the next phase of underground blasting at the Llechfraith Target, including modifications to enhance penetration rates through the blasting sequence. Ore processing was reported to be continuing from the remaining stockpile, with approximately 4\u202fkg of concentrate at or en route to the refiner.\nAdditionally, it was reported that Alba plans to produce a limited series of 18\n\u2011\ncarat gold pendants using gold produced from the Mine. The maker\n'\ns mark\n\"\nGMW\n\"\nhas been registered and Alba shareholders will be offered a priority purchase window before wider sale\n.\nA preparatory blast was successfully conducted in late July 2025 at the Llechfraith target, our principal gold target at Clogau. However, a subsequent site visit by HM Inspectorate of Mines has identified remedial safety and compliance works that must be completed before further blasting can resume. Our team is working hard to schedule the contractors needed to complete these works as soon as possible.\nOn 14 July 2025, we announced the conditional acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in the Motzfeldt Project-a critically strategic multi\n\u2011\nelement asset enriched in niobium, tantalum, zirconium, and rare earth elements (REEs). The consideration comprises \u00a330,000 in cash and \u00a3945,000 in Alba shares, with the shares to be issued at 0.02414\u202fpence, a ~10% premium to Alba's 11 July 2025 closing share price of 0.022\u202fpence.\nComplementing this, Alba completed a \u00a3550,000 (before costs) share placing, with proceeds directed toward advancing the Motzfeldt Project, further Clogau development, and preparatory drilling at the Finnsbo project in Sweden.\nThe Motzfeldt acquisition fits squarely within Alba's strategy of targeting historically productive or advanced stage assets in stable jurisdictions offering commercial potential and critical metals exposure for the global energy transition\u202f.\nCorporate\nDuring the period, Alba issued shares as partial consideration for the exercise of the Company's option over the Finnsbo Rare Earth project in Sweden. A share placing was also completed for \u00a375,000 (before costs).\nFollowing the passing of the resolutions at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2025, Alba completed a subdivision of its ordinary share capital.\nPost period end, Alba announced that it had agreed to acquire a majority share in the Motzfeldt project and had completed a share placing for \u00a3550,000 (before costs).\nThe Company also recently announced the appointment of a new Principal Geologist, Dr Curtis Rooks, and that Mark Austin was stepping down from his position as COO and Senior Geologist and joining the Board as a Non-Executive Director for an initial six-month period, renewable by mutual consent.\nResults\nThe Group made a loss of \u00a3761,000 after tax (May 2024: loss of \u00a3639,000).\nOperating losses were \u00a3254,000 compared with \u00a3489,000 in the comparative period (\u00a3292,000 after deducting a one-off \u00a3197,000 non-cash cost attributable to the grant of new warrants and options in December 2023).\nNet assets at 31 Ma",

To ensure that the Company will continue to benefit from his extensive experience during the transitional period, Mr Austin will join the Alba Board as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 September 2025 on an initial fixed term of six months, renewable by mutual consent.\nAppointment of Principal Geologist\nDr Curtis Rooks will join the Company as Principal Geologist with effect from 1 October 2025. Dr Rooks obtained his PhD, which was funded by Elemental Rare Metals Ltd (the licence holder of the Motzfeldt Project), from the University of St Andrews, Scotland. The subject of his doctoral thesis was \"Controls on Rare Earth Mineralisation in Magmatic Roof-Zones, Motzfeldt, Southern Greenland\". Dr Rooks worked closely with Elemental in the period 2021-25 and led the field programme which was successfully undertaken at Motzfeldt this summer.\nDr Rooks' work at Motzfeldt has focused on the economic and petrological importance of late-stage hydrothermal processes when forming REE deposits in alkaline silicate systems. It is his work that has established the Merino Prospect at Motzfeldt as a potential second large-scale multi-element target alongside the Aries deposit. He is an experienced field geologist, familiar with working in Arctic and sub-Arctic locations, with several field seasons completed across Arctic Norway and Greenland.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Executive Chairman, commented\n:\n\"Mark has been instrumental in the stewardship of Alba's projects during the past five years, most notably at the Clogau Gold Mine. During that time, he has managed the main underground and surface drilling programmes, the Habitat Regulations Assessment of the Mine and various other in-mine and regional exploration programmes, as well as the most extensive rehabilitation and safety programme seen at Clogau in many decades. We are delighted that he will remain closely connected with Alba and Clogau as a Non-Executive Director, ensuring both a smooth transition for the technical team and that we will continue to benefit from his deep knowledge of the mine and operational matters.\n\"Curtis is a highly regarded geologist and a leading authority on the geology and mineralisation at Motzfeldt, having spent much of the past four years working on the project. We are delighted he has agreed to join the Alba team. The focus of Curtis's attention will initially be on our critical metals projects, Motzfeldt and Finnsbo, while Clogau, which is in more of an operational phase, will continue to be managed by Dr Peter Bolt, the Chief Mining Engineer for the Mine. Peter has been playing an increasingly more significant role at the Mine in readiness for the formal handover of responsibilities from Mark.\n\"With these changes, we continue to ensure that Alba will have access to the mix of skills and experience needed to drive our project portfolio forward.\"\nAdditional\nDisclosures\nThe following information regarding the appointment of Mark Austin, aged 67, is disclosed under Schedule 2(g) of the AIM Rules for Companies:\nCurrent directorships and/or partnerships:\nFormer directorships and/or partnerships (within the last five years):\nGreenRoc Strategic Materials Plc\nN/A\nGreenRoc Graphite Limited\nWhite Eagle Resources Limited\nWhite Fox Resources Limited\nMr Austin has a beneficial interest in 7,857,143 ordinary shares of the Company.

The current operator of the Project, Elemental Rare Metals Ltd, successfully completed a field programme last month including the following:\n- A ground radiometric survey at the top of the high-grade rare earth prospect, Merino;\n- Primary analysis of Merino to test the hypothesis that Aries-type mineralisation lies at depth;\n- The collection of ~100 samples from across Merino for assay, petrography and mineralogy;\nFigure 1: Sampling at Aries Deposit, Motzfeldt, July 2025\n- Analysis and sampling of the Merino \"chimney\" structures to test the hypothesis that they form from escape of mineralisation;\n- A photogrammetric drone survey at both Merino and the central Aries deposit area, which will allow for the creation of detailed 3D models and accurate terrain maps, aiding in geological mapping and the future planning of mining operations.\n- Analysis of the far face opposite Merino to assess it potential as a third extension of Merino.\nFurther results will be announced once a selection of the Merino samples have been assayed at an independent laboratory and the data from the radiometric survey has been assessed and interpreted. Being able to delineate a mineralised zone at Merino will be significant for the overall scale of the Motzfeldt Project, as it will expand the footprint of the project greatly, joining Merino to Aries ~1km to the south (Figure 2).\nAs previously announced, in the coming months Alba also intends to carry out a detailed mineralogical and metallurgical study of the Aries deposit, in order to establish the optimal processing routes for Aries material. This will be undertaken using the 2.5 tonne bulk sample which has previously been collected from the Aries plateau by the current operator. In this regard, the Company has now selected its preferred contractor to supervise the study programme. They have requested a representative 300kg sub-sample from the bulk sample. This sub-sample will be crushed and delivered to the contractor in the coming weeks. They will then carry out detailed mineralogical studies on the ore, following by metallurgical test work involving magnetic separation, gravity separation and flotation. The full programme is expected to take some 3-4 months to complete.\nThe Company also intends to commence a Scoping Study or Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Aries Deposit in due course.\nFinally, Alba has held initial discussions with governmental agencies in order to explore the routes for securing non-dilutive or low-cost funding and other support for the development of Motzfeldt.\nFigure 2: Motzfeldt licence map (purple polygons) with Aries resource area and Merino and other key prospects marked.\nClogau Gold Mine (Wales, UK)\nA successful preparatory blast was conducted at the Clogau St-David's Mine (\"Clogau\") in late July. The purpose was to clear out a section at the Llechfraith Target on Level 5 which had not been fully cleared out in the last phase in order to allow the next phase of drilling and blasting to commence from a clean face. This preparatory blast was conducted under controlled conditions by specialist explosives contractors Orica.\nThe ongoing health, safety and compliance programme at Clogau has included completion by Alba's specialist contractors of a ventilation survey and a safe working load survey. A recent periodic visit by HMIM has recommended certain further assessments and works be completed underground prior to the resumption of further blasting. It is expected that these may t",

We anticipate that the technical modifications made will enable us to achieve greater frequency and progression through the blasting sequences.\n\"We are also delighted that our first significant field programme at Finnsbo, our high-grade gold and rare earth prospect in southern Sweden, has been successfully completed and appears, from our preliminary assessment, to have generated excellent data. Further technical analysis and interpretation will be undertaken, but this new data set for the licence\nconfirms that the focus of future work should be the drilling of a few short exploratory holes at the contact zone starting at the POP 2 location and stepping out towards the southeast, seeking continuity of the high-grade gold, copper and rare earth mineralisation we have encountered at POP 2.\"\nDetails\nClogau Update\nIn respect of the next round of underground blasting at Clogau, following further technical analysis and discussion the overall blasting plan remains as communicated on 13 March 2025, namely to reposition the first raise so as to be able to commence it much sooner in the planned blasting programme than previously planned (see Figure 1). This will involve commencing Raise 1 within 5 metres from the current face position of the No.5 Level Drive West, enabling an earlier transect across the projected payshoot. The raise will be developed at an angle of +50\u00b0 so that it will be self-cleaning, eliminating the need for time-consuming mucking out.\nOther technical specifications for the next phase of blasting have been modified with a view to achieving greater frequency and faster progression through the blasting sequences. The current intention is to complete Raise 1 first and then process it for its gold content before moving onto commence Raise 2.\nFigure 1: Section through Llechfraith showing the No 5 Level development in relation to the projected pay shoot. Blasting has taken place at the Drive West and the Drive East. 4.5 Level drive is off-reef which means that Raise 1 can be commenced from closer to the current No.5 Level Drive West position.\nFinnsbo Rare Earths & Gold\nThe Company is pleased to announce that the Finnish geophysics contractor appointed to perform a ground-based magnetic survey and data processing exercise within the Finnsbo licence in Sweden has successfully completed their work.\nFor the purposes of the ground magnetic survey, a 60ha polygon was designed covering a strike length of prospective ground from the west of POP 2 to the historic Bredasen shafts, a distance of approximately 1.13km (see Figure 2).\nThe survey was divided into 25m spaced lines to fill the 60ha polygon. A total of 23.74 line kilometres was traversed by the contractor's personnel using a continuous magnetometer with backpack GPS antenna, with the longest line running to 550 metres. The base station was setup on the southern border of the survey area. The survey utilised continuous sampling of one reading per second, providing at least one data point every metre along the line.\nA magnetic susceptibility survey in mineral exploration uses the magnetic properties of rocks and minerals to locate and characterise potential mineral deposits. It involves measuring the degree to which earth materials become magnetised when exposed to an applied magnetic field. The purpose of the survey at Finnsbo will be to provide information in the immediate area regarding the near-surface occurrence of the mineralisation that was sampled on surface. It is",

Our recent gold sales, which achieved 8.5x the spot price of gold, have given us great confidence as we move into the next stage of underground exploration and development.\n\"We are also excited to be about to embark upon our first significant field programme at Finnsbo, our high-grade gold and rare earth prospect in southern Sweden. Access to the rare earth minerals which are integral to so many of the high-tech products that we take for granted, from mobiles phones to cars, as well as to the global energy transition, has become an absolutely hot button topic for Western nations in the face of China's current near monopoly in the mining and downstream processing of rare earths. One of the attractions of Finnsbo, apart from its location in northern Europe, is that the rare earths and gold have been found outcropping at high grades at surface. This forthcoming survey should help us to understand better the potential scale of the target area.\"\nDetails\nClogau Update\nIn our last update (RNS dated 29 April 2025), we reported that further sampling, processing and refining of the Waste Tip trench samples had returned an average concentrate grade of 450.6 g/t, equating to an average back-calculated head grade of 9.2 g/t.\nThat exercise was focused on the\nIn the announcement of its Final Results (see RNS dated 2 May 2025), the Company confirmed that it had recently been granted a multi-year renewal of its exclusive exploration rights over the Clogau Gold Mine and surrounding areas. Following this news, the Company has been finalising its plans for the next round of underground blasting, with further details expected to be announced next week.\nFinnsbo Rare Earths & Gold\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has commissioned a Finnish contractor specialised in the carrying out of geophysical surveys to perform a ground-based magnetic survey and data processing exercise on a key target area within the Finnsbo licence in Sweden (see Figure 1). This exercise will commence in the next few days.\nThe total ground to be covered will comprise approximately 24 line kilometres with a 25m line spacing.

The Company put the second coin up for public auction recently, with the highest bid of \u00a318,000 failing to reach the reserve price the Company had set. Since the auction, a private collector has agreed to purchase the second and third coins for \u00a321,000 each.\nWith the gold price currently standing at almost \u00a32500 per ounce, the price fetched by these latest sales represents a premium of almost 8.5 times the spot price of gold, which is in line with the sale price achieved at auction for the first coin (see Alba RNS of 4 April 2025), which sold for \u00a320,000.\nGold Processing and Refining\nAs a continuation of the evaluation of the Waste Tip, further sampling of the -20mm screened ore has been undertaken. The sampling focused on material derived from Trenches 2 and 4, with samples processed through the recently modified gravity recovery plant. Initial sampling of Trenches 2 and 4 in May 2024 returned average head grades of 0 g/t and 5.33 g/t respectively (see the Alba RNS of 15 May 2024). This resampling was as much a test of the reconfigured plant layout as verification of the original trench sampling. Concentrate samples were submitted to an independent laboratory for assay, with the balance of the concentrates submitted to the Company's usual refiners to recover the total gold content.\nAll concentrate samples assayed by ALS returned gold grades for both trenches with a low of 0.6 g/t, a maximum of 23.9 g/t and an average of 7.9 g/t. The back-calculated head grade of the assays averaged 0.22 g/t. However, as before, the gold grades from the laboratory assays significantly understated the actual gold content in the samples. The results from the refinery showed an average concentrate grade of 450.6 g/t across both trenches, equating to an average head grade of 9.2 g/t (2.0 g/t for Trench 2 and 19.9 g/t for Trench 4).\nThe grade variability is a reflection of the irregularity of the gold distribution on the Waste Tip. However, the increased grades in general when compared to the May 2024 results in respect of material from the same trenches is also considered to be a consequence of the recent pilot plant process flow modifications made by Alba.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Alba Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"These latest results from the processing of Trenches 2 and 4 at the Waste Tip are very positive for the economics of future Waste Tip processing. The recent pilot processing plant modifications appear to have significantly improved gold recoveries when compared to the exercise that was undertaken in May 2024.\n\"We are delighted to have achieved such a high price for the sale of our limited edition Tyn-y-Cornel series gold coins. This underlines the serious commercial potential of the Clogau-St David's Gold Mine.\"\nFigure 1: The Company has minted three limited edition, \"Tyn-y-Cornel\" series, 1oz, 24-carat Welsh gold coins, made solely from gold mined from the Clogau-St David's Gold Mine, with the first coin selling at auction for \u00a320,000 and the second and third coins for \u00a321,000 each.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market, financial and business conditions, competition for and availability of qualified staff and contractors, regulatory processes and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting rights, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of regulatory and other third party consents and approvals, uncertainties regarding the Company's or any third party's ability to finance, execute and implement future plans and programmes, and the occurrence of",

From the processing of 11.6 tonnes of newly blasted ore, 108.6 kg of concentrates have been sent to the Company's usual third party refiner and all these concentrates have now been refined, recovering 11.58 grams of gold. In that regard, it should be noted that the Level 5 blasting programme has not yet reached the proposed first incline raise (see Figure 1). Therefore, the blasted material to date does not represent the projected high-grade zone. The incline raises are designed to intersect the projected payshoot, thereby maximising the prospects of recovering economic grades and quantities of gold.\nFigure 1: Section through Llechfraith showing the 5 Level development in relation to the projected pay shoot. Blasting has taken place at the Drive West and the Drive East. 4.5 Level drive is off-reef which means that Raise 1 can be commenced from closer to the current No.5 Level Drive West position.\nAs indicated in our last operational update, the Company has been making improvements to the Company's pilot processing plant to improve the efficiency and recovery of processing. The improvements have included:\n- Repositioning of the wave table in front of the shaking table, involving the installation of a new concrete plinth for the wave table.\n- Installation of a trommel to screen out oversize and enable a fine-grained delivery to the tables (Figure 2).\n-\nModifications to the hammer mill screens in order to limit oversize material.\nFigure 2: Newly installed trommel.\nBlasting Programme\nGiven the slower than anticipated progress of the first blasting programme, as outlined in our announcement of 11 December 2024, following a further review by our technical team it has been decided to reposition the first raise so as to be able to commence it much sooner in the planned blasting programme than previously planned (see Figure 1).\nRaise 1 can be commenced within 5 metres from the current face position of the No.5 Level Drive West. This will result in an earlier transect across the projected payshoot. The raise will be developed at an angle of +50\u00b0 so that it will be self-cleaning, eliminating the need for time-consuming mucking out.\nRevised Work Programme\nAlba's planned ongoing work programme can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nFirstly, complete the processing of the current surface stockpiles comprising the balance of the Waste Tip trenching material and No.5 Level blasted and historical material, totalling around 145 tonnes.\n\u00b7\nSecondly, given the success of the Waste Pit sampling programme to date, where bulk grades of up to 3 g/t gold were defined, complete the Waste Pit trenching programme.\n\u00b7\nThirdly, resume the underground development programme on No.5 Level to complete the planned 1-2 incline raises.\nAppointment of Chief Mining Engineer\nThe Company is very pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Peter Bolt as Chief Mining Engineer for the Clogau Gold Mine. Peter Bolt is a highly experienced mining engineer, with a degree and PhD from Cardiff University. He worked for a decade at SRK (UK) Ltd, becoming Principal Mining Engineer. Between 2002-7 he worked as a director of AIM-quoted mining companies, including managing the underground development programme at the Quintana Gold Mine in Colombia. In 2007 Peter joined Continental Gold as VP Operations, responsible for their exploration and development projects in Colombia, including the Buritica, Machuca and El Limon mines. In recent years, Peter worked as an independent consultant on mining projects in Europe and Africa and was a consultant with WSP for 6 years. He has previously consulted to the Company in relation to the Clogau Gold Project.\nFigure 3: Peter Bolt and Mark Austin inspecting underground development (11 March 2025)\nGeorge Frangeskides, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"We are delighted to welcome Dr Peter Bolt to our team. Peter has a wealth of knowledge as a senior mining engineer, notably in relation to underground gold mines and processing operations, and we have already begun to see the benefits of that in terms of our formulation of a forward plan for Clogau.\n\"While the gold recovered to date from the processing and refining of the newly blasted material from No.5 Level is modest, the firs",

The high level of sulphide mineralisation within the projected payshoot considered good indicator of associated gold mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nVisible gold also identified within blasted ore.\n\u00b7\nBlasting progress slower than anticipated due to large volume of historic ore to be removed plus insufficient air pressure to rock drills (since rectified by order of larger compressor).\n\u00b7\nProcessing of test batches of blasted ore to commence shortly. Investigations continue relating to appropriate plant upgrades to enable faster processing of ore than current pilot plant can achieve.\n\u00b7\nCompany's underground pump system has coped with huge increase in rain caused by Storm Darragh. Main access road had been partly washed away but was repaired over weekend to allow operations to continue without interruption.\nOptioned Projects\n\u00b7\nSite visits conducted by Alba at Finnsbo and Norrby Projects in Sweden.\n\u00b7\nSampling of highly interesting Finnsbo outcrop returned anomalous results for both gold and REE, including grades of >10 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 2.36% TREO, in line with high-grade results previously reported by Project owners and corroborating presence of visible gold identified during site visit.\n\u00b7\nSite visits conducted to optioned gold licences in Tanzania. Full report of consulting geologist awaited, together with assay results from samples collected.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"Since our last update, our underground operations at Clogau have continued around the clock. Despite blasting operations being impeded by the sheer volume of historic ore we encountered on Level 5, all of which had to be painstakingly cleared out and removed to surface, we have nonetheless collected some 120 tonnes of material for processing so far.\n\"The presence of significant amounts of visible sulphides in the blasted rock is very encouraging, as is the identification of visible gold. The processing of test batches of the blasted ore through the Company's pilot plant will be commencing shortly. The much larger exercise to process the bulk sample in its entirety will have to await our determination of the appropriate upgrades to allow for a much larger daily throughput of ore than our pilot plant can currently handle. We are in ongoing discussions with our technical consultants about this aspect.\n\"Site visits to our optioned projects in Sweden and Tanzania have been successfully completed. While we await assay results and a full field report on the Tanzanian licences, the preliminary assay results for Sweden are certainly highly encouraging and provide clear support for the high-grade gold and rare earth results previously reported by the project owners. Further updates in respect of our ongoing work on these optioned projects will follow in due course.\"\nDetails\nClogau Update\nUnderground operations are ongoing at the Llechfraith Target, Alba's priority target at Clogau, with further blasting having taken place at Level 5.\nSince the commencement of pre-blasting operations in early August, following the completion of the dewatering of Level 5, underground operations have been continuous at the Company's primary gold target, the Llechfraith Target, involving a team of up to seven people working a total of 565 man-days to date.\nSo far, 146 bags of ore (with an estimated total weight of around 120 tonnes) have been removed to surface for processing and assaying, comprising a combination of newly blasted ore and ore from historic mining activities.\nThe volume of ore found in situ at Levels 4 and 5 from historic mining operations continues to exceed what was anticipated, with in total some 65 tonnes having to be cleared out (a significant increase on the 25 tonnes reported at the time of the last operational update RNS on 29 October 2024). Although this has added significantly to the Company's timeline for the completion of its planned bulk sampling exercise, this additional ore will be processed for its gold content.\nAll blasting to date has been successfully completed, however progress towards the first raise has not been as rapid as",

The project owners are entitled to convert their licence applications into granted licences at any time, subject to payment of the grant fee.\nMidas Project\nThe Midas 1 and 2 licences are located in Nyangwale District, Geita, northern Tanzania. The mine site is situated 7 km south of the Perseus Nyanzega Gold deposit (3.1 million ounces (\"Moz\")) and 20 km north-east of major gold producer Barrick's Bulyanhulu Gold mine (3.4 Moz of Reserves, 10.3 Moz of Resources).\nThe licences are located in the regionally southeast-northwest trending Geita greenstone belt. This belt is considered a segment of the larger Sukumaland greenstone belt and is one of the larger greenstone belts in northern Tanzania. The licences are located adjacent to the main Geita Shear Zone and in contact with some small to medium-scale mines. The mineralised zones are confined to the south-north to southeast-northwest trending shears within a met-basaltic volcanic package. Alteration in the mineralised zones consists of silicacarbonate-pyrite with well-preserved shear fabric. Gold mineralisation is associated with grey quartz thin veins, stringers and boudins parallel to the shear fabric. The transported and residual soil cover is 7m to 9m deep, below which completely altered and sheared mafic material occurs to a depth of 50m. Most the oxidised zone is believed to have been exploited by artisanal mining.\nSystematic exploration work programmes within the area commenced in the mid-1990s involving surface geological mapping, interpretation and compilation of geophysical maps, soil sampling on specified soil grids, grab sampling as well as RAB and Air Core drilling programs. Target areas were followed up through Reverse Circulation (\"RC\") and Diamond drilling. Major gold company IAMGOLD undertook a 4-year exploration program 2006-10 which included regional airborne geophysical surveys, project scale soil surveys and trenching, exploration and metallurgical and hydrogeological drilling\nThe current owners are proposing to sink shafts to commence production in the near term, excavating and crushing ore on site then refining it to produce gold at a nearby contract CIP plant.\nFigure 2: Map showing historic drill intercepts within Midas 1 licence area, with mineralisation commencing 24 m from surface and grading from 1.13 g/t to 3.2 g/t. Alba has also been provided with historic drill data purportedly for Midas 2, which included intercepts of 1-3 g/t from close to surface (1-17m). All this historic data remains subject to review and verification by Alba.\nFigure 3: Location map for Midas 1 and 2 gold licences, with other significant gold deposits marked in yellow.\nBuly South Project\nSituated in the prolific gold-producing Lake Victoria region, the Buly South gold project is located just 10 km south of Barrick's Tier 1 Bulyanhulu Gold mine (3.4 Moz of Reserves, 10.3 Moz of Resources) and 5 km southwest of the Golden Horseshoe Gold mine (4.0Moz).\nFigure 4: Buly South Project (top left corner), part of historic drilling programme undertaken by Barrick.

Other project opportunities\n\u2022 The Company is also in negotiations to acquire an option to earn into a portfolio of gold licences in East Africa which, if signed, will require the payment of an option fee (expected to be circa US$20k), the carrying out of a site visit and confirmatory due diligence. There is no certainty that these negotiations will result in the signing of an option agreement or, if it does, that Alba will subsequently exercise the option and commit to an expenditure programme on the projects.\n4. General working capital purposes.\nFinnsbo Rare Earth Project, Sweden\nThe Finnsbo Project is set in the historic magnetite mining district of eastern Bergslagen, in eastern Sweden in the province of Uppland, north of Stockholm (see Figure 1). The Project lies 15km north of the famous 540 yr old Dannemora magnetite mine.\nFinnsbo lies within the southern fringes of a major structural zone, the regionally extensive high strain ductile Forsmark Deformation Zone (FDZ) (see Figure 2). This ore province has produced some of Europe's most significant volcanogenic massive sulphide (or VMS) ore deposits such as the currently operating zinc mines Garpenberg and Zinkgruvan.\nMost workings on the Finnsbo licence area are Victorian-aged artisanal pits for magnetite and copper. The most significant working is Bredasen where there is a cluster of 30-40m deep vertical shafts.\nSampling by the present owners of historic blast material on surface at two separate blast sites, called Pop 1 and Pop 2, has returned very interesting rare earths assays at Pop 2 of up to 3.5% Total Rare Earth Oxides (TREO) (with overall grades ranging from 0.5% to 3.5% TREO), with 37-38% of the TREO in each case being made up of high-value NdPrDy (neodymium-praseodymium-dysprosium) oxides, as well as gold and copper grades of up to 27g/t (with overall grades ranging from 7 to 27g/t) and 2.9% (with overall grades ranging from 0.9% to 2.9%) respectively.\nFigure 1: Location map. Finnsbo Project shown in green. Insert map shows the Project's location in eastern Sweden (circled).\nFigure 2: Swedish Geological Survey map of historic workings and showing major FDZ structural trend running through the Finnsbo licence (outlined in red).\nThe principal terms of the option agreement signed with the owners of the Finnsbo Project (\"\nFinnsbo\n\") are as follows:\n\u00b7\nOption fee: \u00a310k (payable 50% in cash, 50% in Alba shares).\n\u00b7\nExclusivity period: 45 days for Alba to carry out confirmatory due diligence.\n\u00b7\nIf Alba exercises the option, on Completion of the formal transaction documents Alba will pay the owners \u00a31",

Newly blasted ore currently remains underground but will be removed to surface for sample processing and assaying.\n- The volume of ore found in situ at Levels 4 and 5 from historic mining operations has greatly exceeded what was anticipated, leading to a significant ore extraction exercise being completed prior to blasting, involving some 25 tonnes. Although this has added to the Company's development timeline, it is considered overall positive as this additional ore will be processed for its gold content.\n- Site visits completed by HM Inspectorate of Mines, part of the Health and Safety Executive (\"HSE\"), and Natural Resources Wales (\"NRW\"), with some further remedial works requested by HSE having since been completed.\n- While these developments have pushed out the Company's timelines for the completion of bulk sampling at the Llechfraith Target, Alba now expects the next sequence of blasting to commence on Level 5 later this week. Following the completion of the next sequence, the Company expects to be able to provide an update on overall timings.\n- Blasts undertaken to date have been successful and confirmed that the rocks at Clogau are amenable to blasting by low-impact deflagrating explosives, which is a major positive as the Company moves forward with the development of the Project.\n- From the test gold production to date, the Company intends to auction a limited run of commemorative coins in the coming weeks. Further details will be announced in due course.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"Since our last update, we have completed a substantial amount of work underground. The need to clear out a large volume of residual ore, combined with additional remedial measures requested by the Mines Inspector, has pushed out our planned blasting timeline, however our mining team anticipate being able to recommence blasting on No.5 Level later this week.\n\"The blasting we have undertaken to date, both on 4.5 and 5 Levels, has been successful and confirmed the suitability of the deflagrating explosives we are currently using. This also gives us confidence that the blasting programme should be able to proceed efficiently from here.\n\"In related news, we have been working hard also on our plans for the commercialisation of gold produced from Clogau. We intend to release soon the details of a limited run of commemorative coins which are being produced from our test gold production to date.\"\nWorks Completed Since Last RNS\nSince the last operational update RNS on 30 August 2024, the Company has completed the following works, among others:\nUnderground Works\nAdit Level\n-\nConcrete bed laid and winch installed at the Main Shaft.\n-\nMain Shaft sheave wheel rehabilitated.\nNo.4 Level\n-\nSampling completed on No.4 Level.\n-\nOld ladders stripped out of Sub Shaft and new ladderways installed from No.4 to 4.5 Level.\n-\nVent ducting installed from Drainage Level to No.4 Level fan.\n-\nElectrical reticulation extended to No.4 Level for connection of fan and winch.\n-\nOld pipes cut and removed on No.4 Level.\n-\nConcrete laid for No.4 Level Sub Shaft winch bed and winch installed.\n-\nConcrete laid for Sub Shaft station area.\n-\nRoof bolts installed for sheave wheel at Sub Shaft.\n-\nPressure washing of walls.\n-\nNew Kubota KC70VHD-4 tracked loader delivered to No.4 Level in preparation for transport to No.5 Level.\nNo.4.5 Level\n-\nPressure washing of walls.\n-\nLadderway installed from 4.5 to 5 Level.\nNo.5 Level\n-\nBack up pump installed on No.5 Level.\n-\nAir line installed from Mine Yard compressor to No.5 Level.\n-\n25 tonnes of rock from previous periods of mining dug out from No. 5 Level and extracted to Llechfraith Mine Yard.\n-\nSump dug out on No.5 Level for siting of pump below floor level.\n-\nWater supply fitted for drilling of blast holes.\n- Pressure washing of walls.\n- Drilling of blast holes and blasting on No.5 Level.\nPilot Processing Plant\n-\nNew sump installed in plant to create a closed water system.\n-\nTailing pipes and water supply reconfigured.\n-\nNew hammers fitted to the mill.\n-\nPump motor changed and extraction fan repaired on the primary crusher.\n-\nOn-going test processing of various ores.\nSurface Works\n-\nCleared land access across the bridge from the Llechfraith Mine Yard to gain access to the historic explosives storage magazine.\n-\nBridge integrity inspection carried out by engineering consultant.\n-\nHistoric mine material cleaned",

The Company is also delighted to report on the successful completion of the first blast at the Company's priority gold target at the Clogau Gold Mine in north Wales (\"Clogau\" or the \"Mine\").\nCOMPLETION OF FIRST BLAST AT CLOGAU\nThe Company is delighted to confirm the successful completion of the first blast at the Llechfraith Target at Clogau on 28 August 2024.\nThe first blast took place at No. 4.5 Level. Eight blast holes were drilled. All detonated successfully, producing several tonnes of broken vein ore. This material will be removed to surface in due course and processed.\nThe next sequence of blasts is expected to proceed at No.5 Level. While the Company will provide periodic updates on the progress of operations on site, it will not be providing reports on each individual blast.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Alba's Executive Chairman, commented: \"\nWe are delighted to have successfully and safely completed the first blast at our main gold target at Clogau, the Llechfraith Target. To our knowledge, this is the first blast to have taken place at Clogau since the 1980s and is a testament to the skill and dedication of our mining personnel onsite. We look forward now to continuing blasting operations on No.5 Level.\"\nFigure 1: Historical section showing area, circled and coloured pink, where first blast took place on 4.5 Level (labelled \"5 metre Level\" on the drawing).\nFigure 2: left, Mine & Operations Manager Kobus Byleveldt inspecting quartz vein on No. 4.5 Level; right, broken quartz vein on No. 4.5 Level post first blast.\nHALF-YEARLY REPORT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 MAY 2024\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nI am pleased to present shareholders with a review of our activities in the six months to 31 May 2024.\n1. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES\n1.1 WELSH GOLD PROJECTS\n(Clogau-St David's, Gwynfynydd and Dolgellau Gold Exploration Project) (100%)\nIn December 2023, revised discharge and abstraction permits were granted to Alba, allowing the Company to dewater the Lower Llechfraith workings at the Clogau-St David's Gold Mine (\"Clogau\" or the \"Mine\") at a rate of up to 250 cubic metres per day, a significant increase to the previous maximum of up to 100 cubic metres per day. Consequently, the Company was able to complete the dewatering of the Lower Llechfraith workings down to No.4 Level in January 2024.\nSimultaneously with the dewatering exercise, the Company's specialist geotechnical contractors completed the installation of new platforms and ladderways to allow access to No.4 Level.\nIn February 2024, Alba announced that it had taken more than 40 samples from No.4 Level at the Llechfraith Target. These samples were processed at the Company's onsite pilot processing plant and the resulting concentrates were then assayed for their gold content at an independent laboratory. As announced during March 2024, composites of the concentrates returned exceptional gold grades:\n- Composite 1: 3.1 grams of gold were recovered from 49.2 kg of sample (dry weight), equating to a back-calculated head grade of 89.15 g/t or 2.87 troy ounces per tonne (oz/t).\n- Composite 2: 3.2 grams of gold were recovered from 34.4 kg of sample (dry weight), equating to a back-calculated head grade of 111.63 g/t or 3.59 oz/t.\n- Composite 3: 4.0 grams of gold were recovered from 36.9 kg of sample (dry weight), equating to a back-calculated head grade of 133.73 g/t or 4.30 oz/t.\nAlso in February 2024:\n- notification was made under Permitted Development Rights in respect of the Company's intention to proceed with the planned bulk sampling of the Llechfraith Target, in accordance with the previously completed Habitat Regulations Assessment (\"HRA\") and existing European Protected Species Licence (\"EPSL\") permissions;\n- the airborne geophysical survey undertaken over Alba's key regional gold targets across the Dolgellau Gold Belt (\"DGB\") was completed; and\n- following a review of the plan for future exploitation of the historic waste tip at Clogau (\"Waste Tip\"), the Company announced that it had submitted a notification under Permitted Development Rights to carry out a trenching programme prior to submitting a planning application for the Waste Tip.\nIn April 2024, the Company announced that three new gold targets had been identified from the review and interpretation of the first part of the magnetic data generated during Alba's airborne geophysical survey over the DGB. Two of the targets are located within the envelope of the Clogau Mine and represent the potential definition of new drill targets within the Mine. The third target has been identified on a fault that extends 4 ",

At the Waste Tip, the latest results from our processing of a significant, 9.5 tonne bulk sample of fines material from Trenches 1 and 3 combined have returned an average back-calculated head grade for those fines of more than 3 grams per tonne. This is a highly creditable result for an on-surface waste tip and gives us a lot of confidence in the exploitation of the Waste Tip as a whole.\nWe will continue and complete the remainder of our planned trenching and processing programme before making a final decision on the wider exploitation of the tip.\n\"As for our ongoing underground preparations, while we have discovered a lot of left behind ore on No.5 Level, together with what looks like tailings from past processing, which material will need to be removed to surface, on the plus side it provides a potential further source of gold content. We are pleased to report that we have so far found no other significant issues requiring remedial works on No.5 Level. Further updates will be provided in due course.\"\nDetails\nWaste Tip Processing\nAll of the fines collected from Trenches 1 & 3 at the Waste Tip have now been processed for their gold content. The results are set out in Table 1.\nTable 1\nOversize Mass (Kg)\nFines (-20mm) Mass (Kg) (Dry)\nTotal In-Situ Mass (Tonnes)\nConcs Mass Kgs (Dry)\nGold Produced (Grams)\nAverage g/t of -20mm fines from Trench\nTrench 1\n11901\n4284\n16.19\n9609\n16.4\n3.83\nTrench 3\n14719\n5299\n20.02\n14037\n14.2\n2.68\nTOTALS\n26620.11\n9583.24\n36.20\n23646\n30.6\n3.19\nThe Company is very pleased with the overall result indicated from this processing, which has returned a back calculated average head grade for the -20mm fines of 3.19 g/t. While these latest results indicate an overall head grade lower than the initial trench assay results reported on 15 May 2024, which returned an average head grade of 6.0 g/t from Trench 1 and 17.22 g/t from Trench 3, those results were based on sample sizes of only 66.04 kg and 60.63 kg respectively, being a far smaller sample size than the 9,583 kg sample on which the latest average head grade of 3.19 g/t is based.\nThe Company will continue and complete the remainder of its planned trenching programme before making a final decision on the wider exploitation of the tip involving the submission of an application for planning permission.\nFigure 1: gold results from Trenches 1 and 3 (images left and right respectively).\nUnderground Bulk Sampling of the Llechfraith Target\nThe updated status of ongoing preparations for the underground bulk sampling of the Company's primary gold target within the Mine, the Llechfraith Target, is as follows:\n- Alba's underground works contractors have completed a further round of safety and access works on No.4 Level, including installing ladderways to enable the team to access No.5 Level for blasting.\n- No.5 Level has been dewatered and is now accessible. An initial survey has not identified any further safety or remedial works required on No.5 Level, however there is a significant amount of material on No.5 Level, comprising ore and what appear to be tailings from previous periods of mining and processing at Clogau, which will need to be removed prior to the commencement of blasting operations. The material will also be sampled for its gold content in due course.\nThe Company's ongoing underground operations have confirmed that extensive historical development has been undertaken between No.4 and No.5 Level, with the existence of a horizontal level between those levels running at approximately 20 me",

We look forward to providing further updates as the work plan unfolds.\"\nDetails\nClogau: Waste Tip Processing and Refining\nAll of the collected fines from Trenches 1 & 3 have now been processed at the Company's onsite pilot processing plant and a total of 35 kg of concentrate produced.\nClogau: Underground Bulk Sampling of the Llechfraith Target\nThe status of ongoing preparations for the underground bulk sampling of the Company's primary gold target within the Mine, the Llechfraith Target, is as follows:\n- 100m of cabling is presently being installed and a new pump has been lowered to No.4 Level to enable completion of the dewatering of No.5 Level. The new pump is a sludge pump with a high head capability allowing for a single lift to the clarifier tank in the Llechfraith mine yard before its discharge into the nearby watercourse pursuant to existing permissions.\n- Alba's underground works contractors are currently on site to complete a further round of safety and access works on No.4 Level and, post dewatering of No.5 Level, to install ladderways to enable the team to access No.5 Level for blasting. Once No.5 Level is accessible, Alba and its contractors will survey No.5 Level for any safety works required prior to blasting.\n- Ventilation, in the form of fans and vent ducting, will be installed on Levels 4 and 5 for the removal of blasting fumes.\n- Compressed air will be extended to No.4 Level by the installation of about 40m of pipes linking to the existing air pipes located on No. 2 Level. Similarly, water pipes will be extended down to No.4 Level. Once No.5 Level has been dewatered, this will enable both air and water to be connected from 4 to 5 Level by means of flexible hoses.\n- A 5-tonne capacity winch is to be installed at the top of the Llechfraith Shaft with another one on No.4 Level, together with shaft doors and signalling devices.\n- A mining contractor has been selected for the underground programme. The blasting phase is expected to take a total of around 2-3 months. Blasting will be performed according to the following sequence: drilling blast holes and loading them with explosives; detonating the blast, followed by ventilation to remove blast fumes; removal of the blasted rock (mucking out); and winching of the blasted rock to surface for sorting, storing and processing. Each sequence of blasting is expected to allow the development to advance by just over 1 metre per blast.\nIn a revision to the previously published timeline, the current indicative timeline for the underground bulk sampling exercise is as follows:\na. Site mobilisation and preparation: June/July.\nb. Blasting, ore removal and sorting: July to September.\nc. Processing ore to gold concentrate and then refining & smelting: TBA.\nRegarding the last point above, the blasting programme is expected to result in the collection of a bulk sample of ~300 tonnes. As such, the Company is in the process of considering the most efficient approach to the processing of that amount of ore, which is expected to require an upgrade to the capacity of the Company's existing onsite pilot plant. Further information about this will be released in due course.\nFigure 1: (left) personnel from Alba's underground works contractor inspe",

The team have been doing sterling work recently to further improve plant efficiencies onsite, which should translate into lower weights of concentrates having to be sent offsite, greatly enhancing the overall economics for the processing and production of gold at Clogau. The underground plan is also progressing well, and in that regard I am delighted to welcome our new Mine & Operations Manager, Kobus Byleveldt, to the team. Kobus is highly experienced in all aspects of underground gold mine planning, construction and development. He is a really strong addition to our existing team and will be supporting our COO Mark Austin as we roll out the next phases of work at Clogau.\"\nDetails\nOnsite Pilot Processing Plant and Waste Tip Processing\nFurther improvements have been made to the Company's onsite pilot processing plant at Clogau. In particular, a milling stage has been added to the process circuit and material is now being subjected to several passes over the shaking and wave tables. These adaptations have succeeded in greatly reducing the weight of concentrate which will have to be sent offsite for final refining. This in turn is expected to materially improve the overall economics of the production of gold from Clogau.\nAs reported on 15 May 2024, in the first phase of trenching over the Waste Tip a total of 33 tonnes of fines were collected from four trenches. The processing and refining of samples from each of those trenches resulted in Trench 3 returning the highest-grade results, with a back-calculated head grade of 17.22 g/t or 0.55 oz/t. All of Trench 3 has now been processed at the Company's onsite processing plant. The gold content of the Trench 3 concentrates will only be known once those concentrates have been refined at the Company's offsite refiner.\nUnderground Bulk Sampling of the Llechfraith Target\nPreparations are ongoing for the underground bulk sampling of the Company's primary gold target within the Mine, the Llechfraith Target. A final development plan is now in place for taking bulk samples from two zones (see Figure 1). The forward work plan includes the following aspects, among others:\n-\nCompletion of dewatering down to No. 5 Level. At present, the water level within the Lower Llechfraith workings remains steady below No. 4 level, despite recent heavy rains. A high-powered pump has recently been acquired in order to facilitate the completion of dewatering down to No.5 Level and, thereafter, in order to maintain the water level below No. 5 Level.\n-\nImplementation of appropriate measures in relation to the handling and use of explosives. Access to the historic explosives magazine close to the Mine has been reinstated and a site visit undertaken by the Police as the issuer of the necessary explosives certificate.\n-\nThe selection of specialist contractors is nearing completion, notably contractors who will undertake: the No. 5 Level safety works; the installation of ventilation, compressed air and water pipes to the lower levels; the installation of a 5-tonne winch system from No.5 Level to the top of the Llechfraith Shaft; the supply and use of explosives; and the bulk sampling operation itself (i.e., drilling, blasting and mucking out).\nAppointment of Highly Experienced Mine & Operations Manager\nTo assist in this next stage of development at Clogau, ",

Once we have completed the processing of this batch of 33 tonnes of fines from the Waste Tip within our onsite processing plant, we intend to send the gold concentrates produced for refining in the same way.\"\nDetails\nFrom the Company's initial trenching of the Waste Tip, which has produced a total of 33 tonnes of\nThe composite samples from trenches 1, 3 and 4 returned a total of 5.1 grams of gold. The sample from trench 2 did not return any gold content, indicating that this particular part of the tip is likely to consist of country rock from the original off-reef development of Tyn y Cornel rather than including waste rock from on-reef production development.\nTable 1: Composite Sample Results\n(figures rounded to two decimal places)\nDue to the erratic nature of gold distribution within the Waste Tip, it appears that laboratory assays have underrepresented the gold content of the section of tip from which the sample was taken. This issue is addressed by the refining of a gold concentrate, as this method extracts the entire gold content from the concentrate rather than merely sampling it.\nBy way of illustration, assay results from Pit 2 dug at the Waste Tip in 2022 (reported in the RNS of 21 March 2022) returned a back-calculated head grade of 0.28 g/t of gold. By comparison, Trench 1, which was dug in the same location as Pit 2, has returned a back-calculated grade of 6.0 g/t. Similarly, Pit 3, which was also dug in 2022, returned 0.83 g/t whereas Trench 3, which was dug in the current exercise and is directly along strike of Pit 3, returned 17.22 g/t. In both these cases, therefore, the latest round of trenching has returned results more than 20 times higher than in 2022. This is expected to greatly assist in our determination of the economic viability of mining the tip as a whole for its gold content.\nFigure 1: Comparison between trench results and previous pit results on the Waste Tip\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements relating to expected or anticipated future events and anticipated results that are forward-looking in nature and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as general economic, market and business conditions, competition for qualified staff, the regulatory process and actions, technical issues, new legislation, uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans, uncertainties resulting from working in a new political jurisdiction, uncertainties regarding the results of exploration, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of prospecting rights, uncertainties regarding the timing and granting of regulatory and other third party consents and approvals",

REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES\n1.1 WELSH GOLD PROJECTS\nIntroduction\nThe story at Clogau and the wider Dolgellau Gold Belt this past year has been of our team having to manage a series of obstacles to the implementation of our work programmes. However, due in no small measure to our ability to overcome those many challenges that have been thrown at us, as I write I am more optimistic than ever about the prospects for the Clogau Mine.\nThe most obvious example of those obstacles came during the course of the dewatering of our primary in-mine gold target, the Llechfraith Target within the Lower Llechfraith Workings. Having spent the best part of two years undertaking a painstaking Habitat Regulations Assessment for the Mine, and finally obtaining the permits in July 2023 to enable us to commence the dewatering of those workings, we then encountered freak and sustained rainfall of historic proportions in north Wales during the summer of 2023 which meant that our permits had to be effectively re-applied for, to allow for much higher pumping rates. Nonetheless, we now have those enhanced permits and are busy getting on with preparations for blasting and bulk sampling.\nIn this section, I cover the progress made at the Llechfraith Target as well as over our regional exploration targets and at the historic gold Waste Tip.\nClogau and the Llechfraith Target (100% owned)\nDuring the first half of the reporting period, much of our work was focused on securing the ecological permits required for us to be able to dewater and then explore the Llechfraith Target within the Lower Llechfraith Workings at Clogau, this being our highest priority gold target within the Mine system. During the second half of the reporting period and in the post reporting period, we have been getting on with implementing our work programmes.\nThe Llechfraith Target at Clogau has all the key geological characteristics",

Having employed the industry's standard techniques and premium instrumentation where possible, we are confident of the robustness of the Feasibility Study. This view is corroborated by the inclusion of a 25% contingency which forms part of the modelled capital cost of US$321M.\n\"This Feasibility Study firmly places GreenRoc as one of the few contenders to supply the European EV Battery industry with domestically produced active anode material. On behalf of GreenRoc, I would like to extend our gratitude towards Innovate UK for the generous support of a \u00a3250k grant towards this Feasibility Study though its Automotive Transformation Fund.\n\"There are further possible improvements to the process design which we will be looking into in a second stage, commencing shortly, and we will provide updates on that in due course.\n\"With the already positive Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Amitsoq graphite mine and now this compelling assessment of the economics of establishing a downstream anode processing plant for our graphite, our confidence in our plans for a vertically integrated production model for Amitsoq, from mine to battery anode material production, has been greatly reinforced.\"\nDetails\nThe Feasibility Study was project managed by the Company\nand\nconducted by SLR Consulting Ltd with\ncontributions from three expert consultants, namely Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, ProGraphite and Decision Risk Analytics.\nA key component of Li-based batteries is the active anode material (\"AAM\") which is composed of graphite in the form of coated spherical purified graphite (\"CSPG\"). Presently, China has a near monopoly, delivering more than 90% of the world's production of CSPG. With the energy transition seeing a gradual replacement of the world's internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles and a growing demand from Stationary Battery Storage Systems for solar energy farms and other uses, a 400% growth in demand for battery grade graphite is forecast by leading market analysts. There is therefore a political desire to urgently initiate production of domestically sourced and processed graphite for the European and North American battery industries.\nThe raw material for production of CSPG is natural f",

These basalts are also present in the Optioned Licences.\no\nLarge NE-SW trending structures present in the Roebourne basalts within AW1 have shown high lithium anomalies (1.8%\nLi\u2082O\n) further south-west in the Osborne JV tenement.\no\nA small section of the Andover Intrusion is present in the north-west of AW2. Given the Andover Intrusion hosts the Azure Lithium Discovery\n(\nwith a\ntarget estimate of 100-240 million tonnes grading 1.0-1.5% Li\u2082O), this represents a priority target for future exploration.\n\u00b7\nIf, following the carrying out of confirmatory due diligence during the initial 30-day option period, Alba elects to exercise the option for a 50% interest in the lithium rights over the Optioned Licences, it will pay GBP 250,000 in Alba shares at a premium of 25% above the VWAP of Alba ordinary shares in the 15 trading days prior to the exercise of the option plus 1 for 1 attaching 12 month share warrants at an exercise price of 0.2p per share.\n\u00b7\nAn unincorporated joint venture shall be formed for the exploration of the lithium rights over the Tenements, with each party contributing to expenditures on a pro rata basis and Alba being appointed Manager with ultimate responsibility for setting budgets and work programmes.\n\u00b7\nAlba shall have pre-emption rights and a separate tag-along right in respect of any sale or disposal by the other JV partner of its 50% of the lithium rights in the Tenements.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Alba's Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"We are delighted to have secured an option to acquire a 50% interest in the Andover West Lithium Project in the West Pilbara, including management rights. Western Australia is home to some of the world's biggest and best iron ore, gold and lithium deposits. The West Pilbara, where the Andover West Project is situated, has in recent years seen a surge in exploration for lithium, with the most notable success being the lithium discovery made by Azure Minerals on a neighbouring licence last year which has resulted in its imminent takeover for A$1.7 billion. High-grade lithium has also been found across a number of other neighbouring licence areas.\n\"While lithium prices have come off substantially in recent times as various global and macroeconomic factors have taken their effect, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong with a significant supply shortfall forecast by the end of the decade.

These basalts are also present in the Optioned Licences.\no\nLarge NE-SW trending structures present in the Roebourne basalts within AW1 have shown high lithium anomalies (1.8%\nLi\u2082O\n) further south-west in the Osborne JV tenement.\no\nA small section of the Andover Intrusion is present in the north-west of AW2. Given the Andover Intrusion hosts the Azure Lithium Discovery\n(\nwith a\ntarget estimate of 100-240 million tonnes grading 1.0-1.5% Li\u2082O), this represents a priority target for future exploration.\n\u00b7\nIf, following the carrying out of confirmatory due diligence during the initial 30-day option period, Alba elects to exercise the option for a 50% interest in the lithium rights over the Optioned Licences, it will pay GBP 250,000 in Alba shares at a premium of 25% above the VWAP of Alba ordinary shares in the 15 trading days prior to the exercise of the option plus 1 for 1 attaching 12 month share warrants at an exercise price of 0.2p per share.\n\u00b7\nAn unincorporated joint venture shall be formed for the exploration of the lithium rights over the Tenements, with each party contributing to expenditures on a pro rata basis and Alba being appointed Manager with ultimate responsibility for setting budgets and work programmes.\n\u00b7\nAlba shall have pre-emption rights and a separate tag-along right in respect of any sale or disposal by the other JV partner of its 50% of the lithium rights in the Tenements.\nGeorge Frangeskides, Alba's Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"We are delighted to have secured an option to acquire a 50% interest in the Andover West Lithium Project in the West Pilbara, including management rights. Western Australia is home to some of the world's biggest and best iron ore, gold and lithium deposits. The West Pilbara, where the Andover West Project is situated, has in recent years seen a surge in exploration for lithium, with the most notable success being the lithium discovery made by Azure Minerals on a neighbouring licence last year which has resulted in its imminent takeover for A$1.7 billion. High-grade lithium has also been found across a number of other neighbouring licence areas.\n\"While lithium prices have come off substantially in recent times as various global and macroeconomic factors have taken their effect, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong with a significant supply shortfall forecast by the end of the decade. As Andover West is not a near-term production asset, the current price of lithium is not hugely relevant to our decision to invest in this project. Indeed, the massive correction in lithium prices in recent times has only been to our advantage as we have been able to secure terms with the vendor which I do not think would have been conceivable 12 or 24 months ago.

Two of the targets are located within the envelope of the Company's 100% owned Clogau-St David's Gold Mine in north Wales (\"Clogau\" or the \"Mine\") and represent the potential definition of new drill targets within the Mine. The third target has been identified on a fault that extends 4 km northeasterly in the DGB and thus falls within the Company's 100% owned Dolgellau Gold Exploration Project.\nKey Points\n\u00b7\nAlba commissioned airborne magnetic surveys over the Clogau, Castell Carndochan and Hafod Owen prospects,\nlocated in the DGB. These were flown between November 2023 and January 2024.\n\u00b7\nAs the target gold quartz veins are not magnetic,\nproxy structures (as in proxies for gold) are looked for in the magnetic data\n. In the case of Clogau and the DGB, discontinuities in the magnetic sill basement can be used as proxy markers for the possible presence of mineralised quartz veins and therefore worthy of further ground investigations.\n\u00b7\nThe two in-mine targets may merit follow-up underground drilling to define potential new economic zones of mineralisation. The third target will be subjected to basic ground exploration involving geochemical sampling and mapping and ground-truthing for the presence of any outcropping quartz vein.\n\u00b7\nThese new targets identified to date only relate to one part of the completed airborne magnetic survey. The interpretation of the survey data over the Carndochan and Hafod Owen prospects is awaited and will be reported on in due course.\nMark Austin, Alba's COO and Senior Geologist, commented:\n\"The airborne magnetic survey that we recently carried out over some of our key targets over the DGB is the first survey of its kind since the regional survey that was undertaken by the British Geological Survey in the early 1970s. Given advances in technology, this latest survey has revealed a lot more detail than was generated by that earlier survey. Thus, we now have data guiding us to the identification of specific exploration targets.\n\"The three targets that we have identified over the Clogau-St Davids survey area make a lot of sense in the context of the overall geological model we have developed over the years. From the drilling we carried out in 2021, we were able to identify vein structures parallel to the main Clogau vein, and this has now been corroborated by the aeromagnetic survey data. The advantage of two of the targets being in-mine is that we should be able to access them by the drilling of some short holes from the existing underground development, a much quicker and most cost-effective way to prove up these potentially new gold-bearing vein structures.\n\"These are exciting developments and we look forward now to the reporting of the interpretations of the Castell Carndochan and Hafod Owen survey areas to see what further targets may be revealed over this hugely prospective, and still massively underexplored, gold belt.\"\nDetails\nUnmanned aerial vehicle (or \"UAV\") magnetic surveys were carried out by Alba's specialist contractors between November2023 and January 2024, targeting\nthe Clogau, Castell Carndochan and Hafod Owen gold prospects within\nthe DGB.\nThe interpretation of the airborne survey over the Clogau prospect has generated three new targets of immediate interest. These targets will be subjected to further focused exploration or \"ground truthing\" to confirm whether they host mineralised quartz veins.\nAs the target gold quartz veins are nonmagnetic, proxy structures are used that can be identified in the magnetic data.\nThe targeted gold quartz veins are typically associated with the ubiquitous normal faulting of east to north-east (ENE) strike. Because these faults postdate the emplacement of the regional magnetic sill complex (estimated at a depth of 50 to 70 m below surface), they might exhibit discontinuities within the imaged magnetic field. These magnetic discontinuities are regarded as potential sites for further ground investigations, especially the intersection of structures. These are potential fault-related dilation structures, which may enhance permeability and consequent conduits for mineralised quartz veins.\nFigure 1.\nMap of lineaments of ENE to NE strike (Black) superposed with mapped quartz veins (Purple) underlain by a magnetic map generated from the 2023-24 aeromagnetic survey data.\nFigure 2.\nAeromagnetic map of the Clogau survey area showing the ",

As a result, those exercises can now proceed.\n\"The Waste Tip bulk sampling will proceed along a shorter timeline, as described below, reflecting the much more straightforward nature of that exercise. The underground bulk sampling, meanwhile, as one would expect, involves greater complexity in terms of engineering, logistics and safety aspects, not to mention the blasting of a significant volume of rock and its removal to surface for sorting and processing. Nonetheless, we expect to commence both processes in April.\n\"This is an exciting time for all of us, Alba management, Alba shareholders and of course all of our many friends and supporters within the local communities in north Wales, especially around Bonttdu and Dolgellau, as we finally move into this critical phase of work at our primary underground gold target deep within the Lower Llechfraith workings, work which will allow us for the first time to assess the overall gold grade in those never previously mined workings and in turn enable us to confirm the economic feasibility of recommencing commercial mining operations from the UK's largest gold mine.\"\nDetails\nUnderground and Waste Tip Bulk Sampling\nFurther to the Company's announcement on 22 February, following the completion of the statutory notification requirements in respect of Alba's planned bulk sampling of the Llechfraith Target and trenching of the Clogau Waste Tip under Permitted Development Rights, the Company is now in a position to proceed with both those exercises.\nIndicative timelines for both bulk sampling exercises are as follows:\n(a) Waste Tip exercise (to extract approx. 120 tonnes of fines for processing and smelting):\na. Trenching: April.\nb. Processing of bulk samples to gold concentrate: May.\nc. Refining and smelting of gold concentrates: June.\n(b) Underground Bulk Sampling exercise (to extract approx. 150 tonnes of rock from two newly developed raises for sorting, processing and refining):\na. Site mobilisation and preparation: April/May.\nb. Blasting, ore removal and sorting: June/July.\nc. Processing ore to gold concentrate and then refining & smelting: July/August.\nLevel 4 Sampling\nAs reported on 22 February 2024, the Company has taken more than 40 samples from No.4 Level at the Llechfraith Target.

The key piece of news in this release is that we have filed a notification of our intention to carry out bulk sampling at the Llechfraith Target, our No.1 gold target within the Clogau mine system. The filing of this notification follows on from the fact that we have now largely completed our assessment of the newly dewatered No.4 Level and found it to be in good condition overall, allowing us to move ahead with the detailed planning and layout of the bulk sampling programme below No.4 Level.\n\"In that regard, we have also now completed a substantial sampling programme on No.4 Level. The sampling of the existing development will provide us with valuable information to assist in the precise siting of the development layout for the bulk sampling below No.4 Level. While it is certainly a positive that we have seen a significant sulphide content in the samples tabled in our Processing Plant to date, we will need to await the publication of the assay results from our first batch of heavy mineral concentrates in the coming days.\n\"In other developments, on further analysis our technical team has decided to carry out a further bulk sampling programme at the Waste Tip before we submit a planning application for exploitation of the tip. While it is a little frustrating not to be able to crack on with the planning process, as we had intended to by now, on reflection we think this is the right approach overall. Finally, we are really pleased to have completed the airborne geophysical survey over some of our stand-out regional gold targets and look forward with anticipation to seeing the results of the data evaluation in due course.\"\nDetails\nLlechfraith Target\nThe Company has taken more than 40 samples from No.4 Level at the Llechfraith Target to date. Of those samples, 25 have so far been put through the Company's Processing Plant to produce heavy mineral concentrates. A majority of the concentrates produced to date have contained a significant proportion of sulphides, including discrete fine grains of gold.\nThese concentrates have been dispatched to an independent laboratory for assaying of their gold content. While the presence of sulphides is a positive, it is not in itself an indication of gold content or grade, so the assay results will need to be awaited\n.\nFigure 1: (left) sulphides (the lighter material) being separated on a wave table in the Alba Processing Plant; (right) panned concentrate showing significant sulphide content.\nAs previously advised, Alba is planning a programme of underground bulk sampling to test the mineralisation in the Lower Llechfraith workings.

The Circular includes notice of a general meeting to be held at the offices of Arch Law Limited, Huckletree Bishopsgate, 8 Bishopsgate, London EC2N 4BQ at 9:00am on 6 February 2026. A copy of the Circular and the notice has been posted to shareholders today, and copies can be found on the Company's website at\nwww.albamineralresources.com\n.\nExplanatory sections 1 to 5 below have been reproduced from the Circular with minor changes for context.\n1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\nOn 14 July 2025, Alba announced the conditional acquisition of a controlling 51% interest in the Motzfeldt Project, a large and highly prospective niobium-tantalum-zirconium-rare earth element project located in South Greenland (the \"Project\"). On 28 October 2025, the Company announced the completion, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement of the same date (the \"Acquisition Agreement\"), of the acquisition of an initial 25.5% interest in the Project, as well as certain changes to the terms of the transaction first announced on 14 July 2025.\nAs announced on 28 October 2025, the principal terms of the transaction comprise the following:\n\u00b7\nFirst Acquisition: the acquisition by Alba on First Completion of an initial 25.5% interest in the Project and the payment or repayment, respectively, by Alba of a proportion of the accrued fees and loans owed by the Project owner, Elemental Rare Metals Ltd (\"ERM\"), for a total of \u00a330,000 in cash and \u00a3426,930 in Alba shares at a deemed issue price of 0.02414p per share (unchanged from the announcement of 14 July 2025), a premium of approximately 20% above the last closing price of Alba shares of 0.020p on 27 October 2025 for a total of 1,768,560,480 Alba consideration shares. This First Acquisition has now been completed, and the Company therefore now owns 25.5% of the Project.\n\u00b7\nSecond Acquisition: the acquisition by Alba on Second Completion of a further 25.5% interest in the Project, and the payment or repayment, respectively, by Alba of the remainder of the accrued fees and loans owed by Project owner ERM, for a total of \u00a3518,070 in Alba shares, at the same deemed issue price of 0.02414p per share (unchanged from the announcement of 14 July 2025). Upon completion of the Second Acquisition, which is conditional on the passing of a resolution under section 190 Companies Act 2006 (the \"Act\") and the Government of Greenland giving its approval to the change of control of the Project, a total of a further 2,146,103,977 consideration shares will be issued and Alba will move to a majority 51% interest in the Project.\nOf the total consideration payable on Second Completion, \u00a346,250 (for 191,590,720 consideration shares) will be allotted in payment of accrued fees owed by ERM to entities connected with Alba Chairman George Frangeskides, \u00a3106,675.50 (for 441,903,480 consideration shares) in repayment of loans owed by ERM to Mr Frangeskides and an entity connected with him and \u00a3285,144 (for 1,181,209,611 consideration shares) in consideration of the acquisition by Alba of a 25.5% interest in the Project (by the acquisition of 25.5% of the issued share capital in ERM) from an entity connected with Mr Frangeskides. References to entities \"connected with\" Mr Frangeskides are to two private companies of which he is a director, one of which is owned by his wife and one of which is owned jointly by him and his wife.\nAs announced on 28 October 2025, changes in the transaction from those initially announced on 14 July 2025, include, in particular:\n\u00b7\nInstead of Alba acquiring 49% of the Project at First Completion and another 2% at Second Completion, it has acquired 25.5% at First Completion and will be acquiring a further 25.5% at Second Completion, thus ensuring a more even split in the consideration paid by Alba across the two phases of the transaction.\n\u00b7\nSimilarly, the repayment of loans and accrued fees will now be split more evenly between the two phases of the transaction.\n\u00b7\nAlba's previous commitment to sole fund the Project up to an amount of \u00a3350,000 from First Completion will now be split so that the sole funding commitment from First Completion is reduced to \u00a3100,000, with another \u00a3250,000 sole funding commitment only applying as from Second Completion, once Alba has moved to majority ownership of the Project.\n\u00b7\nInstead of Alba having to reimburse 100% of the ",

The acquisition of a majority stake in the Motzfeldt Project represents a transformational step for Alba, delivering: \u00b7      Exposure to multiple strategic metals in a single project; \u00b7      A large, drill-confirmed resource base with clear and significant expansion potential; \u00b7      Location in a pro-mining jurisdiction; and \u00b7      Alignment with global decarbonisation and critical materials strategies. The Project also complements the Company's investment in GreenRoc, which is advancing the high-grade Amitsoq Graphite Project in Greenland, as well as Alba's earn-in to the earlier-stage Finnsbo Rare Earth & Gold Project in southern Sweden. The Alba team has considerable expertise in operating in Greenland, having owned and operated four 100% owned projects there in the period 2016-2021, namely the Amitsoq Graphite, TBS Ilmenite, Melville Bay Iron and Inglefield Multi-Element projects. This included successfully completing the maiden drilling campaign at Amitsoq in 2021 and carrying out two separate drilling programmes at TBS in 2018 and 2021. Alba also continues to focus on developing the Clogau Mine in Wales.",

Even with a big cash injections, its mostly the legal compliance and reviews by Greenlandic and Danish authorities that will still be required for permiting, this is what  takes so long and slows everything down, no matter how much money you have. If the authorities can be persuaded to speed things up, especially the dreaded (but crucial) \u2018Environmental Approvals\u2019 this could be a huge game changer for Alba. So If the US can  persuade Denmark /Greenland to fast-track permitting and tweak environmental rules to speed up mine and processing plant construction, this could be a huge play.  I think Denmark/Greenland can be persuaded with some nice incentives put on the table....",

Key details of the acquisition and interest include: Initial Stake: By April 2012, Stellar Resources (then operating as CSS Stellar) held a significant stake in GMOW, which secured an exclusive option agreement from the Crown Estate to prospect the 120 sq km Dolgellau gold belt. Ownership Confirmation: By 2013 and 2014, reports confirmed Stellar Resources owned a 49.9% interest in Gold Mines of Wales, the operator of the historic Clogau St David\u2019s Gold Mine. Licence Scope: The acquisition gave Stellar Resources rights to explore the entire Dolgellau Gold Belt, which historically produced the gold used for British Royal wedding rings. Subsequent Exit: In December 2017, Alba Mineral Resources acquired the 49% stake in GMOW from Stellar Resources, eventually increasing its ownership to 90% in 2018 to take full control of the project.

The underground scanning of the extensive mine workings, and the 3D geological model that we are developing, will be invaluable assets in leading us to the principal targets for unworked gold mineralisation within the mine. And we are currently refining our targets for regional gold exploration. Having identified over 300 known gold occurrences within the wider Project area, we are certainly spoilt for choice.\" \"This is a known and vastly under-explored gold belt - the great majority of it under licence to GMOW - and we are excited by the prospect of exploring the highest priority gold occurrences in the coming weeks.

Besides other countries, China can out bid for them The USA needs the island to protect the west, nato is weak, infact nato is the USA as they pay for most of it. But I digress, once the ice has melted and a passage way is formed Russia and China will either take it, as its to a degree not defended, very few people not much military presence Trump is nothing like putin. He's not diplomatic, he gets to the point. Putin would be far more subversive about this, the fact that Greenland is in nato is the only reason/lots of ice that it hasn't been taken before",

This is the comment I received. I tried it because someone thought it was a coalmine:) Curving surfaces (top left / roof area) What you\u2019re seeing The rock layers in the roof are arched and curved, not flat. This curvature follows the tunnel profile but is also geological, not just blasting. What it means geologically These are folded foliation planes The rock has been ductilely deformed (squeezed while hot and under pressure) This usually happens during mountain-building events Why gold likes this Bends and flexures in structures create pressure drops Pressure drops = places where gold-bearing fluids deposit gold Many Clogau payshoots historically occur near fold hinges Planar features (right-hand wall) What you\u2019re seeing Flat, sheet-like surfaces They repeat at a similar angle down the wall Tools on the right are leaning against one such plane What it means geologically These are foliation planes or shear planes They act like pages in a book Fluids move along these planes very easily Why this is critical Gold-bearing quartz veins often: Sit on these planes, or Cut across them at a slight angle Historic miners followed these planes because they often led to gold Directional textures (lower left wall) What you\u2019re seeing Elongated streaks and stretched textures Rock looks \u201csmeared\u201d in one direction What it means geologically This is a shear fabric The rock has been physically dragged past itself Indicates a major fluid pathway Why this screams \u201corogenic gold\u201d Orogenic gold systems form in: Shear zones Fault corridors High-strain zones These textures are exactly what geologists look for when vectoring toward gold Putting it all together (important) This face shows: \u2714 Metamorphosed sedimentary rocks \u2714 Strong foliation \u2714 Folding \u2714 Shearing \u2714 Multiple fluid pathways That combination is textbook Clogau-style gold geology. It also explains: Why gold is erratic Why old miners missed zones Why Alba is advancing cautiously along structures Why grades can suddenly jump when a payshoot is intersected One key reassurance Nothing in this face suggests: \u274c barren granite \u274c simple waste rock \u274c unfavourable geology Instead, it\u2019s exactly the right host environment \u2014 the only unknown is where along these structures the gold pooled.",

Clogau, has produced diddly squat so far, just heaps of rubbish. Just one of GF's shambolic RNS's and that's another kick in the b****.

You all need to get real and brace yourselves.  I hope for the sake of my now small investment  90% down, that you are all right and I am wrong.

Key observations: Large sell blocks dominate the mid-session (multiple 5\u201314m trades around 0.0227\u20130.023), suggesting overhang from existing holders distributing into strength. Despite this, sizeable buy orders repeatedly absorbed supply at 0.0238\u20130.024, including multiple 1\u201310m buys, indicating institutional or coordinated accumulation rather than retail flow. The late trade at 16:29 (9.6m buy at 0.0235) after sustained selling is notable\u2014it suggests dip-buying rather than capitulation. The bid\u2013ask remained relatively tight (0.022-0.024) throughout, suggesting liquidity resilience rather than disorderly selling. Interpretation This looks like a distribution-to-absorption phase, not a breakdown. Supply is being met with demand, but price is capped near 0.024, confirming it as a near-term resistance zone. Conclusion Below 0.022 \u2192 sellers likely retain control Sustained holds above 0.024 \u2192 supply likely exhausted A clean break would require continued volume-led absorption, not just isolated buys In short, pressure is being absorbed, but the market is not yet free of supply.",

That level acts as a known resistance point. A clean break with volume would suggest that selling pressure has been absorbed, often attracting momentum traders and short-term liquidity, increasing volatility. What typically follows is a test of the breakout\u2014pullbacks to see whether 0.026 holds as support. If it does, confidence improves and price discovery can continue toward the next resistance area. What it would not, on its own, mean is a fundamental re-rating. Sustained upside would still depend on news flow, execution, and broader market sentiment. In short: A break above 0.026 would signal improving sentiment, not a valuation conclusion.",

On the upside, it would materially de-risk the geopolitical narrative around Greenland-based assets. That shift could improve access to capital, strengthen offtake discussions, and attract strategic partners aligned with US and allied critical-minerals policy. Market perception would likely move from frontier optionality to strategic relevance. However, this would not represent an automatic value unlock. Licensing frameworks, Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty protections, ESG standards, and development timelines would remain decisive. US involvement would more likely increase scrutiny and compliance expectations than accelerate production.

Key observations: Large sell blocks dominate the mid-session (multiple 5\u201314m trades around 0.0227\u20130.023), suggesting overhang from existing holders distributing into strength. Despite this, sizeable buy orders repeatedly absorbed supply at 0.0238\u20130.024, including multiple 1\u201310m buys, indicating institutional or coordinated accumulation rather than retail flow. The late trade at 16:29 (9.6m buy at 0.0235) after sustained selling is notable\u2014it suggests dip-buying rather than capitulation. The bid\u2013ask remained relatively tight (0.022-0.024) throughout, suggesting liquidity resilience rather than disorderly selling. Interpretation This looks like a distribution-to-absorption phase, not a breakdown. Supply is being met with demand, but price is capped near 0.024, confirming it as a near-term resistance zone. Conclusion Below 0.022 \u2192 sellers likely retain control Sustained holds above 0.024 \u2192 supply likely exhausted A clean break would require continued volume-led absorption, not just isolated buys In short, pressure is being absorbed, but the market is not yet free of supply.",

What typically follows is a test of the breakout\u2014pullbacks to see whether 0.026 holds as support. If it does, confidence improves and price discovery can continue toward the next resistance area. What it would not, on its own, mean is a fundamental re-rating. Sustained upside would still depend on news flow, execution, and broader market sentiment. In short: A break above 0.026 would signal improving sentiment, not a valuation conclusion.",

On the upside, it would materially de-risk the geopolitical narrative around Greenland-based assets. That shift could improve access to capital, strengthen offtake discussions, and attract strategic partners aligned with US and allied critical-minerals policy. Market perception would likely move from frontier optionality to strategic relevance. However, this would not represent an automatic value unlock. Licensing frameworks, Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty protections, ESG standards, and development timelines would remain decisive.

Is it just the result of the US wanting a weaker dollar plus geopolitical tensions, or is it presaging a paradigm shift in the global economy away from fiat money into asset backed currencies?  The central banks have certainly been steadily buying gold over the last few years. Or worse is it the Canary in the coalmine warning of a pending economic collapse as in 2007/8? To be honest I'd much prefer a slow and steady rise as these kind of parabolic rises usually end with a chunky sell off and long consolidation period thereafter.",

Is it just the result of the US wanting a weaker dollar plus geopolitical tensions, or is it presaging a paradigm shift in the global economy away from fiat money into asset backed currencies?

To be honest I'd much prefer a slow and steady rise as these kind of parabolic rises usually end with a chunky sell off and long consolidation period thereafter.",

Whatever the causes of the continual rise in gold I can only repeat what I said at \u00a32000 gold - it would take an exceptionally incompetent Alba management to fail to deliver meaningful shareholder value here. Going back to previous calculations on expected gold content of the adjoining quartz veins, I can remember arriving at a rough figure of around 80,000ozs remaining. That's about equal to the total of gold already mined. The current value of that 80kozs would be over \u00a3300m.",

          "content": "The trade data shows very heavy intraday volume clustered between 0.022 and 0.024, indicating an active battle between supply and demand rather than directional exhaustion. Key observations: Large sell blocks dominate the mid-session (multiple 5\u201314m trades around 0.0227\u20130.023), suggesting overhang from existing holders distributing into strength. Despite this, sizeable buy orders repeatedly absorbed supply at 0.0238\u20130.024, including multiple 1\u201310m buys, indicating institutional or coordinated accumulation rather than retail flow. The late trade at 16:29 (9.6m buy at 0.0235) after sustained selling is notable\u2014it suggests dip-buying rather than capitulation. The bid\u2013ask remained relatively tight (0.022-0.024) throughout, suggesting liquidity resilience rather than disorderly selling. Interpretation This looks like a distribution-to-absorption phase, not a breakdown. Supply is being met with demand, but price is capped near 0.024, confirming it as a near-term resistance zone. Conclusion Below 0.022 \u2192 sellers likely retain control Sustained holds above 0.024 \u2192 supply likely exhausted A clean break would require continued volume-led absorption, not just isolated buys In short, pressure is being absorbed, but the market is not yet free of supply.",

That level acts as a known resistance point. A clean break with volume would suggest that selling pressure has been absorbed, often attracting momentum traders and short-term liquidity, increasing volatility. What typically follows is a test of the breakout\u2014pullbacks to see whether 0.026 holds as support. If it does, confidence improves and price discovery can continue toward the next resistance area. What it would not, on its own, mean is a fundamental re-rating. Sustained upside would still depend on news flow, execution, and broader market sentiment. In short: A break above 0.026 would signal improving sentiment, not a valuation conclusion.",

On the upside, it would materially de-risk the geopolitical narrative around Greenland-based assets. That shift could improve access to capital, strengthen offtake discussions, and attract strategic partners aligned with US and allied critical-minerals policy. Market perception would likely move from frontier optionality to strategic relevance. However, this would not represent an automatic value unlock. Licensing frameworks, Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty protections, ESG standards, and development timelines would remain decisive. US involvement would more likely increase scrutiny and compliance expectations than accelerate production.

Motzfeldt\u2019s multi-commodity potential, particularly in niobium, tantalum, zirconium and rare earths, positions us strongly to support the transition to a low-carbon global economy. We look forward to accelerating exploration and development and unlocking Motzfeldt\u2019s considerable value. \u201cIn addition to Motzfeldt\u2019s strategic geology and resource base, its alignment with the critical raw material priorities of governments in the US, UK, EU, and other allied economies opens up the possibility of public and institutional support for the project. This offers us a significant opportunity \u2014 the potential to access grant funding, development loans, or strategic partnerships, which would enable us to advance the project with far less dilution than would traditionally be required on the public markets.

The challenge is not direction, but timing. Markets are often slow to price early positioning. Recognition typically follows validation \u2014 milestones reached, risk retired, and external conditions converging. When that happens, perception can shift quickly, not because the fundamentals changed overnight, but because they finally became visible. In that sense, both companies look less like speculative plays and more like options on inevitability \u2014 waiting for the market to catch up with what is already forming. Right place. Right time.

Decades of debt accumulation, reinforced by ultra-loose monetary policy, have left central banks constrained. Tightening risks destabilising highly leveraged economies; easing accelerates currency debasement. In such conditions, volatility becomes structural. This is not unprecedented. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, monetary discipline eroded, and real assets repriced sharply. Gold, silver, and energy did not surge due to speculation, but because fiat anchors were removed while fiscal expansion continued. Today\u2019s environment rhymes. Debt levels are historically elevated, real yields struggle to remain positive, and commodities are increasingly priced through leveraged paper markets. In silver, futures volumes frequently exceed annual physical production\u2014disconnecting short-term price action from underlying scarcity. Yet scarcity does not disappear. It accumulates. Industrial demand tied to electrification, defence, and supply-chain resilience is rising, while mining investment remains constrained. Historically, such imbalances have resolved not through policy finesse but through repricing. Volatility redistributes ownership from those reacting to leverage and policy noise to those aligned with structural reality. As Jesse Livermore observed: \u201cBe right and sit tight.\u201d Debt can be extended. Currencies can be managed. Scarcity cannot be printed. \u2014 Michael G.

Is it just the result of the US wanting a weaker dollar plus geopolitical tensions, or is it presaging a paradigm shift in the global economy away from fiat money into asset backed currencies?  The central banks have certainly been steadily buying gold over the last few years. Or worse is it the Canary in the coalmine warning of a pending economic collapse as in 2007/8? To be honest I'd much prefer a slow and steady rise as these kind of parabolic rises usually end with a chunky sell off and long consolidation period thereafter.",

Is it just the result of the US wanting a weaker dollar plus geopolitical tensions, or is it presaging a paradigm shift in the global economy away from fiat money into asset backed currencies?

To be honest I'd much prefer a slow and steady rise as these kind of parabolic rises usually end with a chunky sell off and long consolidation period thereafter.",

Whatever the causes of the continual rise in gold I can only repeat what I said at \u00a32000 gold - it would take an exceptionally incompetent Alba management to fail to deliver meaningful shareholder value here. Going back to previous calculations on expected gold content of the adjoining quartz veins, I can remember arriving at a rough figure of around 80,000ozs remaining. That's about equal to the total of gold already mined. The current value of that 80kozs would be over \u00a3300m.",

          "content": "The trade data shows very heavy intraday volume clustered between 0.022 and 0.024, indicating an active battle between supply and demand rather than directional exhaustion. Key observations: Large sell blocks dominate the mid-session (multiple 5\u201314m trades around 0.0227\u20130.023), suggesting overhang from existing holders distributing into strength. Despite this, sizeable buy orders repeatedly absorbed supply at 0.0238\u20130.024, including multiple 1\u201310m buys, indicating institutional or coordinated accumulation rather than retail flow. The late trade at 16:29 (9.6m buy at 0.0235) after sustained selling is notable\u2014it suggests dip-buying rather than capitulation. The bid\u2013ask remained relatively tight (0.022-0.024) throughout, suggesting liquidity resilience rather than disorderly selling. Interpretation This looks like a distribution-to-absorption phase, not a breakdown. Supply is being met with demand, but price is capped near 0.024, confirming it as a near-term resistance zone. Conclusion Below 0.022 \u2192 sellers likely retain control Sustained holds above 0.024 \u2192 supply likely exhausted A clean break would require continued volume-led absorption, not just isolated buys In short, pressure is being absorbed, but the market is not yet free of supply.",

That level acts as a known resistance point. A clean break with volume would suggest that selling pressure has been absorbed, often attracting momentum traders and short-term liquidity, increasing volatility. What typically follows is a test of the breakout\u2014pullbacks to see whether 0.026 holds as support. If it does, confidence improves and price discovery can continue toward the next resistance area. What it would not, on its own, mean is a fundamental re-rating. Sustained upside would still depend on news flow, execution, and broader market sentiment. In short: A break above 0.026 would signal improving sentiment, not a valuation conclusion.",

On the upside, it would materially de-risk the geopolitical narrative around Greenland-based assets. That shift could improve access to capital, strengthen offtake discussions, and attract strategic partners aligned with US and allied critical-minerals policy. Market perception would likely move from frontier optionality to strategic relevance. However, this would not represent an automatic value unlock. Licensing frameworks, Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty protections, ESG standards, and development timelines would remain decisive. US involvement would more likely increase scrutiny and compliance expectations than accelerate production.

Motzfeldt\u2019s multi-commodity potential, particularly in niobium, tantalum, zirconium and rare earths, positions us strongly to support the transition to a low-carbon global economy. We look forward to accelerating exploration and development and unlocking Motzfeldt\u2019s considerable value. \u201cIn addition to Motzfeldt\u2019s strategic geology and resource base, its alignment with the critical raw material priorities of governments in the US, UK, EU, and other allied economies opens up the possibility of public and institutional support for the project. This offers us a significant opportunity \u2014 the potential to access grant funding, development loans, or strategic partnerships, which would enable us to advance the project with far less dilution than would traditionally be required on the public markets. This is a compelling differentiator.\u201d (from the website/Critical Raw Materials/Motzfeldt) https://albamineralresources.com/company-comment",

Motzfeldt\u2019s multi-commodity potential, particularly in niobium, tantalum, zirconium and rare earths, positions us strongly to support the transition to a low-carbon global economy. We look forward to accelerating exploration and development and unlocking Motzfeldt\u2019s considerable value. \u201cIn addition to Motzfeldt\u2019s strategic geology and resource base, its alignment with the critical raw material priorities of governments in the US, UK, EU, and other allied economies opens up the possibility of public and institutional support for the project. This offers us a significant opportunity \u2014 the potential to access grant funding, development loans, or strategic partnerships, which would enable us to advance the project with far less dilution than would traditionally be required on the public markets. This is a compelling differentiator.\u201d (from the website/Critical Raw Materials/Motzfeldt) https://albamineralresources.com/company-comment",

Recognition typically follows validation \u2014 milestones reached, risk retired, and external conditions converging. When that happens, perception can shift quickly, not because the fundamentals changed overnight, but because they finally became visible.

Decades of debt accumulation, reinforced by ultra-loose monetary policy, have left central banks constrained. Tightening risks destabilising highly leveraged economies; easing accelerates currency debasement. In such conditions, volatility becomes structural. This is not unprecedented. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, monetary discipline eroded, and real assets repriced sharply. Gold, silver, and energy did not surge due to speculation, but because fiat anchors were removed while fiscal expansion continued. Today\u2019s environment rhymes. Debt levels are historically elevated, real yields struggle to remain positive, and commodities are increasingly priced through leveraged paper markets. In silver, futures volumes frequently exceed annual physical production\u2014disconnecting short-term price action from underlying scarcity. Yet scarcity does not disappear. It accumulates. Industrial demand tied to electrification, defence, and supply-chain resilience is rising, while mining investment remains constrained. Historically, such imbalances have resolved not through policy finesse but through repricing. Volatility redistributes ownership from those reacting to leverage and policy noise to those aligned with structural reality. As Jesse Livermore observed: \u201cBe right and sit tight.\u201d Debt can be extended. Currencies can be managed. Scarcity cannot be printed. \u2014 Michael G.

Key observations: Large sell blocks dominate the mid-session (multiple 5\u201314m trades around 0.0227\u20130.023), suggesting overhang from existing holders distributing into strength. Despite this, sizeable buy orders repeatedly absorbed supply at 0.0238\u20130.024, including multiple 1\u201310m buys, indicating institutional or coordinated accumulation rather than retail flow. The late trade at 16:29 (9.6m buy at 0.0235) after sustained selling is notable\u2014it suggests dip-buying rather than capitulation. The bid\u2013ask remained relatively tight (0.022-0.024) throughout, suggesting liquidity resilience rather than disorderly selling. Interpretation This looks like a distribution-to-absorption phase, not a breakdown. Supply is being met with demand, but price is capped near 0.024, confirming it as a near-term resistance zone. Conclusion Below 0.022 \u2192 sellers likely retain control Sustained holds above 0.024 \u2192 supply likely exhausted A clean break would require continued volume-led absorption, not just isolated buys In short, pressure is being absorbed, but the market is not yet free of supply.",

That level acts as a known resistance point. A clean break with volume would suggest that selling pressure has been absorbed, often attracting momentum traders and short-term liquidity, increasing volatility. What typically follows is a test of the breakout\u2014pullbacks to see whether 0.026 holds as support. If it does, confidence improves and price discovery can continue toward the next resistance area. What it would not, on its own, mean is a fundamental re-rating. Sustained upside would still depend on news flow, execution, and broader market sentiment. In short: A break above 0.026 would signal improving sentiment, not a valuation conclusion.",

On the upside, it would materially de-risk the geopolitical narrative around Greenland-based assets. That shift could improve access to capital, strengthen offtake discussions, and attract strategic partners aligned with US and allied critical-minerals policy. Market perception would likely move from frontier optionality to strategic relevance. However, this would not represent an automatic value unlock. Licensing frameworks, Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty protections, ESG standards, and development timelines would remain decisive. US involvement would more likely increase scrutiny and compliance expectations than accelerate production.

More importantly, I see growing US and broader Western strategic interest in Greenland\u2019s critical minerals\u2014driven by supply-chain security and the need to reduce reliance on China\u2014as a genuine structural shift rather than a passing narrative. Within that context, Alba\u2019s Greenland exposure and its shareholding in GreenRoc Strategic Materials increasingly resemble strategic entry points rather than long-dated speculative assets. My view is that this combination\u2014commercial gold potential in Wales and geopolitically significant minerals in Greenland\u2014increases the likelihood that larger players will step in, whether through partnerships or outright acquisitions, rather than these assets remaining underfunded and diluted over time. This is simply my interpretation of how geology and geopolitics may intersect, and why I believe Alba\u2019s risk profile is evolving from speculative toward strategic.",

Gold may have been found but not announced, equally it may not have been found and remains unannounced. No one knows yet but I live in hope of a positive announcement. Pendants would, I believe, be made in larger quantities than coins so quiet on that front may be expected. Ever hopeful.",

If you believe the geology and ongoing work still offer a realistic path to success, then much of the downside is already reflected in the price, while the upside remains largely unrecognised. Add to that a US dollar in a clear downward trend \u2014 a backdrop that has historically favoured higher gold prices \u2014 and the asymmetry becomes even more pronounced. In that context, the shares represent a long-dated option on gold, acquired for next to nothing, at a time when the metal itself already commands a substantial premium.",

Motzfeldt\u2019s multi-commodity potential, particularly in niobium, tantalum, zirconium and rare earths, positions us strongly to support the transition to a low-carbon global economy. We look forward to accelerating exploration and development and unlocking Motzfeldt\u2019s considerable value. \u201cIn addition to Motzfeldt\u2019s strategic geology and resource base, its alignment with the critical raw material priorities of governments in the US, UK, EU, and other allied economies opens up the possibility of public and institutional support for the project. This offers us a significant opportunity \u2014 the potential to access grant funding, development loans, or strategic partnerships, which would enable us to advance the project with far less dilution than would traditionally be required on the public markets.

Motzfeldt\u2019s multi-commodity potential, particularly in niobium, tantalum, zirconium and rare earths, positions us strongly to support the transition to a low-carbon global economy.

This offers us a significant opportunity \u2014 the potential to access grant funding, development loans, or strategic partnerships, which would enable us to advance the project with far less dilution than would traditionally be required on the public markets.

The challenge is not direction, but timing. Markets are often slow to price early positioning. Recognition typically follows validation \u2014 milestones reached, risk retired, and external conditions converging. When that happens, perception can shift quickly, not because the fundamentals changed overnight, but because they finally became visible.

Decades of debt accumulation, reinforced by ultra-loose monetary policy, have left central banks constrained. Tightening risks destabilising highly leveraged economies; easing accelerates currency debasement. In such conditions, volatility becomes structural. This is not unprecedented. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, monetary discipline eroded, and real assets repriced sharply. Gold, silver, and energy did not surge due to speculation, but because fiat anchors were removed while fiscal expansion continued. Today\u2019s environment rhymes. Debt levels are historically elevated, real yields struggle to remain positive, and commodities are increasingly priced through leveraged paper markets. In silver, futures volumes frequently exceed annual physical production\u2014disconnecting short-term price action from underlying scarcity. Yet scarcity does not disappear. It accumulates. Industrial demand tied to electrification, defence, and supply-chain resilience is rising, while mining investment remains constrained. Historically, such imbalances have resolved not through policy finesse but through repricing. Volatility redistributes ownership from those reacting to leverage and policy noise to those aligned with structural reality. As Jesse Livermore observed: \u201cBe right and sit tight.\u201d Debt can be extended. Currencies can be managed. Scarcity cannot be printed. \u2014 Michael G.

So please have restraint when posting all this hyped cr*p on here until GF can prove he is not a useless waste of space.",

Going back to previous calculations on expected gold content of the adjoining quartz veins, I can remember arriving at a rough figure of around 80,000ozs remaining. That's about equal to the total of gold already mined. The current value of that 80kozs would be over \u00a3300m.",

Price action is controlled and constructive, indicating positioning by stronger hands. If selling pressure fades and the bid lifts, 0.035 is likely to become support rather than resistance.",

Key observations: Large sell blocks dominate the mid-session (multiple 5\u201314m trades around 0.0227\u20130.023), suggesting overhang from existing holders distributing into strength. Despite this, sizeable buy orders repeatedly absorbed supply at 0.0238\u20130.024, including multiple 1\u201310m buys, indicating institutional or coordinated accumulation rather than retail flow. The late trade at 16:29 (9.6m buy at 0.0235) after sustained selling is notable\u2014it suggests dip-buying rather than capitulation. The bid\u2013ask remained relatively tight (0.022-0.024) throughout, suggesting liquidity resilience rather than disorderly selling. Interpretation This looks like a distribution-to-absorption phase, not a breakdown. Supply is being met with demand, but price is capped near 0.024, confirming it as a near-term resistance zone. Conclusion Below 0.022 \u2192 sellers likely retain control Sustained holds above 0.024 \u2192 supply likely exhausted A clean break would require continued volume-led absorption, not just isolated buys In short, pressure is being absorbed, but the market is not yet free of supply.",

That level acts as a known resistance point. A clean break with volume would suggest that selling pressure has been absorbed, often attracting momentum traders and short-term liquidity, increasing volatility. What typically follows is a test of the breakout\u2014pullbacks to see whether 0.026 holds as support. If it does, confidence improves and price discovery can continue toward the next resistance area. What it would not, on its own, mean is a fundamental re-rating. Sustained upside would still depend on news flow, execution, and broader market sentiment. In short: A break above 0.026 would signal improving sentiment, not a valuation conclusion.",

On the upside, it would materially de-risk the geopolitical narrative around Greenland-based assets. That shift could improve access to capital, strengthen offtake discussions, and attract strategic partners aligned with US and allied critical-minerals policy. Market perception would likely move from frontier optionality to strategic relevance. However, this would not represent an automatic value unlock. Licensing frameworks, Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty protections, ESG standards, and development timelines would remain decisive. US involvement would more likely increase scrutiny and compliance expectations than accelerate production.

      "why_they_matter": "Gold mining is a core part of the precious\u2011metal sector, supplying the global demand for investment, jewelry and industrial use. As commodity prices rise, the company\u2019s production can translate into higher cash flows and shareholder value.",
      "current_state": "The group has recently finished an acquisition of a Swedish mine, started a new drilling programme, and released a half\u2011year report that shows operational progress. It appears to be in a consolidation phase and is now trading near its lowest level."

        "ALBA has been busy making moves that suggest a bottoming process: it finished a major acquisition, kicked off a fresh drilling programme, and announced that its Welsh gold mine is now producing again.",
        "These events are all about survival and growth \u2013 the company is getting back on its feet and preparing for the next production cycle.",

        "dominant_theme": "Radio silence \u2013 no one is talking about ALBA on social media or in the press.",
        "bull_narrative": "No bulls left \u2013 the stock is essentially abandoned.",
        "bear_narrative": "Bears are screaming that the mine\u2019s costs are too high and that commodity prices could stay low, but the lack of chatter actually signals a contrarian opportunity.",
        "sentiment_shift": "From early panic to complete apathy \u2013 the market has moved beyond the initial shock."
      },
      "attention_check": "Google Trends is dead. A silent trend means the market is not yet aware of any upside, so a catalyst could produce a big surprise."

      "timing_regime": "The company looks to be in the late\u2011stage wash\u2011out phase of a crash. For contrarians, this is the ideal window to enter once a catalyst confirms that the bottom is closing."

      "lean": "Neutral \u2013 wait for a clear catalyst before committing.",
      "bull_case": "If the company delivers on its drilling programme and shows first\u2011production numbers, the stock could rebound 50\u201170% from its current level. The compressed price range and lack of market attention create a spring\u2011like setup that can snap back hard.",
      "bear_case": "Commodity prices could stay low, and the company may face higher operating costs or regulatory hurdles. The downside is limited because most of the decline has already happened, but a further 10\u201115% drop is still possible if the project stalls.",
      "risk_reward": "Risk of a 10% further decline vs. potential reward of 50\u201370% upside gives a 1:5 asymmetry \u2013 attractive for a contrarian trade."

      "if_watching": "Hold cash or a small position until the company reports first\u2011production numbers or a drilling success. Wait for a clear volume spike or a positive earnings surprise before moving in.",
