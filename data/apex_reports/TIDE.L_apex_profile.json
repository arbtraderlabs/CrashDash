UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\n24 December 2025\nCrimson Tide plc\n(\"Crimson Tide\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nCustomer Contracts Update\n\u200b\nCrimson Tide plc (AIM:TIDE), the provider of the mpro5 process management app, announces that it has received formal notice from a significant customer, a major retailer (the \"\nCustomer\n\"), that it intends to exercise a break clause in its existing contract with the Company. The break clause will take effect on 31 March 2026. To note, this does not relate to the contract renewal which was announced on 10 November 2025.\nThe Company remains in constructive dialogue with the Customer regarding transition arrangements and is implementing mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of this change.\nWhilst the Company is disappointed to lose a valued customer, this change will release considerable resources previously dedicated to servicing this account. The Customer's requirements necessitated significant bespoke development within the platform, which has constrained product development capacity. The conclusion of this contract will enable the Company to redeploy resources towards higher-margin opportunities, accelerate delivery of core product enhancements and support the Company's strategy to build a more scalable SaaS platform. Whilst there will be an immediate impact on revenue, the Board believes that this transition will benefit the Company over the longer term.\nThe contract, which commenced on 1 December 2024, represented approximately 12% of the Company's annual recurring revenue (\"\nARR\n\") for the financial year ended 30 April 2025 and 30 April 2026, albeit at below average margins for the reasons explained above.\nThe Company has separately secured renewal agreements with two customers, representing combined monthly recurring revenue (\"\nMRR\n\") of approximately \u00a314,700 for 12 months.\nBoth customers had previously served notice of non-renewal and were therefore classified as churned. Following a renewed focus by the current management team on customer retention, and the implementation of a structured retention strategy focused on maximising customer value from mpro5, the Company has successfully re-engaged and retained both customers.\nEnquiries:\nCrimson Tide plc\n+ 44 1892 542444\nChris Fielding, Non-Executive Chair\nJon Clarke, Chief Executive Officer\nRachael Rowe, Finance Director\nAllenby Capital Limited - Nominated Adviser & Broker\n+44 (0)20 3328 5656\nJeremy Porter / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nTony Quirke / Lauren Wright (Sales & Corporate Broking)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n19 November 2025\nCrimson Tide plc\n(\"Crimson Tide\", the \"Company\" or \"Group\")\nInterim results for the six months ended 31 October 2025\nCrimson Tide plc (TIDE), the provider of the mpro5 process management app, is pleased to announce its unaudited interim results for the six months ended 31 October 2025. In light of the extension of the most recent financial year to the 16 months ended 30 April 2025, the comparator figure for the income and cash flow statements is the six months ended 31 October 2024.\nFinancial indicator\nSix Months ended 31 October 2025\n(unaudited)\nSix Months ended 31 October 2024\n(unaudited)\n16 months to30 April 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n2,950\n3,008\n7,985\nGross Profit\n2,583\n2,620\n7,030\nEBITDA\n787\n74\n-38\n(Loss)/Profit before tax\n322\n-598\n-2,343\nCash\n1,495\n1,949\n1,251\nAnnual recurring revenue (ARR)\n2,781\n2,672\n7,272\nMRR\n450\n433\n468\nChurn rate\n8.83%\n12.09%\n18.00%\nGross revenue retention (GRR)\n91.17%\n88.16%\n81.60%\nNet revenue retention (NRR)\n96.22%\n91.01%\n96.97%\nChurn rate represents the proportion of Opening ARR that was lost from cancellations and downgrades over the period.\nGross revenue retention represents the annualised value of recurring revenue retained after customers lost from cancellations and subscription downgrades during the period, expressed as a percentage of Opening ARR.\nNet revenue retention includes the impact of subscription upgrades and expansions from existing customers, offsetting churn from cancellations and downgrades.\nChief Executive Officer's review\nThe six month period ended 31 October 2025 included significant changes in the management of Crimson Tide following the corporate challenges in the previous 16 months financial period. Chris Fielding joined as Chair on 5 June 2025, I was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to Chief Executive Officer on 22 July 2025 and Rachael Rowe took on the role of Finance Director on 8 September 2025.\nAgainst this backdrop of management change, Crimson Tide recorded revenue of \u00a32.95 million for the six months ended 31 October 2025, broadly in line with the \u00a33.01 million achieved in the prior period. The slight movement reflects a balance between new and higher-value renewals and contracts that ended during the period. We are actively engaging with our customers to reduce churn and are experiencing early signs of progress in this regard. Year-to-date churn is 8.83% (2024: 12.09%), and full-year churn is expected to be approximately 14%, lower than the 18% reported in the previous 16-month period.\nGross margin has remained broadly constant at 87.6 per cent (6 months ended 31 October 2024: 87.1 per cent).\nTotal overheads fell by 29% to \u00a32.26 million (2024: \u00a33.20 million), reflecting management's efforts to right size the business.\nAs a result, EBITDA increased to \u00a30.79 million (6 months ended 31 October 2024: \u00a30.07 million) and we produced a profit before tax of \u00a30.32 million (6 months ended 31 October 2024: -\u00a30.60 million).\nCash at the period end amounted to \u00a31.49 million (30 April 2025: \u00a31.25 million).\nOperational highlights\n\u00b7\nIn May, a major British supermarket renewed its mpro5 contract for a further three years. The total contract value is almost \u00a32 million with potential upside if certain performance measures are met.\n\u00b7\nIn July, Booker, a leading UK wholesale provider, had renewed its mpro5 contract. The contract, which is wider in scope and value than its predecessor, provides for over \u00a31.0 million over its three-year term.\n\u00b7\nDuring H1, we secured an additional \u00a323.6k in MRR through contract renewals and uplifts from existing customers.\n\u00b7\nProfessional services enhancing client value continue to gain traction, delivering \u00a30.17\u202fmillion to date\n.\n\u00b7\nQuarterly business reviews continue to enhance the customer experience, offering actionable insights that benefit our clients. This includes efforts to re-engage customers who had previously served notice to terminate their Mpro5 contracts.\n\u00b7\nOperationally, we have continued to successfully transition customers from our legacy APIs to the new Saturn (mobile app) and Odyssey (website) platforms, which offer a more intuitive interface and richer functionality, enhancing value for our clients.\nIn the next six months, we anticipate further Azure hosting savings from this migration.\nPost balance sheet events\n\u00b7\nSecured a significant mpro5 contract extension with one of the world's largest retailers, representing a total contract value of \u00a33.88 million over the three-year term\n, announced in November.\nWe have now renewed, over the last six months, contracts with four of our five largest clients. The fifth client is not due for renewal until late 2026.\nCurrent trading and prospects\nIn light of progress during H1 and subsequently, monthly recurring revenue (\"MRR\") as at 30 April 2026 is currently projected at \u00a3461k, an increase of 11% per cent since 31 October 2025. Our new-prospect pipeline is expanding, with a strong flow of promising opportunities.\nThe Board therefore continues to be optimistic for the outlook for Crimson Tide and we are seeing a positive impact from the implementation of our new strategy. We have aligned the cost base with the immediate requirements of the business and are making inroads into reducing churn and increasing the value of business with existing customers, as well as winning new customers from our growing pipeline of new opportunities.\nThe Board therefore remains of the view that the current financial year will reflect our re-establishing the foundations for growth in the subsequent years.\nJon Clarke\nCEO\nConsolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 31 October 2025, Crimson Tide returned to profitability.\nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position\nAs at 31 October 2025, the Company maintained a strong balance sheet with continued liquidity to support growth.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nAs at 31 October 2025, the Group's cash position remains stable and continues to support ongoing operations.\nNotes to the financial\n1. Basis of Preparation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 24 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted in the UK. They do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 30Th April 2025. Accounting policies are consistent with those applied in that report.\n2. Unaudited\nThese condensed interim financial statements are unaudited but have been prepared applying the same accounting policies used in the audited annual financial statements.\n3. Going Concern\nAfter reviewing forecast and cash flow projections, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n4. Segmental Information\nThe Group operates in one principal business segment, the provision of its Mpro5 Saas platform and associated professional services. The group has a presence in the UK, Ireland and the US.\nEnquiries:\nCrimson Tide plc\nChris Fielding, Non-Executive Chairman\nJon Clarke, Chief Executive Officer\nRachael Rowe, Finance Director\n+44 1892 542444\nAllenby Capital Limited - Nominated Adviser & Broker\nJeremy Porter / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nTony Quirke / David Johnson (Sales & Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Rachael Rowe, Finance Director of the Company.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
