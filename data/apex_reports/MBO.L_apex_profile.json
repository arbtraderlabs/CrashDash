OTR will be able to directly disburse funds into bKash e-wallet accounts for any remittance transactions facilitated in OTR's branches and through OTR's mobile application. This arrangement allows for real time disbursement into bKash e-wallet accounts. This new service offering, paired with MobilityOne's e-wallet services, MiPay, will enable wallet-to-wallet remittances for the Bangladesh corridor.\nThe Collaboration is in line with the Group's plans to digitalise OTR's range of services to enable faster and cost-efficient remittances to its users, particularly for foreign workers in Malaysia originating from Bangladesh, who are estimated to account for 37% of the foreign worker population in Malaysia. In this regard, according to data from Malaysia's Ministry of Human Resources, as of mid-2025, there were approximately 900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders registered in Malaysia, therefore supporting the strategy to digitalise OTR's range of services.\nBased on data published by the Central Bank of Malaysia, there has been a significant increase in e-remittance adoption in Malaysia, with over 40% of outward remittances completed digitally in 2024. It is with digital innovations and cross border collaborations such as this, that OTR plans to increase its market share in remittances by converting more customers from traditional cash-based remittances to e-remittance by providing faster and cost-efficient services.\nWhilst the Group is confident on the future prospects of the Collaboration, the Board currently expects any resultant revenues or earnings contribution to the Group in the next 12 months to be relatively modest.\n-ends-\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03\u00a089963600\nDato' Hussian A.

Following receipt of the conditional approval, the Group plans to explore further with potential strategic partners and investors for MBO Bank to meet the capital requirements and to fulfil all regulatory and operational conditions in the next year.\nThe intention for MBO Bank is to offer a full suite of offshore financial services\n, i\nncluding digital deposits, Islamic financing, cross-border\ncorporate and other digital banking\nsolutions\nunder the Labuan FSA regulatory framework to be\ndelivered through a Shariah-compliant platform\nto international clients\n.\nLabuan serves as an offshore financial centre, offering digital financial solutions for offshore entities and is currently actively promoting\nIslamic digital banking through specific regulations to capitalise on global trends\n.

The Board understands that the winding up petition relates to outstanding loans made by three private individuals to Hati in 2021 that remain unpaid. These loans relate to a period of time prior to Hati becoming an associate company of M1 Malaysia.\nOn 18 December 2025 the solicitors representing Hati filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal in Malaysia challenging the winding up order. In addition, Hati has instructed its solicitors to proceed with filing in the High Court in Malaysia a stay of execution of the winding up order pending the outcome of the appeal at the Court of Appeal in Malaysia.\nNotwithstanding the litigation, as set out above, the Board understands that Hati's operations remain unaffected at this current time.

The Group's flexible, scalable technology platform enables cash, debit card, and credit card transactions from multiple devices while providing robust control and monitoring of product and service distribution.\nFor more information, refer to our website at\nwww.mobilityone.com.my\nChairman's statement\nThe Group's revenue increased by 4.9% to \u00a3116.0 million for the first six months of 2025, compared to \u00a3110.5 million in the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily due to favourable exchange rates in H1 2025 in comparison to the corresponding period in 2024. However, when compared in Malaysian Ringgit, the Group's revenue for H1 2025 declined by 0.3%. This was mainly due to marginally reduced sales in the Group's core products and services in the main market in Malaysia, including mobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payment services through the Group's banking channels (mobile and internet banking). On the other hand, the sales through the Group's\nelectronic data capture terminals, payment gateway services and third parties' e-wallet applications as well as e-money services in Malaysia showed a promising improvement of more than 50% in H1 2025\n.\nThe Group reported a reduced loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million for the first half of 2025, compared to a loss after tax of \u00a31.68 million during the same period in 2024. This improvement was mainly attributed to a slight improvement of the overall gross profit margin, lower administrative expenses and the Group's share of a reduced loss from its 49%-owned associate company, Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd\n(\"\nSincere\n\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hati International Sdn Bhd (\"\nHati\n\"), a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia.\nThe Group's international remittance services in Malaysia\nexperienced higher transaction volumes, but\nthe contribution remains relatively modest. For the business in Brunei, w\nhile the Group is hopeful of its business growth, the operation represents an insignificant proportion of the Group's overall business. The Group has ceased exploring new business in the Philippines and has since discontinued its operations in the Philippines.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents (including fixed deposits classified under other financial assets) of approximately\n\u00a33.0 million\n(30 June 2024: cash and cash equivalents of \u00a34.41 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a36.94 million (30 June 2024: \u00a36.57 million)\nmainly due to higher finance costs and higher other operating expenses.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nThe Group's business activities continue to be predominately concentrated\nin Malaysia.\nMobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payments continued to be the main business activities for the Group.\nThe Group's international remittance business is expected to grow further. The Group's focus on retail electronic payments business, which covers both physical and online merchants, is also expected to grow steadily. The e-money businesses in Malaysia as well as the payment solution business in Brunei are expected to remain insignificant.\nThe Group's foray into the health technology industry via the Group's subsidiary MobilityOne Sdn Bhd (\"\nM1 Malaysia\n\") and its associated company (i.e, Hati), is gaining traction with Hati having secured several new projects with hospitals in Thailand and Malaysia,\nfocusing on implementing digital payment solutions to enhance patient billing and administrative processes as well as to integrate the Group's payment technologies to streamline healthcare services. These partnerships signify the Group's strategic move into the health technology industry, leveraging the Group's expertise in payment solutions to cater to the evolving needs of the healthcare industry. The Board of MobilityOne continue to be excited by the future prospects of Hati.\nThere are two major transactions pending completion, which are anticipated to have a material positive impact to the future financial performance of the Group:\n(1)\nDisposal of OneShop Retail Sdn Bhd (\"\n1Shop\n\") and proposed joint venture with Super Apps\nOn 19 October 2022,\nM1 Malaysia\nentered into a share sale agreement (the \"\nShare Sale Agreement\n\")\nwith Super Apps for the disposal by M1 Malaysia of a 60% shareholding in the Group's wholly-owned non-core subsidiary 1Shop to Super Apps (together the \"\nDisposal\n\"). Concurrently, M1 Malaysia entered into a joint-venture cum shareholders agreement with Super Apps and 1Shop (together the \"\nProposed Joint Venture\n\"). The intention of the Disposal and Proposed Joint Venture is to establish a new joint venture to expand the Group's e-products and services business initially in Malaysia.\nThe Disposal was initially subject to the completion of a merger exercise between Technology & Telecommunication Acquisition Corporation (\"\nTETE\n\") and Super Apps which includes certain approvals by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"\nSEC\n\") (together the \"\nMerger Exercise\n\")\n. Subsequently it was announced on 1 March 2024 that M1 Malaysia had entered into a supplementary agreement with Super Apps to amend the terms and conditions of the Share Sale Agreement in preparation for the Merger Exercise (the \"\nSupplementary Agreement\n\"). Under the new terms and conditions of the Supplementary Agreement, completion of the Disposal is no longer conditional on the Merger Exercise completing. In this regard, it was instead agreed that the Disposal completes upon entry of the Supplementary Agreement. Notwithstanding completion, if the Merger Exercise does not complete, M1 Malaysia is entitled to purchase back the 60% interest in 1Shop from Super Apps for a nominal consideration of RM1.00.\nIt was further agreed that, irrespective of the completion of the Disposal and subject to the completion of the Merger Exercise, Super Apps shall pay M1 Malaysia the following consideration:\n(a) RM40.0 million\n(c. \u00a36.84 million)\nin cash within 14 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise; and\n(b) RM20.0 million\n(c. \u00a33.42 million)\nin cash within 180 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Proposed Joint Venture, M1 Malaysia undertook to provide the necessary technical and business support to 1Shop and guaranteed that 1Shop will achieve revenues of at least RM560.0 million (equivalent to c. \u00a395.8 million) in the financial year ending 31 December 2023 or any other period as mutually agreed (the \"\nRevenue Target\n\"). As the Merger Exercise has been delayed, the period to achieve the Revenue Target shall be re-assessed and agreed with Super Apps in due course. In order to achieve the Revenue Target, Super Apps undertakes to provide all the necessary working capital requirements of 1Shop. This will be supplemented through Super Apps, in conjunction with 1Shop, collaborating with other organisations. Moreover, Super Apps shall procure TETE to issue shares in TETE (the \"\nTETE Shares\n\") to a stakeholder to be mutually agreed by M1 Malaysia and Super Apps with aggregate value of RM20.0 million (equivalent to c. \u00a33.42 million) within 14 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise. The issue price for the TETE Shares to the stakeholder will be determined at a later date. M1 Malaysia will only be entitled to receive the TETE Shares from the stakeholder following 1Shop achieving the Revenue Target.\nMost recently, on 27 August 2025, the Group announced that TETE had filed a Form 8-K report notifying that the deadline to complete the Merger Exercise was extended to 20 February 2026. Notwithstanding this, at this stage there can be no certainty that the Group will receive the consideration for the Disposal nor as to the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture. This is on the basis that both events are conditional on the completion of the Merger Exercise, which is outside of the Group's control.\nThe payment for the consideration of the Disposal and the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture\nwill represent a positive material financial development for the Group. Consequently though, any further delays to the Merger Exercise or the non-completion of the Merger Exercise itself will impact the Group's future financial position and business operations, including restricting the Group's future growth initiatives.\nTete Technologies Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TETE, has also filed a draft proxy statement (\"\nTETE Proxy Filing\n\") with the SEC and the TETE Proxy Filing is subject to the approval by the SEC. The Company will release further announcements as and when appropriate.\n(2)\nAcquisition of Hati via Sincere\nOn 29 September 2023, M1 Malaysia entered into a share sale agreement with United Flagship Development Sdn Bhd (\"\nVendor\n\") to acquire a 49% equity interest in Sincere for a total cash consideration of RM30.0 million (c. \u00a35.217 million) to be paid to the Vendor in two tranches. On 4 October 2023, the acquisition of Hati via Sincere completed and the first tranche, representing RM2.0 million (c. \u00a30.348 million), has since been paid to the Vendor. The second tranche, representing the balance of RM28.0 million (c. \u00a34.869 million) (the \"\nSecond Tranche\n\"), was originally required to be paid by M1 Malaysia by 8 March 2024 (the \"\nSecond Tranche Payment Date\n\").\nThe Second Tranche Payment Date has been subject to prior extensions and was most recently extended to 30 November 2025. Any payment in relation to the Second Tranche made after the Second Tranche Payment Date is subject to an interest charge of 10% per annum.\nAs part of the Group's business plans, the Group has\nidentified the following business areas for future growth:\n(1)\nElectronic payment system\nThe Group is actively expanding its merchant acquiring business across both online and offline channels.\nC\nollaborations with local banks have been established to enhance merchant onboarding and payment acceptance capabilities, aligning with Malaysia's broader shift towards digital payments.\nInternationally, the Group has secured regulatory approval from Brunei's central bank to operate a merchant acquiring business in Brunei.\nWith most of the Bruneians engaging in e-commerce activities such as shopping, banking, and bill payments\n,\nthe Group is well-positioned to tap into this growing market upon receiving final operational clearance.\n(2)\neMoney business\nThe Group's e-money business is expected to grow through collaborations and technological advancements.\nT\nhe Group is actively working on expanding its white-label collaborations to broaden the user base and is developing capabilities to facilitate regional acceptance of the Group's e-money services.\nInternationally, the Group has secured an e-money license from Brunei's central bank and plans to launch the services in Brunei by the end of 2025, subject to fulfilling the conditions set forth by the regulator.\n(3)\nMoney transfer business\nThe Group expects further growth in the money transfer business with such growth expected to be fuelled by strategic partnerships and market diversification.\nWhile development using SWIFT network is still underway, new\ncollaborations with bKash (i.e, the biggest mobile financial services provider in Bangladesh) and Mastercard Send, which is expected to go live in the next few months, will enhance the Group's product offerings, enabling faster and more secure cross-border transactions.\nAdditionally, the Group has initiated incoming remittance services to Somalia, tapping into underserved markets and broadening its global reach.\nThese initiatives are expected to drive revenue growth.\n(4)\nHealth technology initiatives\nThe Group's venture into the health technology sector is expected to yield promising developments for the Group in the long run, with a hospital project in Thailand as well as the Hospital Information System (HIS) implementations at several hospitals in Malaysia.\nThese initiatives align with Malaysia's broader digital health transformation strategy\n.\nCurrently, most of the health clinics in Malaysia do not have digital health records, highlighting the significant growth potential in this sector\n.\nThe Malaysian government's phased implementation of digital health initiatives aims to fully digitalise half of government health clinics by 2030, presenting substantial opportunities for health technology providers.\nThe Group's involvement in these pioneering projects is expected to allow the Group to expand its health technology business in Malaysia.\nThe Group anticipates a challenging business environment and remains cautious about the outlook for the remainder of 2025. T\nhe Group's potential collaboration with TETE continues with the relevant parties working towards a\nMerger Exercise deadline of 20 February 2026\n.\nNotwithstanding this, at this stage there can be no certainty that the Group will receive\nthe consideration for the Disposal nor as to the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture. This is on the basis that both events are conditional on the completion of the Merger Exercise, which is outside of the Group's control. The payment for the consideration of the Disposal and the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture will represent a positive and material financial development for the Group. However, any further delays to the Merger Exercise and/or the non-completion of the Merger Exercise itself will impact the Group's future financial position and business operations, including restricting the Group's\nfuture growth initiatives.\nFurthermore, while the health technology business shows strong promise, it also faces notable challenges, particularly rising manpower costs, increased competition from regional players, and the need for Hati to carefully manage its project pipeline to avoid overcommitment and to maintain service quality and post\u2011implementation support excellence.\nNotwithstanding the challenges ahead, the Group remains excited about the future prospects of the Group and looks forward to the TETE transaction closing so that the Board can look to progress initiatives across both its core business in Malaysia and at Hati.\nAbu Bakar bin Mohd Taib (Chairman)\n26 September 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nSix months\nSix months\nFinancial year\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n115,956,978\n110,488,003\n230,227,323\nCost of sales\n(110,368,404)\n(105,464,057)\n(219,123,512)\nGROSS PROFIT\n5,588,574\n5,023,946\n11,103,811\nOther operating income\n15,741\n10,625\n55,303\nAdministration expenses\n(6,113,592)\n(6,247,169)\n(13,395,599)\nOther operating expenses\n(187,038)\n(162,877)\n(192,677)\nNet loss on financial instruments\n-\n-\n(172,190)\nOPERATING LOSS\n(696,314)\n(1,375,475)\n(2,601,352)\nFinance income\n12,746\n14,191\n46,246\nFinance costs\n(204,038)\n(157,203)\n(357,380)\nShare of post-tax loss of equity accounted\nassociates\n(113,905)\n(157,630)\n(584,896)\nLOSS BEFORE TAX\n(1,001,512)\n(1,676,117)\n(3,497,382)\nTax\n(139,146)\n(416)\n50,762\nLOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,620)\nGain on disposal of subsidiary\n-\n-\n34\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,586)\nAttributable to:\nOwners of the parent\n(1,138,860)\n(1,672,674)\n(3,446,067)\nNon-controlling interest\n(1,798)\n(3,859)\n(519)\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,586)\nLOSS PER SHARE\nBasic (loss) / earnings per share (pence)\n(1.071)\n(1.574)\n(3.242)\nDiluted (loss) / earnings per share (pence)\n-\n(1.574)\n(3.242)\nLOSS\nFOR THE PERIOD/YEAR\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,586)\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS)/ PROFIT\nForeign currency translation\n(196)\n(41,786)\n68,333\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR\nTHE PERIOD/YEAR\n(1,140,854)\n(1,718,319)\n(3,378,253)\nTotal comprehensive loss attributable to:\nOwners of the parent\n(1,139,465)\n(1,714,710)\n(3,377,170)\nNon-controlling interest\n(1,389)\n(3,609)\n(1,083)\n(1,140,854)\n(1,718,319)\n(3,378,253)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 30 JUNE 2025\nAt\nAt\nAt\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n510,410\n543,664\n563,157\nProperty, plant and equipment\n395,491\n435,320\n469,344\nInvestment property\n244,062\n242,208\n253,879\nRight-of-use assets\n217,078\n177,821\n281,179\nTrade and other receivables\n225,237\n889,800\n203,139\nInvestment in associate\n4,413,410\n4,754,604\n4,606,344\nOther investment\n11,264\n10,899\n11,569\n6,016,952\n7,054,316\n6,388,611\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n791,848\n1,495,795\n1,286,853\nTrade and other receivables\n5,376,599\n2,572,590\n4,715,886\nOther financial assets\n512,924\n474,032\n520,399\nTax recoverable\n28,331\n160,267\n174,895\nCash and cash equivalents\n2,484,317\n3,938,017\n3,979,183\n9,194,019\n8,640,701\n10,677,216\nTotal Assets\n15,210,971\n15,695,017\n17,065,827\nShareholders' equity\nEquity attributable to owners of the parent:\nCalled up share capital\n2,657,470\n2,657,470\n2,657,470\nShare premium\n909,472\n909,472\n909,472\nReverse acquisition reserve\n708,951\n708,951\n708,951\nForeign currency translation reserve\n571,879\n462,115\n572,484\nAccumulated losses\n(6,087,175)\n(3,174,922)\n(4,948,315)\nShareholders' equity\n(1,239,403)\n1,563,086\n(99,938)\nNon-controlling interest\n(15,806)\n(16,943)\n(14,417)\nTotal Equity\n(1,255,209)\n1,546,143\n(114,355)\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nLoans and borrowings -

It has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" and does not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements\n.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.\nFull details of the accounting policies adopted, which are consistent with those disclosed in the Company's 2024 Annual Report, will be included in the audited financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2025.\n2.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position include financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 30 June 2025.\n3.\nNature of financial information\nThe unaudited interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 does not constitute statutory accounts under the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2024 are extracted from the audited statutory financial statements.\nFull audited financial statements of the Group in respect of that financial year prepared in accordance with IFRS, which we received an unqualified audit opinion, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\n4.\nFunctional and presentation currency\n(i) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The functional currency of the Group is Ringgit Malaysia (RM). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pound Sterling (\u00a3), which is the Company's presentational currency as this is the currency used in the country in which the entity is listed.\nAssets and liabilities are translated into Pound Sterling (\u00a3) at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. Results and cash flows are translated into Pound Sterling (\u00a3) using average rates of exchange for the period.\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year/period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\nThe financial information set out below has been translated at the following rates:\nExchange rate (RM: \u00a3)\nAt Statement of Financial Position date\nAverage for year/\nPeriod\nPeriod ended 30 June 2025\n5.77\n5.68\nPeriod ended 30 June 2024\n5.96\n5.98\nYear ended 31 December 2024\n5.62\n5.84\n5.\nSegmental analysis\nThe Group has two operating segments as follows:\n(a) Telecommunication services and electronic commerce solutions; and\n(b) Hardware and services, including\nselling of hardware, remittance services and money lending income.\nNo segmental analysis of assets and capital expenditure are presented as they are mostly unallocated items which comprise corporate assets and liabilities.

Current tax is the expected amount of taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial period and is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.\nDeferred tax is recognised on the liability method for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Statement of Financial Position and its tax base at the Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date and is reduced to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available.\nDeferred tax is recognised in the income statement, except when it arises from a transaction which is recognised directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly in equity, or when it arises from a business combination that is an acquisition, in which case the deferred tax is included in the resulting goodwill or negative goodwill.\n7.\nLoss per share\nThe basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss in the six month period ended 30 June 2025 of \u00a3\n1,138,860\n(30 June 2024: \u00a3\n1,672,674\nand year ended 31 December 2024: \u00a33,446,067) attributable to owners of the parent by the number of ordinary shares outstanding at 30 June 2025 of 106,298,780 (30 June 2024: 106,298,780 and 31 December 2024: 106,298,780).\nThere is no diluted earnings per share for the six month period ended 30 June 2025 as there were no\noutstanding dilutive share options during the period, which had expired on 4 December 2024.\n8.\nReconciliation of profit before tax to cash generated from operations\nSix months\nSix months\nFinancial year\nended\nEnded\nended\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flow used in operating activities\nLoss before tax\n(1,001,512)\n(1,676,117)\n(3,497,382)\nAdjustments for:\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n38,508\n13,060\n26,741\nAmortisation of right-of-use assets\n57,604\n42,645\n107,414\nBad debt written off\n-\n-\n2,373\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n87,754\n104,160\n193,939\nDepreciation of investment property\n3,172\n3,012\n6,168\nGain on disposal of property, plant & equipment\n(430)\n-\n(25,394)\nGain on termination of right-of-use assets\n-\n-\n(59)\nImpairment loss on trade receivables\n-\n-\n607,173\nGain on disposal of subsidiary\n-\n-\n(34)\nInterest expenses\n203,746\n156,660\n357,380\nInterest income\n(12,746)\n(13,915)\n(46,246)\nProperty, plant and equipment written off\n-\n45\n115\nReversal on impairment loss on trade receivable\n-\n-\n(434,983)\nShare of post-tax loss of equity accounted associates\n109,634\n157,630\n584,896\nUnrealised loss/(gain) on forex\n-\n-\n(3,253)\nOperating loss before working capital changes\n(514,270)\n(1,212,820)\n(2,121,152)\nDecrease in inventories\n461,065\n379,613\n625,822\nIncrease in receivables\n(838,428)\n(588,199)\n(2,146,882)\nIncrease in amount due to directors & shareholder\n468\n23,000\n16,532\n(Decrease)/Increase in payables\n(263,671)\n(520,412)\n1,815,888\nCash used in operations\n(1,154,836)\n(1,918,818)\n(1,809,792)\n9.\nContingent liabilities\nIn the period under review, corporate guarantees of RM44.1 million (\u00a37.64 million) (H1 2024: RM29.1 million (\u00a34.88 million)) were given to a licensed bank by the Company for credit facilities granted to a subsidiary company.\n10.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared applying the same accounting policies that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 except for the adoption of new and amended reporting standards, which are effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2025. Various amendments to standards and interpretations of standards are effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2025 as detailed in the 2024 Annual Report, none of which have any impact on reported results.\nAmortisation of intangible assets\nSoftware is amortised over its estimated useful life. Management estimated the useful life of this asset to be within 10 years. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development could impact the economic useful life therefore future amortisation could be revised.\nThe Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash generating units (\"CGU\") to which goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimation of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\nThe research and development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life span of the developed assets. Management estimated the useful life of these assets to be within 5 years. Changes in the technological developments could impact the economic useful life and the residual values of these assets, therefore future amortisation charges could be revised.\nImpairment of goodwill on consolidation\nThe Group's cash flow projections include estimates of sales. However, if the projected sales do not materialise there is a risk that the value of goodwill would be impaired.\nThe Directors have carried out a detailed impairment review in respect of goodwill. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, by considering cash flows forecasts. The cash flow projections are based on the assumption that the Group can realise projected sales. A prudent approach has been applied with no residual value being factored. At the period end, based on these assumptions there was no indication of impairment of the value of goodwill or of development costs.\nResearch and development costs\nAll research costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.\nExpenditure incurred on projects to develop new products is capitalised and deferred only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the project and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the development. Product development expenditures which do not meet these criteria are expensed when incurred.\nDevelopment costs, considered to have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less any impairment losses and are amortised through other operating expenses in the income statement using the straight-line basis over the commercial lives of the underlying products not exceeding 5 years. Impairment is assessed whenever there is an indication of impairment and the amortisation period and method are also reviewed at least at each Statement of Financial Position date.\n11.\nDividends\nThe Company has not proposed or declared an interim dividend.\n12.\nInterim report\nThis interim financial statement will, in accordance with Rule 26 of the AIM Rules for Companies, be available shortly on the Company's website at\nwww.mobilityone.com.my\n.\n-Ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
