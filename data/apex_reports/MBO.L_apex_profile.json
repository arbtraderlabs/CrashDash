The purpose of the TETE Proxy Filing is to provide TETE shareholders with information on the proposals ahead of seeking approval from TETE shareholders for the Merger Exercise itself. An extraordinary general meeting will be convened in due course for this purpose by TETE once the TETE Proxy Filing is in complete form and approved by the SEC.\nAs previously announced by the Company on 19 October 2022, the payment of the consideration to MobilityOne in relation to the terms of the Proposed Disposal is subject to the completion of the Merger Exercise and such consideration payments will be dependent on timings for completion of the Merger Exercise.\nThe Company will release further announcements as and when appropriate.\nPart of the text of the TETE Proxy Filing is set out below:\n\"\nTETE has entered into an amended and restated agreement and plan of merger, dated as of August 2, 2023 (as it may be amended from time to time, the \"\nMerger Agreement\n\" or \"\nBusiness Combination Agreement\n\"), which provides for a Business Combination between TETE and Bradbury Capital Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company (\"\nHoldings\n\"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be effected in two steps: (i) TETE will reincorporate in the Cayman Islands by merging with and into TETE TECHNOLOGIES INC, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TETE (\"\nPubCo\n\"), with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the \"\nReincorporation Merger\n\"); (ii) after the Reincorporation Merger, TETE INTERNATIONAL INC (\"\nMerger Sub\n\"), a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, will be merged with and into Holdings, resulting in Holdings being a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (the \"\nAcquisition Merger\n\"). The Merger Agreement is by and among TETE, PubCo, Merger Sub, Holdings, Super Apps Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings, Technology & Telecommunication LLC, as the representative of the shareholders of TETE, and Loo See Yuen, an individual as the representative of the shareholders of Holdings.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Acquisition Merger is $1,100,000,000, payable in the form of 110,000,000 newly issued PubCo Ordinary Shares (the \"Closing Payment Shares\") valued at $10.00 per share, of which $235,000,000 shall be paid at Closing with the remaining $865,000,000 payable subject to the earn-out provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to Holdings and its shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Acquisition Merger, the issued and outstanding shares in Holdings held by the former Holdings shareholders will be cancelled and cease to exist, in exchange for the issuance of the Closing Payment Shares, 10% of which are to be issued and held in escrow to satisfy any indemnification obligations incurred under the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Acquisition Merger, the one fully paid share in Merger Sub held by PubCo will become one fully paid share in the surviving corporation, so that Holdings will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo. Holders of TETE ordinary shares will be asked to approve, among other things, the Merger Agreement and the other related Proposals. The combined company, i.e. the surviving entity of the Reincorporation Merger, after the Business Combination is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus/prospectus as the \"Combined Company\n.\"\nUnless otherwise defined herein, the capitalised defined terms used in this announcement have the same meaning as those used in the Company's announcement on 19 October 2022.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03 89963600\nDato' Hussian A.
