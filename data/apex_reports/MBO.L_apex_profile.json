OTR will be able to directly disburse funds into bKash e-wallet accounts for any remittance transactions facilitated in OTR's branches and through OTR's mobile application. This arrangement allows for real time disbursement into bKash e-wallet accounts. This new service offering, paired with MobilityOne's e-wallet services, MiPay, will enable wallet-to-wallet remittances for the Bangladesh corridor.\nThe Collaboration is in line with the Group's plans to digitalise OTR's range of services to enable faster and cost-efficient remittances to its users, particularly for foreign workers in Malaysia originating from Bangladesh, who are estimated to account for 37% of the foreign worker population in Malaysia. In this regard, according to data from Malaysia's Ministry of Human Resources, as of mid-2025, there were approximately 900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders registered in Malaysia, therefore supporting the strategy to digitalise OTR's range of services.\nBased on data published by the Central Bank of Malaysia, there has been a significant increase in e-remittance adoption in Malaysia, with over 40% of outward remittances completed digitally in 2024. It is with digital innovations and cross border collaborations such as this, that OTR plans to increase its market share in remittances by converting more customers from traditional cash-based remittances to e-remittance by providing faster and cost-efficient services.\nWhilst the Group is confident on the future prospects of the Collaboration, the Board currently expects any resultant revenues or earnings contribution to the Group in the next 12 months to be relatively modest.\n-ends-\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03\u00a089963600\nDato' Hussian A.

The Group's flexible, scalable technology platform enables cash, debit card, and credit card transactions from multiple devices while providing robust control and monitoring of product and service distribution.\nFor more information, refer to our website at\nwww.mobilityone.com.my\nChairman's statement\nThe Group's revenue increased by 4.9% to \u00a3116.0 million for the first six months of 2025, compared to \u00a3110.5 million in the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily due to favourable exchange rates in H1 2025 in comparison to the corresponding period in 2024. However, when compared in Malaysian Ringgit, the Group's revenue for H1 2025 declined by 0.3%. This was mainly due to marginally reduced sales in the Group's core products and services in the main market in Malaysia, including mobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payment services through the Group's banking channels (mobile and internet banking). On the other hand, the sales through the Group's\nelectronic data capture terminals, payment gateway services and third parties' e-wallet applications as well as e-money services in Malaysia showed a promising improvement of more than 50% in H1 2025\n.\nThe Group reported a reduced loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million for the first half of 2025, compared to a loss after tax of \u00a31.68 million during the same period in 2024. This improvement was mainly attributed to a slight improvement of the overall gross profit margin, lower administrative expenses and the Group's share of a reduced loss from its 49%-owned associate company, Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd\n(\"\nSincere\n\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hati International Sdn Bhd (\"\nHati\n\"), a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia.\nThe Group's international remittance services in Malaysia\nexperienced higher transaction volumes, but\nthe contribution remains relatively modest. For the business in Brunei, w\nhile the Group is hopeful of its business growth, the operation represents an insignificant proportion of the Group's overall business. The Group has ceased exploring new business in the Philippines and has since discontinued its operations in the Philippines.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents (including fixed deposits classified under other financial assets) of approximately\n\u00a33.0 million\n(30 June 2024: cash and cash equivalents of \u00a34.41 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a36.94 million (30 June 2024: \u00a36.57 million)\nmainly due to higher finance costs and higher other operating expenses.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nThe Group's business activities continue to be predominately concentrated\nin Malaysia.\nMobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payments continued to be the main business activities for the Group.\nThe Group's international remittance business is expected to grow further. The Group's focus on retail electronic payments business, which covers both physical and online merchants, is also expected to grow steadily. The e-money businesses in Malaysia as well as the payment solution business in Brunei are expected to remain insignificant.\nThe Group's foray into the health technology industry via the Group's subsidiary MobilityOne Sdn Bhd (\"\nM1 Malaysia\n\") and its associated company (i.e, Hati), is gaining traction with Hati having secured several new projects with hospitals in Thailand and Malaysia,\nfocusing on implementing digital payment solutions to enhance patient billing and administrative processes as well as to integrate the Group's payment technologies to streamline healthcare services. These partnerships signify the Group's strategic move into the health technology industry, leveraging the Group's expertise in payment solutions to cater to the evolving needs of the healthcare industry. The Board of MobilityOne continue to be excited by the future prospects of Hati.\nThere are two major transactions pending completion, which are anticipated to have a material positive impact to the future financial performance of the Group:\n(1)\nDisposal of OneShop Retail Sdn Bhd (\"\n1Shop\n\") and proposed joint venture with Super Apps\nOn 19 October 2022,\nM1 Malaysia\nentered into a share sale agreement (the \"\nShare Sale Agreement\n\")\nwith Super Apps for the disposal by M1 Malaysia of a 60% shareholding in the Group's wholly-owned non-core subsidiary 1Shop to Super Apps (together the \"\nDisposal\n\"). Concurrently, M1 Malaysia entered into a joint-venture cum shareholders agreement with Super Apps and 1Shop (together the \"\nProposed Joint Venture\n\"). The intention of the Disposal and Proposed Joint Venture is to establish a new joint venture to expand the Group's e-products and services business initially in Malaysia.\nThe Disposal was initially subject to the completion of a merger exercise between Technology & Telecommunication Acquisition Corporation (\"\nTETE\n\") and Super Apps which includes certain approvals by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"\nSEC\n\") (together the \"\nMerger Exercise\n\")\n. Subsequently it was announced on 1 March 2024 that M1 Malaysia had entered into a supplementary agreement with Super Apps to amend the terms and conditions of the Share Sale Agreement in preparation for the Merger Exercise (the \"\nSupplementary Agreement\n\"). Under the new terms and conditions of the Supplementary Agreement, completion of the Disposal is no longer conditional on the Merger Exercise completing. In this regard, it was instead agreed that the Disposal completes upon entry of the Supplementary Agreement. Notwithstanding completion, if the Merger Exercise does not complete, M1 Malaysia is entitled to purchase back the 60% interest in 1Shop from Super Apps for a nominal consideration of RM1.00.\nIt was further agreed that, irrespective of the completion of the Disposal and subject to the completion of the Merger Exercise, Super Apps shall pay M1 Malaysia the following consideration:\n(a) RM40.0 million\n(c. \u00a36.84 million)\nin cash within 14 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise; and\n(b) RM20.0 million\n(c. \u00a33.42 million)\nin cash within 180 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Proposed Joint Venture, M1 Malaysia undertook to provide the necessary technical and business support to 1Shop and guaranteed that 1Shop will achieve revenues of at least RM560.0 million (equivalent to c. \u00a395.8 million) in the financial year ending 31 December 2023 or any other period as mutually agreed (the \"\nRevenue Target\n\"). As the Merger Exercise has been delayed, the period to achieve the Revenue Target shall be re-assessed and agreed with Super Apps in due course. In order to achieve the Revenue Target, Super Apps undertakes to provide all the necessary working capital requirements of 1Shop. This will be supplemented through Super Apps, in conjunction with 1Shop, collaborating with other organisations. Moreover, Super Apps shall procure TETE to issue shares in TETE (the \"\nTETE Shares\n\") to a stakeholder to be mutually agreed by M1 Malaysia and Super Apps with aggregate value of RM20.0 million (equivalent to c. \u00a33.42 million) within 14 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise. The issue price for the TETE Shares to the stakeholder will be determined at a later date. M1 Malaysia will only be entitled to receive the TETE Shares from the stakeholder following 1Shop achieving the Revenue Target.\nMost recently, on 27 August 2025, the Group announced that TETE had filed a Form 8-K report notifying that the deadline to complete the Merger Exercise was extended to 20 February 2026. Notwithstanding this, at this stage there can be no certainty that the Group will receive the consideration for the Disposal nor as to the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture. This is on the basis that both events are conditional on the completion of the Merger Exercise, which is outside of the Group's control.\nThe payment for the consideration of the Disposal and the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture\nwill represent a positive material financial development for the Group. Consequently though, any further delays to the Merger Exercise or the non-completion of the Merger Exercise itself will impact the Group's future financial position and business operations, including restricting the Group's future growth initiatives.\nTete Technologies Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TETE, has also filed a draft proxy statement (\"\nTETE Proxy Filing\n\") with the SEC and the TETE Proxy Filing is subject to the approval by the SEC. The Company will release further announcements as and when appropriate.\n(2)\nAcquisition of Hati via Sincere\nOn 29 September 2023, M1 Malaysia entered into a share sale agreement with United Flagship Development Sdn Bhd (\"\nVendor\n\") to acquire a 49% equity interest in Sincere for a total cash consideration of RM30.0 million (c. \u00a35.217 million) to be paid to the Vendor in two tranches. On 4 October 2023, the acquisition of Hati via Sincere completed and the first tranche, representing RM2.0 million (c. \u00a30.348 million), has since been paid to the Vendor. The second tranche, representing the balance of RM28.0 million (c. \u00a34.869 million) (the \"\nSecond Tranche\n\"), was originally required to be paid by M1 Malaysia by 8 March 2024 (the \"\nSecond Tranche Payment Date\n\").\nThe Second Tranche Payment Date has been subject to prior extensions and was most recently extended to 30 November 2025. Any payment in relation to the Second Tranche made after the Second Tranche Payment Date is subject to an interest charge of 10% per annum.\nAs part of the Group's business plans, the Group has\nidentified the following business areas for future growth:\n(1)\nElectronic payment system\nThe Group is actively expanding its merchant acquiring business across both online and offline channels.\nC\nollaborations with local banks have been established to enhance merchant onboarding and payment acceptance capabilities, aligning with Malaysia's broader shift towards digital payments.\nInternationally, the Group has secured regulatory approval from Brunei's central bank to operate a merchant acquiring business in Brunei.\nWith most of the Bruneians engaging in e-commerce activities such as shopping, banking, and bill payments\n,\nthe Group is well-positioned to tap into this growing market upon receiving final operational clearance.\n(2)\neMoney business\nThe Group's e-money business is expected to grow through collaborations and technological advancements.\nT\nhe Group is actively working on expanding its white-label collaborations to broaden the user base and is developing capabilities to facilitate regional acceptance of the Group's e-money services.\nInternationally, the Group has secured an e-money license from Brunei's central bank and plans to launch the services in Brunei by the end of 2025, subject to fulfilling the conditions set forth by the regulator.\n(3)\nMoney transfer business\nThe Group expects further growth in the money transfer business with such growth expected to be fuelled by strategic partnerships and market diversification.\nWhile development using SWIFT network is still underway, new\ncollaborations with bKash (i.e, the biggest mobile financial services provider in Bangladesh) and Mastercard Send, which is expected to go live in the next few months, will enhance the Group's product offerings, enabling faster and more secure cross-border transactions.\nAdditionally, the Group has initiated incoming remittance services to Somalia, tapping into underserved markets and broadening its global reach.\nThese initiatives are expected to drive revenue growth.\n(4)\nHealth technology initiatives\nThe Group's venture into the health technology sector is expected to yield promising developments for the Group in the long run, with a hospital project in Thailand as well as the Hospital Information System (HIS) implementations at several hospitals in Malaysia.\nThese initiatives align with Malaysia's broader digital health transformation strategy\n.\nCurrently, most of the health clinics in Malaysia do not have digital health records, highlighting the significant growth potential in this sector\n.\nThe Malaysian government's phased implementation of digital health initiatives aims to fully digitalise half of government health clinics by 2030, presenting substantial opportunities for health technology providers.\nThe Group's involvement in these pioneering projects is expected to allow the Group to expand its health technology business in Malaysia.\nThe Group anticipates a challenging business environment and remains cautious about the outlook for the remainder of 2025. T\nhe Group's potential collaboration with TETE continues with the relevant parties working towards a\nMerger Exercise deadline of 20 February 2026\n.\nNotwithstanding this, at this stage there can be no certainty that the Group will receive\nthe consideration for the Disposal nor as to the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture. This is on the basis that both events are conditional on the completion of the Merger Exercise, which is outside of the Group's control. The payment for the consideration of the Disposal and the completion of the Proposed Joint Venture will represent a positive and material financial development for the Group. However, any further delays to the Merger Exercise and/or the non-completion of the Merger Exercise itself will impact the Group's future financial position and business operations, including restricting the Group's\nfuture growth initiatives.\nFurthermore, while the health technology business shows strong promise, it also faces notable challenges, particularly rising manpower costs, increased competition from regional players, and the need for Hati to carefully manage its project pipeline to avoid overcommitment and to maintain service quality and post\u2011implementation support excellence.\nNotwithstanding the challenges ahead, the Group remains excited about the future prospects of the Group and looks forward to the TETE transaction closing so that the Board can look to progress initiatives across both its core business in Malaysia and at Hati.\nAbu Bakar bin Mohd Taib (Chairman)\n26 September 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nSix months\nSix months\nFinancial year\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n115,956,978\n110,488,003\n230,227,323\nCost of sales\n(110,368,404)\n(105,464,057)\n(219,123,512)\nGROSS PROFIT\n5,588,574\n5,023,946\n11,103,811\nOther operating income\n15,741\n10,625\n55,303\nAdministration expenses\n(6,113,592)\n(6,247,169)\n(13,395,599)\nOther operating expenses\n(187,038)\n(162,877)\n(192,677)\nNet loss on financial instruments\n-\n-\n(172,190)\nOPERATING LOSS\n(696,314)\n(1,375,475)\n(2,601,352)\nFinance income\n12,746\n14,191\n46,246\nFinance costs\n(204,038)\n(157,203)\n(357,380)\nShare of post-tax loss of equity accounted\nassociates\n(113,905)\n(157,630)\n(584,896)\nLOSS BEFORE TAX\n(1,001,512)\n(1,676,117)\n(3,497,382)\nTax\n(139,146)\n(416)\n50,762\nLOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,620)\nGain on disposal of subsidiary\n-\n-\n34\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,586)\nAttributable to:\nOwners of the parent\n(1,138,860)\n(1,672,674)\n(3,446,067)\nNon-controlling interest\n(1,798)\n(3,859)\n(519)\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,586)\nLOSS PER SHARE\nBasic (loss) / earnings per share (pence)\n(1.071)\n(1.574)\n(3.242)\nDiluted (loss) / earnings per share (pence)\n-\n(1.574)\n(3.242)\nLOSS\nFOR THE PERIOD/YEAR\n(1,140,658)\n(1,676,533)\n(3,446,586)\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS)/ PROFIT\nForeign currency translation\n(196)\n(41,786)\n68,333\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR\nTHE PERIOD/YEAR\n(1,140,854)\n(1,718,319)\n(3,378,253)\nTotal comprehensive loss attributable to:\nOwners of the parent\n(1,139,465)\n(1,714,710)\n(3,377,170)\nNon-controlling interest\n(1,389)\n(3,609)\n(1,083)\n(1,140,854)\n(1,718,319)\n(3,378,253)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 30 JUNE 2025\nAt\nAt\nAt\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n510,410\n543,664\n563,157\nProperty, plant and equipment\n395,491\n435,320\n469,344\nInvestment property\n244,062\n242,208\n253,879\nRight-of-use assets\n217,078\n177,821\n281,179\nTrade and other receivables\n225,237\n889,800\n203,139\nInvestment in associate\n4,413,410\n4,754,604\n4,606,344\nOther investment\n11,264\n10,899\n11,569\n6,016,952\n7,054,316\n6,388,611\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n791,848\n1,495,795\n1,286,853\nTrade and other receivables\n5,376,599\n2,572,590\n4,715,886\nOther financial assets\n512,924\n474,032\n520,399\nTax recoverable\n28,331\n160,267\n174,895\nCash and cash equivalents\n2,484,317\n3,938,017\n3,979,183\n9,194,019\n8,640,701\n10,677,216\nTotal Assets\n15,210,971\n15,695,017\n17,065,827\nShareholders' equity\nEquity attributable to owners of the parent:\nCalled up share capital\n2,657,470\n2,657,470\n2,657,470\nShare premium\n909,472\n909,472\n909,472\nReverse acquisition reserve\n708,951\n708,951\n708,951\nForeign currency translation reserve\n571,879\n462,115\n572,484\nAccumulated losses\n(6,087,175)\n(3,174,922)\n(4,948,315)\nShareholders' equity\n(1,239,403)\n1,563,086\n(99,938)\nNon-controlling interest\n(15,806)\n(16,943)\n(14,417)\nTotal Equity\n(1,255,209)\n1,546,143\n(114,355)\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nLoans and borrowings -

It has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" and does not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements\n.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.\nFull details of the accounting policies adopted, which are consistent with those disclosed in the Company's 2024 Annual Report, will be included in the audited financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2025.\n2.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position include financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 30 June 2025.\n3.\nNature of financial information\nThe unaudited interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 does not constitute statutory accounts under the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2024 are extracted from the audited statutory financial statements.\nFull audited financial statements of the Group in respect of that financial year prepared in accordance with IFRS, which we received an unqualified audit opinion, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\n4.\nFunctional and presentation currency\n(i) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The functional currency of the Group is Ringgit Malaysia (RM). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pound Sterling (\u00a3), which is the Company's presentational currency as this is the currency used in the country in which the entity is listed.\nAssets and liabilities are translated into Pound Sterling (\u00a3) at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. Results and cash flows are translated into Pound Sterling (\u00a3) using average rates of exchange for the period.\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year/period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.\nThe financial information set out below has been translated at the following rates:\nExchange rate (RM: \u00a3)\nAt Statement of Financial Position date\nAverage for year/\nPeriod\nPeriod ended 30 June 2025\n5.77\n5.68\nPeriod ended 30 June 2024\n5.96\n5.98\nYear ended 31 December 2024\n5.62\n5.84\n5.\nSegmental analysis\nThe Group has two operating segments as follows:\n(a) Telecommunication services and electronic commerce solutions; and\n(b) Hardware and services, including\nselling of hardware, remittance services and money lending income.\nNo segmental analysis of assets and capital expenditure are presented as they are mostly unallocated items which comprise corporate assets and liabilities.

Current tax is the expected amount of taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial period and is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.\nDeferred tax is recognised on the liability method for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Statement of Financial Position and its tax base at the Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date and is reduced to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available.\nDeferred tax is recognised in the income statement, except when it arises from a transaction which is recognised directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly in equity, or when it arises from a business combination that is an acquisition, in which case the deferred tax is included in the resulting goodwill or negative goodwill.\n7.\nLoss per share\nThe basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss in the six month period ended 30 June 2025 of \u00a3\n1,138,860\n(30 June 2024: \u00a3\n1,672,674\nand year ended 31 December 2024: \u00a33,446,067) attributable to owners of the parent by the number of ordinary shares outstanding at 30 June 2025 of 106,298,780 (30 June 2024: 106,298,780 and 31 December 2024: 106,298,780).\nThere is no diluted earnings per share for the six month period ended 30 June 2025 as there were no\noutstanding dilutive share options during the period, which had expired on 4 December 2024.\n8.\nReconciliation of profit before tax to cash generated from operations\nSix months\nSix months\nFinancial year\nended\nEnded\nended\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 Dec 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flow used in operating activities\nLoss before tax\n(1,001,512)\n(1,676,117)\n(3,497,382)\nAdjustments for:\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n38,508\n13,060\n26,741\nAmortisation of right-of-use assets\n57,604\n42,645\n107,414\nBad debt written off\n-\n-\n2,373\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n87,754\n104,160\n193,939\nDepreciation of investment property\n3,172\n3,012\n6,168\nGain on disposal of property, plant & equipment\n(430)\n-\n(25,394)\nGain on termination of right-of-use assets\n-\n-\n(59)\nImpairment loss on trade receivables\n-\n-\n607,173\nGain on disposal of subsidiary\n-\n-\n(34)\nInterest expenses\n203,746\n156,660\n357,380\nInterest income\n(12,746)\n(13,915)\n(46,246)\nProperty, plant and equipment written off\n-\n45\n115\nReversal on impairment loss on trade receivable\n-\n-\n(434,983)\nShare of post-tax loss of equity accounted associates\n109,634\n157,630\n584,896\nUnrealised loss/(gain) on forex\n-\n-\n(3,253)\nOperating loss before working capital changes\n(514,270)\n(1,212,820)\n(2,121,152)\nDecrease in inventories\n461,065\n379,613\n625,822\nIncrease in receivables\n(838,428)\n(588,199)\n(2,146,882)\nIncrease in amount due to directors & shareholder\n468\n23,000\n16,532\n(Decrease)/Increase in payables\n(263,671)\n(520,412)\n1,815,888\nCash used in operations\n(1,154,836)\n(1,918,818)\n(1,809,792)\n9.\nContingent liabilities\nIn the period under review, corporate guarantees of RM44.1 million (\u00a37.64 million) (H1 2024: RM29.1 million (\u00a34.88 million)) were given to a licensed bank by the Company for credit facilities granted to a subsidiary company.\n10.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared applying the same accounting policies that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 except for the adoption of new and amended reporting standards, which are effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2025. Various amendments to standards and interpretations of standards are effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2025 as detailed in the 2024 Annual Report, none of which have any impact on reported results.\nAmortisation of intangible assets\nSoftware is amortised over its estimated useful life. Management estimated the useful life of this asset to be within 10 years. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development could impact the economic useful life therefore future amortisation could be revised.\nThe Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash generating units (\"CGU\") to which goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimation of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\nThe research and development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life span of the developed assets. Management estimated the useful life of these assets to be within 5 years. Changes in the technological developments could impact the economic useful life and the residual values of these assets, therefore future amortisation charges could be revised.\nImpairment of goodwill on consolidation\nThe Group's cash flow projections include estimates of sales. However, if the projected sales do not materialise there is a risk that the value of goodwill would be impaired.\nThe Directors have carried out a detailed impairment review in respect of goodwill. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, by considering cash flows forecasts. The cash flow projections are based on the assumption that the Group can realise projected sales. A prudent approach has been applied with no residual value being factored. At the period end, based on these assumptions there was no indication of impairment of the value of goodwill or of development costs.\nResearch and development costs\nAll research costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.\nExpenditure incurred on projects to develop new products is capitalised and deferred only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the project and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the development. Product development expenditures which do not meet these criteria are expensed when incurred.\nDevelopment costs, considered to have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less any impairment losses and are amortised through other operating expenses in the income statement using the straight-line basis over the commercial lives of the underlying products not exceeding 5 years. Impairment is assessed whenever there is an indication of impairment and the amortisation period and method are also reviewed at least at each Statement of Financial Position date.\n11.\nDividends\nThe Company has not proposed or declared an interim dividend.\n12.\nInterim report\nThis interim financial statement will, in accordance with Rule 26 of the AIM Rules for Companies, be available shortly on the Company's website at\nwww.mobilityone.com.my\n.\n-Ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

With connections to various service providers across industries such as banking, telecommunications, utilities, government agencies, and transportation, the Group operates through multiple distribution channels including mobile wallets, e-commerce sites, EDC terminals, automated teller machines, kiosks, and internet & mobile banking. Holding licenses in regulated spaces including acquiring, e-money, remittance and lending, the Group offers a range of services to the market, including wallet, internet, and terminal-based payment services, white label e-money, remittance, lending, and custom fintech ecosystems for communities. The Group's flexible, scalable technology platform enables cash, debit card, and credit card transactions from multiple devices while providing robust control and monitoring of product and service distribution.\nFor more information, refer to our website at\nwww.mobilityone.com.my\nChairman's statement\nThe Group's revenue increased by 4.9% to \u00a3116.0 million for the first six months of 2025, compared to \u00a3110.5 million in the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily due to favourable exchange rates in H1 2025 in comparison to the corresponding period in 2024. However, when compared in Malaysian Ringgit, the Group's revenue for H1 2025 declined by 0.3%. This was mainly due to marginally reduced sales in the Group's core products and services in the main market in Malaysia, including mobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payment services through the Group's banking channels (mobile and internet banking). On the other hand, the sales through the Group's\nelectronic data capture terminals, payment gateway services and third parties' e-wallet applications as well as e-money services in Malaysia showed a promising improvement of more than 50% in H1 2025\n.\nThe Group reported a reduced loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million for the first half of 2025, compared to a loss after tax of \u00a31.68 million during the same period in 2024. This improvement was mainly attributed to a slight improvement of the overall gross profit margin, lower administrative expenses and the Group's share of a reduced loss from its 49%-owned associate company, Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd\n(\"\nSincere\n\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hati International Sdn Bhd (\"\nHati\n\"), a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia.\nThe Group's international remittance services in Malaysia\nexperienced higher transaction volumes, but\nthe contribution remains relatively modest. For the business in Brunei, w\nhile the Group is hopeful of its business growth, the operation represents an insignificant proportion of the Group's overall business. The Group has ceased exploring new business in the Philippines and has since discontinued its operations in the Philippines.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents (including fixed deposits classified under other financial assets) of approximately\n\u00a33.0 million\n(30 June 2024: cash and cash equivalents of \u00a34.41 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a36.94 million (30 June 2024: \u00a36.57 million)\nmainly due to higher finance costs and higher other operating expenses.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nThe Group's business activities continue to be predominately concentrated\nin Malaysia.\nMobile phone pre",

This downward trend aligns with the broader telecommunications sector dynamics in Malaysia, where the overall mobile segment revenue trend is slightly down or relatively flat due to intense competition and price pressures.\nIn FY2024, the Group registered a loss after tax of \u00a33.45 million (FY2023: loss after tax of \u00a31.41 million). The Group's increase in loss after tax was mainly due to lower sales, higher administrative and marketing expenses aimed at customer acquisition and retention, higher finance costs and the Group's share of its 49%-owned associated company's loss, namely Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd (\"\nSincere\n\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hati International Sdn Bhd (\"\nHati\n\"), a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia.\nDuring FY2024, the Group's electronic payment and e-money services in Malaysia continued to operate on a modest scale, contributing minimally to the Group's overall revenues. Despite the broader national trend of increasing e-payment adoption with e-payment transactions growing, the Group's offerings in this segment attracted only a limited share of the overall market. On the other hand, the Group's international remittance services in Malaysia experienced higher transaction volumes in FY2024 in comparison to the previous financial year. This increase in transaction volume was driven by increased demand for cross-border money transfers and the Group's continued efforts to enhance its remittance platform.\nIn Brunei, the Group obtained regulatory approval in FY2024 from Brunei's central bank to operate electronic payment services, merchant acquiring services, and account services. While the Group is hopeful of the growth of its business in Brunei, as of 31 December 2024 the Group's operations in Brunei represents an insignificant proportion of the Group's overall business. As announced previously by the Group, the Group ceased exploring new business in the Philippines and has since discontinued operations in the Philippines.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group had cash and cash equivalents\n(excluding other financial assets which are fixed deposits with maturities over 3 months)\nof \u00a33.98 million (31 December 2023: cash and cash equivalents\n(excluding other financial assets which are fixed deposits with maturities over 3 months)\nof \u00a33.54 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a37.07 million (31 December 2023: \u00a34.22 million) mainly due to payments for higher cost of sales and higher administrative expenses.\nReview of activities and outlook\nThe Group's business activities continue to be predominately concentrated\nin Malaysia. With this in mind, the Central Bank of Malaysia reported that Malaysia's economy grew 4.4% in",

With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n18 June 2025\nMobilityOne Limited\n(\"\nMobilityOne\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nTrading update\nMobilityOne (AIM: MBO), the e-commerce infrastructure payment solutions and platform provider, announces an update on trading and future outlook prior to release of its audited results for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 (\"\nFY 2024\n\") which are expected to be published by the end of June 2025.\nHighlights\n:\n\u00b7\nUnaudited revenue of \u00a3230.2 million (2023: revenue of \u00a3241.67 million) with the decline in revenue due to softer demand in the\nGroup's mobile phone prepaid airtime reload and bill payment business;\n\u00b7\nIncreased unaudited loss after tax of \u00a33.45 million (2023: loss after tax of \u00a31.41 million);\n\u00b7\nCash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2024 of \u00a33.98 million (31 December 2023: \u00a33.54 million);\n\u00b7\nSecured loans and borrowings as at 31 December 2024 of \u00a37.07 million (31 December 2023: \u00a34.22 million);\nand\n\u00b7\nThe Directors anticipate a challenging business environment and remain cautious about the outlook for the remainder of 2025. Notwithstanding this, the Group is implementing targeted initiatives across its core business segments aimed at turning around the Group's performance and positioning the Group for sustainable growth.\nThe Group expects to report revenues of approximately \u00a3230.2 million for FY 2024 (2023: revenue of \u00a3241.67 million). This decline in revenues is primarily due to softer demand in the Group's main market in Malaysia, particularly in the mobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payment services through the Group's banking channels (i.e. mobile banking and internet banking) and electronic data capture terminals as well as third parties' e-wallet applications. As reported by the two main telecommunications companies in Malaysia, being Maxis and CelcomDigi, mobile prepaid revenues experienced a decline in 2024, with Maxis reporting a 2.1% decrease and CelcomDigi reporting a 3.5% decrease. This downward trend aligns with the broader telecommunications sector dynamics in Malaysia, where the overall mobile segment revenue trend is slightly down or relatively flat due to intense competition and price pressures.\nIn FY 2024, the Group also expects to register a loss after tax of \u00a33.45 million (2023: loss after tax of \u00a31.41 million). The Group's increase in loss after tax is mainly due to lower sales, higher administrative and marketing expenses aimed at customer acquisition and retention, higher finance costs and the Group's share of its 49%-owned associated company's loss, namely Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd (\"\nSincere\n\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hati International Sdn Bhd (\"\nHati\n\"), a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group had unaudited cash and cash equivalents\n(excluding other financial assets which are fixed deposits with maturities over 3 months)\nof \u00a33.98 million (31 December 2023: cash and cash equivalents\n(excluding other financial assets which are fixed deposits with maturities over 3 months)\nof \u00a33.54 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a37.07 million (31 December 2023: \u00a34.22 million) mainly due to payments for higher cost of sales and higher administrative expenses.\nAll figures stated above for\nFY 2024\nare based on unaudited financial figures and are subject to\nfinalisation of the Group's audit.\nWhile the audit is ongoing, the auditors\nin both the UK and Malaysia\nare conducting an impairment assessment and\nare reviewing the possibility of a partial impairment in connection with the Company's investment in its 49% interest in Sincere, which is a holding company for Hati.\nOutlook and business update:\nLooking ahead, there are two major transactions pending completion, which are anticipated to materially impact the future financial performance and position of the Group.\n(1) Disposal of OneShop Retail Sdn Bhd\n(\"1Shop\")\nand proposed joint venture with Super Apps Holdings Sdn Bhd\n(\"Super Apps\")\nOn 19 October 2022,\nMobilityOne Sdn Bhd (\"\nM1 Malaysia\n\")\nentered into a share sale agreement\n(the \"\nShare Sale Agreement\n\")\nwith Super Apps for the disposal by M1 Malaysia of a 60% shareholding in the Group's wholly-owned non-core subsidiary 1Shop to Super Apps (together the \"\nDisposal\n\").

With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n27 June 2024\nMobilityOne Limited\n(\"\nMobilityOne\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nDelay in publication of Annual Report and Accounts\nTrading update\nMobilityOne (AIM: MBO), the e-commerce infrastructure payment solutions and platform provider, announces that its audited annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 (\"\nFY 2023\n\") will not be finalised ahead of the deadline of 30 June 2024, as stipulated under Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements for FY 2023 has been ongoing. Notwithstanding this, despite the best efforts of all parties, the auditors in both the UK and Malaysia require further time to complete their audits and the procedures with respect thereto. Accordingly, the Company expects the accounts to be published by the end of July 2024.\nThe primary reason for the delay in the audit being completed relates to further audit work that the Company's auditors in the UK have requested to be undertaken in connection with the Company's 49% interest in Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd (\"\nSincere\n\"), which is a holding company for Hati International Sdn Bhd, a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia. The Company's interest in Sincere was acquired in FY 2023 and further details can be found in the Company's announcements released on 29 September 2023 and 8 March 2024. MobilityOne's interest in Sincere will not be consolidated in the Group accounts. However, it will be held as an associated company on the Group's balance sheet.\nBased on the unaudited accounts that have been prepared and audited to date, the Company anticipates reporting revenue of \u00a3241.6 million for FY 2023 (year ended 31 December 2022: revenue of \u00a3233.76 million) as a result of increased demand from the Group's main products and services,\nnamely the\nmobile phone prepaid airtime reload and bill payment business through the Group's banking channels (i.e. mobile banking and internet banking) and electronic data capture terminals as well as third parties' e-wallet applications.\nAs a result of\nan increase in cost of sales, administrative expenses, finance costs as well as the Group's share of its 49%-owned associated company's loss, namely Sincere, the Group anticipates registering a loss\nafter tax of approximately \u00a31.4 million in FY 2023 (year ended 31 December 2022: profit after tax of \u00a316,628).\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had cash and cash equivalents\n(including fixed deposits)\nof approximately \u00a32.7 million (31 December 2022: cash and cash equivalents of \u00a35.02 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to approximately \u00a34.2 million (31 December 2022: \u00a33.87 million)\nmainly due to payment for higher cost of sales and higher administrative expenses.\nThese headline financials for FY 2023 remain subject to change and completion of the audit process.\nThis delay to the publication of the audited FY 2023 annual accounts means that trading in the Company's ordinary shares on AIM will be suspended with effect from 7:30 a.m. on 1 July 2024 and will remain suspended until the publication of its audited FY 2023 annual accounts.\nThe Company will release further announcements as and when appropriate.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03 89963600\nDato' Hussian A.

The Acquisition is expected to be completed within 30 days from the date of the Agreement.\nRelated party transaction\nThe entry by M1 Malaysia into the Agreement with the Vendors (which include Hussian and Derrick who are also both directors and shareholders of MobilityOne) is classed as a transaction with a related party under the AIM Rules for Companies.\u00a0In addition, Hussian holds equity interests in MBP and LMS and is separately a director of Jejak. Accordingly, the Directors of MobilityOne (with the exception of Hussian and Derrick) having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Allenby Capital Limited, consider that\u00a0the terms of the Agreement are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03 89963600\nDato' Hussian A.

As a result, the Proposed Disposal has now completed.\nNotwithstanding the completion of the Proposed Disposal, under the terms and conditions of the Supplementary Agreement if the Merger Exercise does not complete, M1 Malaysia is entitled to purchase back its former 60% interest in 1Shop from Super Apps for a nominal consideration of RM1.0.\nAccordingly, and irrespective of the completion of the Proposed Disposal, it remains the case that subject to the completion of the Merger Exercise Super Apps shall pay M1 Malaysia the following consideration:\n(i) RM40.0 million (equivalent to c. \u00a36.8 million) in cash within 14 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise; and\n(ii) RM20.0 million (equivalent to c. \u00a33.40 million) in cash within 180 days upon completion of the Merger Exercise.\nConditionality in relation to the Merger Exercise\nThe receipt of the consideration outlined above in relation to the Proposed Disposal and the Proposed Joint Venture continues to be conditional on the completion of the Merger Exercise - which the Group continues to have no control over. As a result, there can be no guarantee that M1 Malaysia will receive the consideration in respect of the Proposed Disposal and/or the Proposed Joint Venture.\nAll other terms and conditions in relation to the Proposed Disposal and the Proposed Joint Venture, as announced by the Company on 19 Octoboer 2022, remain unchanged. The Company will release further announcements as and when appropriate.\nUnless otherwise defined herein, the capitalised defined terms used in this announcement have the same meaning as those used in the Company's announcement on 19 October 2022.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03 89963600\nDato' Hussian A.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be effected in two steps: (i) TETE will reincorporate in the Cayman Islands by merging with and into TETE TECHNOLOGIES INC, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TETE (\"\nPubCo\n\"), with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the \"\nReincorporation Merger\n\"); (ii) after the Reincorporation Merger, TETE INTERNATIONAL INC (\"\nMerger Sub\n\"), a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, will be merged with and into Holdings, resulting in Holdings being a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (the \"\nAcquisition Merger\n\"). The Merger Agreement is by and among TETE, PubCo, Merger Sub, Holdings, Super Apps Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings, Technology & Telecommunication LLC, as the representative of the shareholders of TETE, and Loo See Yuen, an individual as the representative of the shareholders of Holdings.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Acquisition Merger is $1,100,000,000, payable in the form of 110,000,000 newly issued PubCo Ordinary Shares (the \"Closing Payment Shares\") valued at $10.00 per share, of which $235,000,000 shall be paid at Closing with the remaining $865,000,000 payable subject to the earn-out provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to Holdings and its shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Acquisition Merger, the issued and outstanding shares in Holdings held by the former Holdings shareholders will be cancelled and cease to exist, in exchange for the issuance of the Closing Payment Shares, 10% of which are to be issued and held in escrow to satisfy any indemnification obligations incurred under the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Acquisition Merger, the one fully paid share in Merger Sub held by PubCo will become one fully paid share in the surviving corporation, so that Holdings will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo.

Notwithstanding the higher sales,\nthe Group registered a lower profit\nafter t\nax of\n\u00a35,117\nin\nthe first six months of 2023 (H1 2022: profit after tax of \u00a30.34 million) mainly due to a reduction in gross profit margin in the period under review to 5.08% (H1 2022: gross profit margin of 5.52%),\nhigher administrative expenses and higher finance costs.\nThe Group's other businesses such as its international remittance services, EDC terminals sales and services, e-money and lending in Malaysia as well as the e-payment solutions activities in Brunei continued to remain small. The Group did not record any sales in the Philippines in the\nfirst six months of 2023.\nAs at 30 June 2023, the Group had cash and cash equivalents (including fixed deposits) of\n\u00a33.42 million\n(30 June 2022: cash and cash equivalents of \u00a34.72 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a34.14 million (30 June 2022: \u00a32.89 million).\nCurrent trading and outlook\nThe Group's business activities are still predominately concentrated in Malaysia. Other than the Group's main business activities of mobile phone prepaid airtime reload and bill payment in Malaysia, the Group's other businesses are expected to remain insignificant in 2023. As reported by\nthe Central Bank of Malaysia in August 2023, the Malaysian economy grew by 2.9% in the second quarter of 2023 weighed mainly by slower external demand. Domestic demand remained the key driver of growth, supported by private consumption and investment. With the challenging global environment, the Malaysian economy is projected to expand close to the lower end of the 4.0% to 5.0% range in 2023. Growth will continue to be supported by domestic demand amid improving employment and income as well as implementation of multi-year projects.\nAs part of the Group's business plans for long-term growth, the Group has the following initiatives:\n(1) Prop",

With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n29 September 2023\nMobilityOne Limited\n(\"\nMobilityOne\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nAcquisition of 49% equity interest in Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd\nVertical integration into the\nhealthcare information systems industry\nMobilityOne (AIM: MBO), the e-commerce infrastructure payment solutions and platform provider, is pleased to announce that\nMobilityOne Sdn Bhd (\"\nM1 Malaysia\n\"), the Group's wholly-owned operating subsidiary in Malaysia, has entered into a share sale agreement (the \"\nAgreement\n\") with United Flagship Development Sdn Bhd (the \"\nVendor\n\") on 29\nSeptember\n2023 to\nacquire a 49% equity interest in Sincere Acres Sdn Bhd (\"\nSincere\n\") for a total cash consideration of RM30,000,000 (c. \u00a35.217 million*) (together the \"\nProposed\nAcquisition\n\").\nSincere is an investment holding company with its sole business activity comprising of owning a 100% equity interest in Hati International Sdn Bhd (\"\nHati\n\", and together with Sincere, the \"\nSincere\nGroup\n\"), an operating company in Malaysia. Hati is a healthcare information systems provider in Malaysia focused on healthcare software development and information technology. T\nhrough the use of cloud service platforms and software system solutions, Hati has developed a product suite comprising of hospital information systems, clinical information systems, business intelligence platforms and Internet of Things (IoT)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled platforms\n.\nFurther information in relation to Hati is available on Hati's website:\nhttps://hatiintl.com/about-hati\n.\nThe Proposed Acquisition will enable the Group to, amongst other benefits, diversify its existing business activities into the growing healthcare information systems industry.\nBackground to and reasons for the Proposed Acquisition\nThe board of directors of the Group (the \"\nBoard\n\") considers that the Proposed Acquisition will result in a number of synergistic benefits for both the Group and Hati. The Proposed Acquisition is anticipated to\nenable the Group to vertically integrate its existing electronic payment systems and services with Hati's suite of existing products to support payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards and eWallets via online payments and over the counter payments. In addition, the Proposed Acquisition will result in Hati being able to utilise the Group's infrastructure and engineering know-how to automate electronic billing and invoicing.\nFollowing completion of the Proposed Acquisition, and as part of the Group's long-term growth strategy, the Group intends to develop a payment system that integrates the Group's e-claims and e-payments services with insurance companies thereby resolving cash flow issues typically faced by hospitals and clinics. The Group also intends to explore potential collaborations with the Group's telecommunication partners in order to enable Hati's real-time IoT/AI enabled healthcare devices to operate over 5G cellular networks. The above proposed developments will also contribute to the Group expanding its customer base for its existing electronic payment systems and services.\nIn addition, the Board is attracted to the future prospects of Hati. For example, Hati has invested substantially in research and development (\"\nR&D\n\") to date and, accordingly, the Board believes that Hati is well positioned to secure several commercial projects from the private and public sectors in Malaysia. Similarly, the Board believes that there is long-term scope for Hati to expand its healthcare information system offering to other countries globally.\nTerms of the Proposed Acquisition\nPursuant to the terms of the Proposed Acquisition, the RM30,000,000 (c. \u00a35.217 million*) cash consideration will be paid to the Vendor in two tranches. The first tranche, representing RM2.0 million (c. \u00a30.348 million*), will be paid shortly by M1 Malaysia to the Vendor using M1 Malaysia's existing cash resources.

The purpose of the TETE Proxy Filing is to provide TETE shareholders with information on the proposals ahead of seeking approval from TETE shareholders for the Merger Exercise itself. An extraordinary general meeting will be convened in due course for this purpose by TETE once the TETE Proxy Filing is in complete form and approved by the SEC.\nAs previously announced by the Company on 19 October 2022, the payment of the consideration to MobilityOne in relation to the terms of the Proposed Disposal is subject to the completion of the Merger Exercise and such consideration payments will be dependent on timings for completion of the Merger Exercise.\nThe Company will release further announcements as and when appropriate.\nPart of the text of the TETE Proxy Filing is set out below:\n\"TETE has entered into an amended and restated agreement and plan of merger, dated as of August 2, 2023 (as it may be amended from time to time, the \"\nMerger Agreement\n\" or \"\nBusiness Combination Agreement\n\"), which provides for a Business Combination between TETE and Bradbury Capital Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company (\"\nHoldings\n\"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be effected in two steps: (i) TETE will reincorporate in the Cayman Islands by merging with and into TETE TECHNOLOGIES INC, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TETE (\"\nPubCo\n\"), with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the \"\nReincorporation Merger\n\"); (ii) after the Reincorporation Merger, TETE INTERNATIONAL INC (\"\nMerger Sub\n\"), a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, will be merged with and into Holdings, resulting in Holdings being a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (the \"\nAcquisition Merger\n\"). The Merger Agreement is by and among TETE, PubCo, Merger Sub, Holdings, Super Apps Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings, Technology & Telecommunication LLC, as the representative of the shareholders of TETE, and Loo See Yuen, an individual as the representative of the shareholders of Holdings.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Acquisition Merger is $1,100,000,000, payable in the form of 110,000,000 newly issued Combined Company Class A Ordinary Shares (the \"Closing Payment Shares\") valued at $10.00 per share to Holdings and its shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Acquisition Merger, the issued and outstanding shares in Holdings held by the former Holdings shareholders will be cancelled and cease to exist, in exchange for the issuance of the Closing Payment Shares, 10% of which are to be issued and held in escrow to satisfy any indemnification obligations incurred under the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Acquisition Merger, the one fully paid share in Merger Sub held by PubCo will become one fully paid share in the surviving corporation, so that Holdings will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo. Holders of TETE ordinary shares will be asked to approve, among other things, the Merger Agreement and the other related Proposals.

This reduction in sales can be partly attributed to the departure of many foreign workers\nfrom Malaysia and reduced overall demand for the Group's mobile phone prepaid products.\nThe Malaysian market accounted for the majority of the Group's entire revenue for the year ended 31 December 2022.\nAs a consequence of the reduction of revenue, coupled with higher administrative expenses, the Group registered a much lower profit\nafter tax of \u00a316,626 in the year ended 31 December 2022 (year ended 31 December 2021: profit after tax of \u00a31.51 million).\nThe Group's other businesses such as its international remittance services and e-money business in Malaysia and payment solution business in Brunei and the Philippines continued to remain small and did not make a material contribution to the Group in the year ended 31 December 2022\n.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had cash and cash equivalents\n(including fixed deposits)\nof \u00a35.02 million (31 December 2021: cash and cash equivalents of \u00a34.67 million) while the secured loans and borrowings from financial institutions increased to \u00a33.87 million (31 December 2021: \u00a32.18 million).\nReview of activities and outlook\nThe Group's business activities are predominately concentrated in Malaysia.\nAccording to the Central Bank of Malaysia in May 2023 it was reported that the Malaysian economy is projected to expand between 4.0% to 5.0% in 2023, driven by firm domestic demand, improving employment conditions and income as well as continued implementation of multi-year projects which would support consumption and investment activity. Nonetheless, the inflation rate is expected to stay elevated.\nMobile phone prepaid airtime reloads and bill payments will continue to be the main business activities for the Group in 2023. The Group's international remittance and e-money businesses in Malaysia as well as the payment solution business in Brunei are expected to remain insignificant. The Group has discontinued to explore new business in the Philippines and has no immediate plan to expand its business there.\nOn 1 June 2022 the Company announc",

OTR will be able to directly disburse funds into bKash e-wallet accounts for any remittance transactions facilitated in OTR's branches and through OTR's mobile application. This arrangement allows for real time disbursement into bKash e-wallet accounts. This new service offering, paired with MobilityOne's e-wallet services, MiPay, will enable wallet-to-wallet remittances for the Bangladesh corridor.\nThe Collaboration is in line with the Group's plans to digitalise OTR's range of services to enable faster and cost-efficient remittances to its users, particularly for foreign workers in Malaysia originating from Bangladesh, who are estimated to account for 37% of the foreign worker population in Malaysia. In this regard, according to data from Malaysia's Ministry of Human Resources, as of mid-2025, there were approximately 900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders registered in Malaysia, therefore supporting the strategy to digitalise OTR's range of services.\nBased on data published by the Central Bank of Malaysia, there has been a significant increase in e-remittance adoption in Malaysia, with over 40% of outward remittances completed digitally in 2024. It is with digital innovations and cross border collaborations such as this, that OTR plans to increase its market share in remittances by converting more customers from traditional cash-based remittances to e-remittance by providing faster and cost-efficient services.\nWhilst the Group is confident on the future prospects of the Collaboration, the Board currently expects any resultant revenues or earnings contribution to the Group in the next 12 months to be relatively modest.\n-ends-\nFor further information, please contact:\nMobilityOne Limited\n+6 03\u00a089963600\nDato' Hussian A.

The Collaboration, amongst other matters, was originally outlined in the Company's notification on 26 September 2025 as expected to go live in the next few months. Based on the terms of the Collaboration, OTR will be entitled to a share of the fees generated through remittance transactions that will be disbursed into bKash account holders as well as income from foreign exchange transactions. OTR will be able to directly disburse funds into bKash e-wallet accounts for any remittance transactions facilitated in OTR's branches and through OTR's mobile application. This arrangement allows for real time disbursement into bKash e-wallet accounts. This new service offering, paired with MobilityOne's e-wallet services, MiPay, will enable wallet-to-wallet remittances for the Bangladesh corridor. The Collaboration is in line with the Group's plans to digitalise OTR's range of services to enable faster and cost-efficient remittances to its users, particularly for foreign workers in Malaysia originating from Bangladesh, who are estimated to account for 37% of the foreign worker population in Malaysia. In this regard, according to data from Malaysia's Ministry of Human Resources, as of mid-2025, there were approximately 900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders registered in Malaysia, therefore supporting the strategy to digitalise OTR's range of services. Based on data published by the Central Bank of Malaysia, there has been a significant increase in e-remittance adoption in Malaysia, with over 40% of outward remittances completed digitally in 2024. It is with digital innovations and cross border collaborations such as this, that OTR plans to increase its market share in remittances by converting more customers from traditional cash-based remittances to e-remittance by providing faster and cost-efficient services.",

This is real infrastructure being put in place into bKash wallets, who have access to 82m users, and a very clear initial target market of 900k Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, no hype at all I\u2019m invested in other company\u2019s where the RNSs sound mouthwatering on paper but taking forever to deliver anything. Here, the Board is doing the opposite setting expectations low, explaining the mechanics, and letting execution do the talking. Genuinely surprised at the amount of revenue they generate across their markets, the Islamic licence will be insane. Regarding the extension, it\u2019s disappointing as it would be for anyone. That said, the most positive takeaway is that the company has not walked away from the process! They clearly still have significant capital and commitment tied into it, which suggests this is more about complexity and execution than abandonment. These processes are often far more involved than initially anticipated. I do apologise if I came across as overly confident that the February deadline was firmly set for the 20th, while that was my view at the time, it\u2019s clear there are many moving parts. Good news is that it could still conclude at any point, in my opinion, and the underlying intent appears very much intact.",

Market makers, due to their control over pricing, can contribute to this decline by lowering prices when sentiment is weak. Conversely, positive sentiment increases demand, leading to higher prices. I've witnessed numerous examples of this dynamic in the stock market. Anticipation of a potential extension to the February 20th deadline is weighing on share price sentiment. This negative sentiment is so strong that even significant buy orders are failing to increase the share price.",

Not been around for a few days with other priorities, but checking back through the historical trades it\u2019s encouraging to see how well the price is holding up. Volume stepped up to 4.3m, the highest in four sessions, and despite the volatility the price finished green at 7.25 +3.6% What really stands out is how sell pressure is thinning as price rises, earlier in the move we saw larger clips going through at lower levels, but above 7.00 the sells are noticeably smaller, with bids consistently absorbing stock. This feels far more like consolidation after a sharp move. Structure is holding, higher lows forming on the intraday chart, and volatility is beginning to compress. All of this as we head toward the Feb 20th extension deadline, just 22 business days away! As this window narrows, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see increased volume continue and volatility at higher levels, offering liquidity for those looking to exit and opportunity for those positioning ahead of the SEC approval catalyst.",

Accordingly, our board of directors has determined it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to extend the termination date from February 20, 2026 to the Extended Date.

The comfort of having held the past two weeks , yes ,..just two weeks, has restored my confidence in investing in the stock market. As pointed out by MFG we have now less than a months worth of trading days at most , if anyone wants to sell out now this week ,then they are either doing what I and many early investors have done or impatience is the monkey on your back. I am beginning to realize that I probably sold half my shares too early, but I am now confident enough to consider buying and increasing my low average to soak up the narrow float in any dip. It's like playing Jenga as a child, my first tower was pathetic but as I learned the nuanced skill of taking out the tiles, I got very good at building enormous steeples.",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",

          "content": "It\u2019s important to note that: No revenue or earnings are expected from the new Islamic banking business in 2026, it\u2019s a long-lead, future project. Also, for the full year ended 31 December 2024, MobilityOne reported a net loss of about \u00a33.45 million after tax, meaning it did not make a profit for that year. For the first half of 2025 (six months to 30 June), it also recorded a loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million, though this was smaller than the loss in the same period the previous year. Profitability is the challenge: Costs, such as administrative expenses, cost of sales, and associated company losses, have kept the company in the red. Although what can be seen encouraging is the revenue of \u00a3230.2m, however, the company is still in the loss and that's a red flag. It's actually quite worrying that they are not in profit despite having \u00a3203M of revenue. These guys had near 20 years in the business but still failed to make a profit. For that reason I have rated this a sell. Whether that will change further down the line would depend on if they can reduce expenses and admin costs. I would also like to point out that the Islamic finance is just a conditional approval for an Islamic digital banking arm in Labuan, Malaysia. It means that the operation are mostly limited to Malaysia.",

No that is far from the reality , the fact is and this is not a opinion as I have been advised from bankers that the approval is far from guaranteed and should the receive this approval this would value the company in the region of pounds not Pennys , simply and the market cap does not represent the amount of cash . revenue that can he achieved through this approval .. So realistically if we don't get approval which could happen , then off  course we will undoubtedly crash , hence many have sold out of this basis and with large profits , some life changing money .. now us long tern holders and late arrivals like myself who bought in at 7 p , well we need a approval and I believe we will be approved , now that is my opinion and I could be wrong.. so in terms of risk vs reward .. for me its worth the risk .. hence please do your ojnw research .. and make your now decisions .. remember its your money ..",

It suggests that buyers are taking control of the market from sellers. Here's a breakdown of how it works: Downtrend Precedence: The pattern appears at the end of a downtrend. Two Candlesticks: It consists of two candlesticks. The first is a small bearish (red or black) candlestick. The second is a large bullish (white or green) candlestick that completely \"engulfs\" the body of the previous candle. Market Sentiment Shift: The bullish engulfing pattern indicates a short-term change in market sentiment, potentially triggered by news, events, or price adjustments. Confirmation: To confirm the reversal, traders often look for a third bullish candlestick closing above the high of the engulfing candle. This suggests sustained upward momentum",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",

Also, for the full year ended 31 December 2024, MobilityOne reported a net loss of about \u00a33.45 million after tax, meaning it did not make a profit for that year. For the first half of 2025 (six months to 30 June), it also recorded a loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million, though this was smaller than the loss in the same period the previous year. Profitability is the challenge: Costs, such as administrative expenses, cost of sales, and associated company losses, have kept the company in the red. Although what can be seen encouraging is the revenue of \u00a3230.2m, however, the company is still in the loss and that's a red flag. It's actually quite worrying that they are not in profit despite having \u00a3203M of revenue. These guys had near 20 years in the business but still failed to make a profit. For that reason I have rated this a sell. Whether that will change further down the line would depend on if they can reduce expenses and admin costs. I would also like to point out that the Islamic finance is just a conditional approval for an Islamic digital banking arm in Labuan, Malaysia. It means that the operation are mostly limited to Malaysia.",

So realistically if we don't get approval which could happen , then off  course we will undoubtedly crash , hence many have sold out of this basis and with large profits , some life changing money .. now us long tern holders and late arrivals like myself who bought in at 7 p , well we need a approval and I believe we will be approved , now that is my opinion and I could be wrong.. so in terms of risk vs reward .. for me its worth the risk .. hence please do your ojnw research .. and make your now decisions .. remember its your money ..",

          "content": "The bullish engulfing pattern is a two-candle pattern used in technical analysis to predict the reversal of a downtrend. It suggests that buyers are taking control of the market from sellers. Here's a breakdown of how it works: Downtrend Precedence: The pattern appears at the end of a downtrend. Two Candlesticks: It consists of two candlesticks. The first is a small bearish (red or black) candlestick. The second is a large bullish (white or green) candlestick that completely \"engulfs\" the body of the previous candle. Market Sentiment Shift: The bullish engulfing pattern indicates a short-term change in market sentiment, potentially triggered by news, events, or price adjustments. Confirmation: To confirm the reversal, traders often look for a third bullish candlestick closing above the high of the engulfing candle. This suggests sustained upward momentum",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

          "content": "Reading the recent Bangladesh related news in isolation misses the point. When you put it together, the picture is much clearer. Fact 1 bKash has already processed 5 million inbound remittance transactions in 10 months, settled via Pubali Bank PLC, across 33 countries and 11 international MTOs, with instant wallet credit and government FX incentives so proven national scale infrastructure https://www.thedailystar.net/business/organisation-news/news/bkash-sees-50-lakh-remittance-transfers-through-pubali-bank-10 Fact 2 The bank and bKash went fully 24/7 with automated cash and liquidity management for agents and distributors. We now have always on settlement, real-time liquidity, and no banking cutoffs. Pubali is clearly acting as the core settlement and liquidity bank behind bKash. Fact 3 We confirmed our  collaboration goes live next week giving real-time disbursement into bKash wallets, wallet-to-wallet remittance, fee share plus FX income targeting 900,000 Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia .. 37% of foreign workers. At the time of the RNS, the question was whether this could scale. With bKash already settling millions of remittances via Pubali, and liquidity now running 24/7 that question is effectively answered in today\u2019s news. We ain\u2019t building new rails in Bangladesh we are plugging into an existing, regulated, alwayson digital money system that\u2019s already operating at scale. We don\u2019t need a RNS naming a settlement bank becauseCorrespondent and liquidity banks don\u2019t get headline mentions, they run the infrastructure and Pubali is already doing that job for bKash. The board\u2019s comment about near-term revenues being \u201cmodest\u201d is sensible caution and the risk profile has shifted to proven settlement at scale,24/7 liquidity, fees and FX participation, zero infrastructure rebuild.

          "content": "MXD, for the first time in over 200 posts you\u2019ve actually put something on the table that can be discussed rather than reacted to with an emoji. That\u2019s a step in the right direction, and credit where it\u2019s due. Opinions are exactly that, opinions, and when they\u2019re grounded in something tangible, they can be debated. So, let\u2019s go through your points, because there is substance in parts of it, but the framing is doing a lot of heavy lifting. 1. Volatility Yes, MBO is volatile. It\u2019s AIM, volatility is the entry fee, not a plot twist. The same mechanism that gave you a -40% swing last week is the one that gave you +40% today. If that\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d, then the bar really has been on the floor. 2. Negative equity / working capital You\u2019ve dressed this up like a red siren, but settlement based fintech\u2019s often show negative equity because of timing windows, money in transit, float obligations, settlement cycles. It\u2019s accounting mechanics, not a death rattle. But sure, it sounds dramatic when you frame it that way. 3. Debt levels Debt to equity ratios become meaningless when equity is temporarily negative. It inflates the number into something monstrous. The real question is whether obligations are being serviced. 4. Insider ownership High insider ownership reduces liquidity, yes, but it also means the people running the business actually care about the outcome. It\u2019s not inherently negative unless you\u2019re trying to make it sound like a Bond villain subplot. 5. Regulatory exposure Fair point, but Malaysia is one of the more stable fintech regulatory environments in ASEAN. The Bangladesh corridor has more moving parts, but that\u2019s also where the upside sits. You can\u2019t have corridor based growth without corridor based regulation. That\u2019s how corridors work. 6. \u201cSpeculative nature\u201d Every early stage fintech corridor play is speculative until the rails go live. That\u2019s why 15 Feb matters; it\u2019s the moment the business moves from potential to operational. After that, speculation becomes data. What your analysis is missing entirely You\u2019ve listed the risks, fine. But investment is risk vs reward, and you\u2019ve only covered the half that lets you use dramatic wording. The reward side includes: \u2022\tthe Malaysia - Bangladesh corridor \u2022\treal time wallet disbursement \u2022\tfee share + FX income \u2022\tintegration into the bKash ecosystem \u2022\tecosystem upgrades like Pubali Bank improving the receiving rail \u2022\tregulatory approvals already secured You can\u2019t analyse MBO purely through historical financials. You analyse it through future cashflows and corridor scalability, otherwise you\u2019re just reading numbers out loud. So yes, MXD, credit where it\u2019s due. For the first time in 200+ posts, you\u2019ve produced something that can actually be discussed rather than scrolled past.",

All of this is visible in the original admission document and today\u2019s information https://www.mobilityone.com.my/v7/admission-report.html For an AIM listed fintech/payments business, or in fact any type of business this level of capital discipline is exceptionally rare, in fact I would love to see a chart which shows this type of information and statistics! According to a Grant Thornton, 75% of all funds raised by AIM companies since 2007 have been through secondary issues.

          "content": "It\u2019s important to note that: No revenue or earnings are expected from the new Islamic banking business in 2026, it\u2019s a long-lead, future project. Also, for the full year ended 31 December 2024, MobilityOne reported a net loss of about \u00a33.45 million after tax, meaning it did not make a profit for that year. For the first half of 2025 (six months to 30 June), it also recorded a loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million, though this was smaller than the loss in the same period the previous year. Profitability is the challenge: Costs, such as administrative expenses, cost of sales, and associated company losses, have kept the company in the red. Although what can be seen encouraging is the revenue of \u00a3230.2m, however, the company is still in the loss and that's a red flag. It's actually quite worrying that they are not in profit despite having \u00a3203M of revenue. These guys had near 20 years in the business but still failed to make a profit. For that reason I have rated this a sell. Whether that will change further down the line would depend on if they can reduce expenses and admin costs. I would also like to point out that the Islamic finance is just a conditional approval for an Islamic digital banking arm in Labuan, Malaysia. It means that the operation are mostly limited to Malaysia.",

No that is far from the reality , the fact is and this is not a opinion as I have been advised from bankers that the approval is far from guaranteed and should the receive this approval this would value the company in the region of pounds not Pennys , simply and the market cap does not represent the amount of cash . revenue that can he achieved through this approval .. So realistically if we don't get approval which could happen , then off  course we will undoubtedly crash , hence many have sold out of this basis and with large profits , some life changing money .. now us long tern holders and late arrivals like myself who bought in at 7 p , well we need a approval and I believe we will be approved , now that is my opinion and I could be wrong.. so in terms of risk vs reward .. for me its worth the risk .. hence please do your ojnw research .. and make your now decisions .. remember its your money ..",

It suggests that buyers are taking control of the market from sellers. Here's a breakdown of how it works: Downtrend Precedence: The pattern appears at the end of a downtrend. Two Candlesticks: It consists of two candlesticks. The first is a small bearish (red or black) candlestick. The second is a large bullish (white or green) candlestick that completely \"engulfs\" the body of the previous candle. Market Sentiment Shift: The bullish engulfing pattern indicates a short-term change in market sentiment, potentially triggered by news, events, or price adjustments. Confirmation: To confirm the reversal, traders often look for a third bullish candlestick closing above the high of the engulfing candle. This suggests sustained upward momentum",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",

That tells me this isn\u2019t aggressive distribution  it\u2019s more a lack of interest while people wait for clarity. Low volume and chasing up other AIM stocks with great news to ride the momentum of. But every quiet day like this is simply one day closer to the actual catalysts of the \u00a310 million from the SPAC JV\u2026 Mastercard Send executio\u2026  bKash scaling through an already proven corridor\u2026  Islamic digital banking progressing in the background. None of those are hope and pray events. They\u2019re execution and balance sheet positive events. The price can drift on low volume, but the story only really changes when one of those lands and that\u2019s what sends this into a frenzy again as people try to get back in, but this time there\u2019s more holders at higher levels and the news catalyst adds a new string to our bow increasing our value. Enjoy the ride Or watch from the side lines commenting every day on a forum to strangers who have a vested interest in a company you\u2019re never going to get involved with\u2026 until let us guess, 4p a share?",

I\u2019ve just gone back through a few RNSs this evening and I actually think we\u2019re due another announcement fairly soon around Mastercard Send. It\u2019s mentioned alongside bKash in the half year, so it feels like the next logical step? When you look at the recent bKash news in that context, it starts to make a lot more sense especially when you remember we\u2019re doing \u00a3230 million in revenue and still losing money. That tells you straight away the issue here isn\u2019t scale, it\u2019s margin mix. The legacy business around airtime reloads and bill payments does huge volume, but at very thin margins, and to be fair the Board has been pretty open about that. Where it gets interesting now is what\u2019s now being layered on top. bKash isn\u2019t a concept or a pilot as shared in my original post, expats sent remittances more than five million times, settled instantly via Pubali. That corridor now runs 24/7, 365. The behaviour is already there and it\u2019s trusted, it\u2019s repeat usage at scale, and as you mentioned, the working patterns and hours are very different to what most people are used to in the UK. We\u2019re not trying to invent demand here. We\u2019re plugging into an ecosystem where remittance is frequent, digital and increasingly stays inside the wallet for bills, payments and services which is exactly where fee income and FX margin live! The Board has been clear that remittance revenues will be \u201crelatively modest\u201d, and that makes total sense against a \u00a3230m revenue base. But the point isn\u2019t headline growth anymore, it\u2019s quality. At this scale, even a small improvement in blended margin has an outsized impact and roughly speaking, a 1% uplift in margin is worth north of \u00a32 million The strategy explicitly references Mastercard Send still to come. That\u2019s not name dropping or hype. it\u2019s better infrastructure with faster settlement, broader corridor reach, lower friction and better transaction velocity. You don\u2019t add that unless the volumes already justify it, and in this case we  clearly do. The real question now is whether the economics on flows we already have can be steadily improved. If they can we just need better rails on existing, and very soon expanding, transaction volumes! Bodes well for the SPAC listing!",

This hassle-free and secure service, offered by the mobile financial service (MFS) provider bKash, has earned the trust of expatriates and their families, encouraging sending remittances through legal channels, strengthening the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves. Recently, a ceremony was held at bKash\u2019s headquarters to celebrate this achievement where Pubali Bank\u2019s Managing Director and CEO Mohammad Ali and bKash\u2019s CEO Kamal Quadir, along with senior officials from both organisations were present. They highlighted the significance of this joint service and pledged to make remittance services even easier and safer for users. As a vital lifeline for the country's economy, these hard-earned remittances from expatriates are boosting the country's foreign exchange reserves and contributing to macroeconomic stability. To facilitate this, Pubali Bank and bKash have created a robust ecosystem for expatriates, to send remittances easily and securely. Currently, expatriates from 33 countries can send remittances through 11 international Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), which are settled instantly in the recipient's bKash account through Pubali Bank. Besides, recipients receive a government incentive of Tk 25 per thousand. They can easily cash out the remittance from nearby bKash agent points. Moreover, Families of the expatriates can utilise remittance to take various services through their bKash accounts, including paying for products and services, utility bills (gas, electricity, water), sending money, mobile recharge, paying educational and government fees, donations, insurance premiums, microfinance payments and many other services from the comfort of their homes. In addition to offering convenient, instant and secure remittance transfers, bKash has lowered cash-out fees. Beneficiaries can now withdraw remittances at a minimal cost of Tk 7 per thousand from approximately 2,500 ATMs of 19 leading commercial banks.

While independent of MBO, this strengthens the bKash ecosystem's liquidity, making the \"receiving\" end more attractive for MBO's customers. \u2022 User Base: With ~900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders in Malaysia, even capturing a 5\u201310% market share of this specific corridor would represent a significant volume for a company of MBO's size (Market Cap ~\u00a36m).

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

          "content": "Reading the recent Bangladesh related news in isolation misses the point. When you put it together, the picture is much clearer. Fact 1 bKash has already processed 5 million inbound remittance transactions in 10 months, settled via Pubali Bank PLC, across 33 countries and 11 international MTOs, with instant wallet credit and government FX incentives so proven national scale infrastructure https://www.thedailystar.net/business/organisation-news/news/bkash-sees-50-lakh-remittance-transfers-through-pubali-bank-10 Fact 2 The bank and bKash went fully 24/7 with automated cash and liquidity management for agents and distributors. We now have always on settlement, real-time liquidity, and no banking cutoffs. Pubali is clearly acting as the core settlement and liquidity bank behind bKash. Fact 3 We confirmed our  collaboration goes live next week giving real-time disbursement into bKash wallets, wallet-to-wallet remittance, fee share plus FX income targeting 900,000 Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia .. 37% of foreign workers. At the time of the RNS, the question was whether this could scale. With bKash already settling millions of remittances via Pubali, and liquidity now running 24/7 that question is effectively answered in today\u2019s news. We ain\u2019t building new rails in Bangladesh we are plugging into an existing, regulated, alwayson digital money system that\u2019s already operating at scale. We don\u2019t need a RNS naming a settlement bank becauseCorrespondent and liquidity banks don\u2019t get headline mentions, they run the infrastructure and Pubali is already doing that job for bKash. The board\u2019s comment about near-term revenues being \u201cmodest\u201d is sensible caution and the risk profile has shifted to proven settlement at scale,24/7 liquidity, fees and FX participation, zero infrastructure rebuild.

          "content": "MXD, for the first time in over 200 posts you\u2019ve actually put something on the table that can be discussed rather than reacted to with an emoji. That\u2019s a step in the right direction, and credit where it\u2019s due. Opinions are exactly that, opinions, and when they\u2019re grounded in something tangible, they can be debated. So, let\u2019s go through your points, because there is substance in parts of it, but the framing is doing a lot of heavy lifting. 1. Volatility Yes, MBO is volatile. It\u2019s AIM, volatility is the entry fee, not a plot twist. The same mechanism that gave you a -40% swing last week is the one that gave you +40% today. If that\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d, then the bar really has been on the floor. 2. Negative equity / working capital You\u2019ve dressed this up like a red siren, but settlement based fintech\u2019s often show negative equity because of timing windows, money in transit, float obligations, settlement cycles. It\u2019s accounting mechanics, not a death rattle. But sure, it sounds dramatic when you frame it that way. 3. Debt levels Debt to equity ratios become meaningless when equity is temporarily negative. It inflates the number into something monstrous. The real question is whether obligations are being serviced. 4. Insider ownership High insider ownership reduces liquidity, yes, but it also means the people running the business actually care about the outcome. It\u2019s not inherently negative unless you\u2019re trying to make it sound like a Bond villain subplot. 5. Regulatory exposure Fair point, but Malaysia is one of the more stable fintech regulatory environments in ASEAN. The Bangladesh corridor has more moving parts, but that\u2019s also where the upside sits. You can\u2019t have corridor based growth without corridor based regulation. That\u2019s how corridors work. 6. \u201cSpeculative nature\u201d Every early stage fintech corridor play is speculative until the rails go live. That\u2019s why 15 Feb matters; it\u2019s the moment the business moves from potential to operational. After that, speculation becomes data. What your analysis is missing entirely You\u2019ve listed the risks, fine. But investment is risk vs reward, and you\u2019ve only covered the half that lets you use dramatic wording. The reward side includes: \u2022\tthe Malaysia - Bangladesh corridor \u2022\treal time wallet disbursement \u2022\tfee share + FX income \u2022\tintegration into the bKash ecosystem \u2022\tecosystem upgrades like Pubali Bank improving the receiving rail \u2022\tregulatory approvals already secured You can\u2019t analyse MBO purely through historical financials. You analyse it through future cashflows and corridor scalability, otherwise you\u2019re just reading numbers out loud. So yes, MXD, credit where it\u2019s due. For the first time in 200+ posts, you\u2019ve produced something that can actually be discussed rather than scrolled past.",

Total dilution is around 12.8% since admission Annualised dilution 0.6\u20130.7% per year Just Let that sink in for a moment Most AIM companies manage that level of dilution in 12 to 18 months, not over two decades. All of this is visible in the original admission document and today\u2019s information https://www.mobilityone.com.my/v7/admission-report.html For an AIM listed fintech/payments business, or in fact any type of business this level of capital discipline is exceptionally rare, in fact I would love to see a chart which shows this type of information and statistics! According to a Grant Thornton, 75% of all funds raised by AIM companies since 2007 have been through secondary issues. I've only ever really looked at this since you mentioned the shares held by the BOD (which I've always known is very high)  so thanks for pointing that out mxd, very good spot!!",

          "content": "It\u2019s important to note that: No revenue or earnings are expected from the new Islamic banking business in 2026, it\u2019s a long-lead, future project. Also, for the full year ended 31 December 2024, MobilityOne reported a net loss of about \u00a33.45 million after tax, meaning it did not make a profit for that year. For the first half of 2025 (six months to 30 June), it also recorded a loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million, though this was smaller than the loss in the same period the previous year. Profitability is the challenge: Costs, such as administrative expenses, cost of sales, and associated company losses, have kept the company in the red. Although what can be seen encouraging is the revenue of \u00a3230.2m, however, the company is still in the loss and that's a red flag. It's actually quite worrying that they are not in profit despite having \u00a3203M of revenue. These guys had near 20 years in the business but still failed to make a profit. For that reason I have rated this a sell. Whether that will change further down the line would depend on if they can reduce expenses and admin costs. I would also like to point out that the Islamic finance is just a conditional approval for an Islamic digital banking arm in Labuan, Malaysia. It means that the operation are mostly limited to Malaysia.",

So realistically if we don't get approval which could happen , then off  course we will undoubtedly crash , hence many have sold out of this basis and with large profits , some life changing money .. now us long tern holders and late arrivals like myself who bought in at 7 p , well we need a approval and I believe we will be approved , now that is my opinion and I could be wrong.. so in terms of risk vs reward .. for me its worth the risk .. hence please do your ojnw research .. and make your now decisions .. remember its your money ..",

It suggests that buyers are taking control of the market from sellers. Here's a breakdown of how it works: Downtrend Precedence: The pattern appears at the end of a downtrend. Two Candlesticks: It consists of two candlesticks. The first is a small bearish (red or black) candlestick. The second is a large bullish (white or green) candlestick that completely \"engulfs\" the body of the previous candle. Market Sentiment Shift: The bullish engulfing pattern indicates a short-term change in market sentiment, potentially triggered by news, events, or price adjustments. Confirmation: To confirm the reversal, traders often look for a third bullish candlestick closing above the high of the engulfing candle. This suggests sustained upward momentum",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",

The whole of yesterdays trades....BUYS AND SELLS COMBINED....equates to less than two thirds of my holding. So yes, I fully agree with you pal...the  share price can be manipulated on very small volume. The next news will send the price many multiples of what we're seeing at present!

That tells me this isn\u2019t aggressive distribution  it\u2019s more a lack of interest while people wait for clarity. Low volume and chasing up other AIM stocks with great news to ride the momentum of. But every quiet day like this is simply one day closer to the actual catalysts of the \u00a310 million from the SPAC JV\u2026 Mastercard Send executio\u2026  bKash scaling through an already proven corridor\u2026  Islamic digital banking progressing in the background. None of those are hope and pray events. They\u2019re execution and balance sheet positive events. The price can drift on low volume, but the story only really changes when one of those lands and that\u2019s what sends this into a frenzy again as people try to get back in, but this time there\u2019s more holders at higher levels and the news catalyst adds a new string to our bow increasing our value. Enjoy the ride Or watch from the side lines commenting every day on a forum to strangers who have a vested interest in a company you\u2019re never going to get involved with\u2026 until let us guess, 4p a share?",

That tells me this isn\u2019t aggressive distribution  it\u2019s more a lack of interest while people wait for clarity. Low volume and chasing up other AIM stocks with great news to ride the momentum of. But every quiet day like this is simply one day closer to the actual catalysts of the \u00a310 million from the SPAC JV\u2026 Mastercard Send executio\u2026  bKash scaling through an already proven corridor\u2026  Islamic digital banking progressing in the background. None of those are hope and pray events. They\u2019re execution and balance sheet positive events. The price can drift on low volume, but the story only really changes when one of those lands and that\u2019s what sends this into a frenzy again as people try to get back in, but this time there\u2019s more holders at higher levels and the news catalyst adds a new string to our bow increasing our value. Enjoy the ride Or watch from the side lines commenting every day on a forum to strangers who have a vested interest in a company you\u2019re never going to get involved with\u2026 until let us guess, 4p a share?",

          "content": "Very good point, Warrie  honestly didn\u2019t even cross my mind about the wortk ethic. I\u2019ve just gone back through a few RNSs this evening and I actually think we\u2019re due another announcement fairly soon around Mastercard Send. It\u2019s mentioned alongside bKash in the half year, so it feels like the next logical step? When you look at the recent bKash news in that context, it starts to make a lot more sense especially when you remember we\u2019re doing \u00a3230 million in revenue and still losing money. That tells you straight away the issue here isn\u2019t scale, it\u2019s margin mix. The legacy business around airtime reloads and bill payments does huge volume, but at very thin margins, and to be fair the Board has been pretty open about that. Where it gets interesting now is what\u2019s now being layered on top. bKash isn\u2019t a concept or a pilot as shared in my original post, expats sent remittances more than five million times, settled instantly via Pubali. That corridor now runs 24/7, 365. The behaviour is already there and it\u2019s trusted, it\u2019s repeat usage at scale, and as you mentioned, the working patterns and hours are very different to what most people are used to in the UK. We\u2019re not trying to invent demand here. We\u2019re plugging into an ecosystem where remittance is frequent, digital and increasingly stays inside the wallet for bills, payments and services which is exactly where fee income and FX margin live! The Board has been clear that remittance revenues will be \u201crelatively modest\u201d, and that makes total sense against a \u00a3230m revenue base. But the point isn\u2019t headline growth anymore, it\u2019s quality. At this scale, even a small improvement in blended margin has an outsized impact and roughly speaking, a 1% uplift in margin is worth north of \u00a32 million The strategy explicitly references Mastercard Send still to come. That\u2019s not name dropping or hype. it\u2019s better infrastructure with faster settlement, broader corridor reach, lower friction and better transaction velocity. You don\u2019t add that unless the volumes already justify it, and in this case we  clearly do. The real question now is whether the economics on flows we already have can be steadily improved. If they can we just need better rails on existing, and very soon expanding, transaction volumes! Bodes well for the SPAC listing!",

This hassle-free and secure service, offered by the mobile financial service (MFS) provider bKash, has earned the trust of expatriates and their families, encouraging sending remittances through legal channels, strengthening the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves. Recently, a ceremony was held at bKash\u2019s headquarters to celebrate this achievement where Pubali Bank\u2019s Managing Director and CEO Mohammad Ali and bKash\u2019s CEO Kamal Quadir, along with senior officials from both organisations were present. They highlighted the significance of this joint service and pledged to make remittance services even easier and safer for users. As a vital lifeline for the country's economy, these hard-earned remittances from expatriates are boosting the country's foreign exchange reserves and contributing to macroeconomic stability. To facilitate this, Pubali Bank and bKash have created a robust ecosystem for expatriates, to send remittances easily and securely. Currently, expatriates from 33 countries can send remittances through 11 international Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), which are settled instantly in the recipient's bKash account through Pubali Bank. Besides, recipients receive a government incentive of Tk 25 per thousand. They can easily cash out the remittance from nearby bKash agent points. Moreover, Families of the expatriates can utilise remittance to take various services through their bKash accounts, including paying for products and services, utility bills (gas, electricity, water), sending money, mobile recharge, paying educational and government fees, donations, insurance premiums, microfinance payments and many other services from the comfort of their homes. In addition to offering convenient, instant and secure remittance transfers, bKash has lowered cash-out fees. Beneficiaries can now withdraw remittances at a minimal cost of Tk 7 per thousand from approximately 2,500 ATMs of 19 leading commercial banks.

While independent of MBO, this strengthens the bKash ecosystem's liquidity, making the \"receiving\" end more attractive for MBO's customers. \u2022 User Base: With ~900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders in Malaysia, even capturing a 5\u201310% market share of this specific corridor would represent a significant volume for a company of MBO's size (Market Cap ~\u00a36m). Since the service launches on Feb 15, the first meaningful data on transaction volumes will likely start appearing in quarterly updates around May or June 2026.",

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

          "content": "Reading the recent Bangladesh related news in isolation misses the point. When you put it together, the picture is much clearer. Fact 1 bKash has already processed 5 million inbound remittance transactions in 10 months, settled via Pubali Bank PLC, across 33 countries and 11 international MTOs, with instant wallet credit and government FX incentives so proven national scale infrastructure https://www.thedailystar.net/business/organisation-news/news/bkash-sees-50-lakh-remittance-transfers-through-pubali-bank-10 Fact 2 The bank and bKash went fully 24/7 with automated cash and liquidity management for agents and distributors. We now have always on settlement, real-time liquidity, and no banking cutoffs. Pubali is clearly acting as the core settlement and liquidity bank behind bKash. Fact 3 We confirmed our  collaboration goes live next week giving real-time disbursement into bKash wallets, wallet-to-wallet remittance, fee share plus FX income targeting 900,000 Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia .. 37% of foreign workers. At the time of the RNS, the question was whether this could scale. With bKash already settling millions of remittances via Pubali, and liquidity now running 24/7 that question is effectively answered in today\u2019s news. We ain\u2019t building new rails in Bangladesh we are plugging into an existing, regulated, alwayson digital money system that\u2019s already operating at scale. We don\u2019t need a RNS naming a settlement bank becauseCorrespondent and liquidity banks don\u2019t get headline mentions, they run the infrastructure and Pubali is already doing that job for bKash. The board\u2019s comment about near-term revenues being \u201cmodest\u201d is sensible caution and the risk profile has shifted to proven settlement at scale,24/7 liquidity, fees and FX participation, zero infrastructure rebuild.

          "content": "MXD, for the first time in over 200 posts you\u2019ve actually put something on the table that can be discussed rather than reacted to with an emoji. That\u2019s a step in the right direction, and credit where it\u2019s due. Opinions are exactly that, opinions, and when they\u2019re grounded in something tangible, they can be debated. So, let\u2019s go through your points, because there is substance in parts of it, but the framing is doing a lot of heavy lifting. 1. Volatility Yes, MBO is volatile. It\u2019s AIM, volatility is the entry fee, not a plot twist. The same mechanism that gave you a -40% swing last week is the one that gave you +40% today. If that\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d, then the bar really has been on the floor. 2. Negative equity / working capital You\u2019ve dressed this up like a red siren, but settlement based fintech\u2019s often show negative equity because of timing windows, money in transit, float obligations, settlement cycles. It\u2019s accounting mechanics, not a death rattle. But sure, it sounds dramatic when you frame it that way. 3. Debt levels Debt to equity ratios become meaningless when equity is temporarily negative. It inflates the number into something monstrous. The real question is whether obligations are being serviced. 4. Insider ownership High insider ownership reduces liquidity, yes, but it also means the people running the business actually care about the outcome. It\u2019s not inherently negative unless you\u2019re trying to make it sound like a Bond villain subplot. 5. Regulatory exposure Fair point, but Malaysia is one of the more stable fintech regulatory environments in ASEAN. The Bangladesh corridor has more moving parts, but that\u2019s also where the upside sits. You can\u2019t have corridor based growth without corridor based regulation. That\u2019s how corridors work. 6. \u201cSpeculative nature\u201d Every early stage fintech corridor play is speculative until the rails go live. That\u2019s why 15 Feb matters; it\u2019s the moment the business moves from potential to operational. After that, speculation becomes data. What your analysis is missing entirely You\u2019ve listed the risks, fine. But investment is risk vs reward, and you\u2019ve only covered the half that lets you use dramatic wording. The reward side includes: \u2022\tthe Malaysia - Bangladesh corridor \u2022\treal time wallet disbursement \u2022\tfee share + FX income \u2022\tintegration into the bKash ecosystem \u2022\tecosystem upgrades like Pubali Bank improving the receiving rail \u2022\tregulatory approvals already secured You can\u2019t analyse MBO purely through historical financials. You analyse it through future cashflows and corridor scalability, otherwise you\u2019re just reading numbers out loud. So yes, MXD, credit where it\u2019s due. For the first time in 200+ posts, you\u2019ve produced something that can actually be discussed rather than scrolled past.",

All of this is visible in the original admission document and today\u2019s information https://www.mobilityone.com.my/v7/admission-report.html For an AIM listed fintech/payments business, or in fact any type of business this level of capital discipline is exceptionally rare, in fact I would love to see a chart which shows this type of information and statistics! According to a Grant Thornton, 75% of all funds raised by AIM companies since 2007 have been through secondary issues. I've only ever really looked at this since you mentioned the shares held by the BOD (which I've always known is very high)  so thanks for pointing that out mxd, very good spot!!",

You're posting negative crap and predictions on other share boards too. It's not like you go in share boards and predict massive rises.  You wait until you think a share has peaked and then predict it will fall.",

          "content": "It\u2019s important to note that: No revenue or earnings are expected from the new Islamic banking business in 2026, it\u2019s a long-lead, future project. Also, for the full year ended 31 December 2024, MobilityOne reported a net loss of about \u00a33.45 million after tax, meaning it did not make a profit for that year. For the first half of 2025 (six months to 30 June), it also recorded a loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million, though this was smaller than the loss in the same period the previous year. Profitability is the challenge: Costs, such as administrative expenses, cost of sales, and associated company losses, have kept the company in the red. Although what can be seen encouraging is the revenue of \u00a3230.2m, however, the company is still in the loss and that's a red flag. It's actually quite worrying that they are not in profit despite having \u00a3203M of revenue. These guys had near 20 years in the business but still failed to make a profit. For that reason I have rated this a sell. Whether that will change further down the line would depend on if they can reduce expenses and admin costs. I would also like to point out that the Islamic finance is just a conditional approval for an Islamic digital banking arm in Labuan, Malaysia. It means that the operation are mostly limited to Malaysia.",

No that is far from the reality , the fact is and this is not a opinion as I have been advised from bankers that the approval is far from guaranteed and should the receive this approval this would value the company in the region of pounds not Pennys , simply and the market cap does not represent the amount of cash . revenue that can he achieved through this approval .. So realistically if we don't get approval which could happen , then off  course we will undoubtedly crash , hence many have sold out of this basis and with large profits , some life changing money .. now us long tern holders and late arrivals like myself who bought in at 7 p , well we need a approval and I believe we will be approved , now that is my opinion and I could be wrong.. so in terms of risk vs reward .. for me its worth the risk .. hence please do your ojnw research .. and make your now decisions .. remember its your money ..",

          "content": "The bullish engulfing pattern is a two-candle pattern used in technical analysis to predict the reversal of a downtrend. It suggests that buyers are taking control of the market from sellers. Here's a breakdown of how it works: Downtrend Precedence: The pattern appears at the end of a downtrend. Two Candlesticks: It consists of two candlesticks. The first is a small bearish (red or black) candlestick. The second is a large bullish (white or green) candlestick that completely \"engulfs\" the body of the previous candle. Market Sentiment Shift: The bullish engulfing pattern indicates a short-term change in market sentiment, potentially triggered by news, events, or price adjustments. Confirmation: To confirm the reversal, traders often look for a third bullish candlestick closing above the high of the engulfing candle. This suggests sustained upward momentum",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",

MBO\u2019s operational catalysts - These are driven by the corridor infrastructure, not by a merger vote in another entity.

          "content": "There\u2019s been some confusion on the board about what constitutes meaningful near\u2011term events for MBO, so here\u2019s a clearer, verifiable breakdown of what actually matters from an operational and regulatory standpoint. The TETE AGM on 20 February relates to their own corporate timetable for a long\u2011running transaction window. It does not alter MBO\u2019s regulatory approvals, corridor readiness, or operational sequencing. These are separate entities with separate processes. For MBO specifically, the short\u2011term catalysts are operational and can be verified against prior RNS disclosures, partner statements, and regulatory approvals already granted. Receiving\u2011Side Banking Upgrade (15 February Window) The receiving\u2011side infrastructure upgrade completes on 15 February, which aligns with the operational window previously referenced by partners. This is a standard prerequisite step before a corridor moves from \u201cready\u201d to \u201cactive,\u201d ensuring settlement, reconciliation, and wallet disbursement systems are fully aligned. Corridor Activation (Operational Go\u2011Live) This is the primary near\u2011term milestone. Once the Malaysia -Bangladesh corridor is activated, the system transitions from framework to execution. What can be verified: \u2022\tRegulatory approvals on both ends have already been disclosed. \u2022\tIntegration with the receiving ecosystem (including wallet disbursement capability) has been confirmed. \u2022\tSettlement mechanics have been defined in previous communications. \u2022\tThe remaining step is operational switch\u2011on. First Settlement Cycle The first completed settlement cycle is a technical confirmation that the rails are functioning end to end. What can be verified: \u2022\tSettlement windows and float mechanics were previously outlined. \u2022\tThe infrastructure for cross border settlement is already in place. \u2022\tThis step follows immediately after activation. Initial Revenue Recognition Even modest early revenue is meaningful because it confirms the commercial model is functioning. What can be verified: \u2022\tThe revenue model (fee share + FX) has been described in prior disclosures. \u2022\tRevenue begins only once transactions are flowing. \u2022\tThis is the first hard data point the market will receive post activation. Volume Indicators and Throughput Guidance Directional commentary on expected volumes is a key short term indicator. What can be verified: \u2022\tPartner driven volumes are typically disclosed after initial operational bedding in. \u2022\tEarly adoption signals often follow shortly after go live. \u2022\tThis is standard sequencing for corridor based fintech operations. Additional Corridor or Partner Updates Once the first corridor is live, expansion becomes the natural next step. What can be verified: \u2022\tThe company has previously referenced multi corridor ambitions. \u2022\tAdditional partnerships typically follow once the first corridor is proven operationally.",

It was purely so they could take the price back down again this morning.....ON NO TRADES!!! You can see the manipulation so easily! They're playing mind games. The whole of yesterdays trades....BUYS AND SELLS COMBINED....equates to less than two thirds of my holding. So yes, I fully agree with you pal...the  share price can be manipulated on very small volume. The next news will send the price many multiples of what we're seeing at present! I'll be topping up again next week.",

I\u2019ve just gone back through a few RNSs this evening and I actually think we\u2019re due another announcement fairly soon around Mastercard Send. It\u2019s mentioned alongside bKash in the half year, so it feels like the next logical step? When you look at the recent bKash news in that context, it starts to make a lot more sense especially when you remember we\u2019re doing \u00a3230 million in revenue and still losing money. That tells you straight away the issue here isn\u2019t scale, it\u2019s margin mix. The legacy business around airtime reloads and bill payments does huge volume, but at very thin margins, and to be fair the Board has been pretty open about that. Where it gets interesting now is what\u2019s now being layered on top. bKash isn\u2019t a concept or a pilot as shared in my original post, expats sent remittances more than five million times, settled instantly via Pubali. That corridor now runs 24/7, 365. The behaviour is already there and it\u2019s trusted, it\u2019s repeat usage at scale, and as you mentioned, the working patterns and hours are very different to what most people are used to in the UK. We\u2019re not trying to invent demand here. We\u2019re plugging into an ecosystem where remittance is frequent, digital and increasingly stays inside the wallet for bills, payments and services which is exactly where fee income and FX margin live! The Board has been clear that remittance revenues will be \u201crelatively modest\u201d, and that makes total sense against a \u00a3230m revenue base. But the point isn\u2019t headline growth anymore, it\u2019s quality. At this scale, even a small improvement in blended margin has an outsized impact and roughly speaking, a 1% uplift in margin is worth north of \u00a32 million The strategy explicitly references Mastercard Send still to come. That\u2019s not name dropping or hype. it\u2019s better infrastructure with faster settlement, broader corridor reach, lower friction and better transaction velocity. You don\u2019t add that unless the volumes already justify it, and in this case we  clearly do. The real question now is whether the economics on flows we already have can be steadily improved. If they can we just need better rails on existing, and very soon expanding, transaction volumes! Bodes well for the SPAC listing!",

This hassle-free and secure service, offered by the mobile financial service (MFS) provider bKash, has earned the trust of expatriates and their families, encouraging sending remittances through legal channels, strengthening the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves. Recently, a ceremony was held at bKash\u2019s headquarters to celebrate this achievement where Pubali Bank\u2019s Managing Director and CEO Mohammad Ali and bKash\u2019s CEO Kamal Quadir, along with senior officials from both organisations were present. They highlighted the significance of this joint service and pledged to make remittance services even easier and safer for users. As a vital lifeline for the country's economy, these hard-earned remittances from expatriates are boosting the country's foreign exchange reserves and contributing to macroeconomic stability. To facilitate this, Pubali Bank and bKash have created a robust ecosystem for expatriates, to send remittances easily and securely. Currently, expatriates from 33 countries can send remittances through 11 international Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), which are settled instantly in the recipient's bKash account through Pubali Bank. Besides, recipients receive a government incentive of Tk 25 per thousand. They can easily cash out the remittance from nearby bKash agent points. Moreover, Families of the expatriates can utilise remittance to take various services through their bKash accounts, including paying for products and services, utility bills (gas, electricity, water), sending money, mobile recharge, paying educational and government fees, donations, insurance premiums, microfinance payments and many other services from the comfort of their homes. In addition to offering convenient, instant and secure remittance transfers, bKash has lowered cash-out fees. Beneficiaries can now withdraw remittances at a minimal cost of Tk 7 per thousand from approximately 2,500 ATMs of 19 leading commercial banks.

While independent of MBO, this strengthens the bKash ecosystem's liquidity, making the \"receiving\" end more attractive for MBO's customers. \u2022 User Base: With ~900,000 Bangladeshi permit holders in Malaysia, even capturing a 5\u201310% market share of this specific corridor would represent a significant volume for a company of MBO's size (Market Cap ~\u00a36m).

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

It would be nice others perspectives. ............................................ When an F-4/A (amendment to a foreign private issuer merger/exchange registration statement) is submitted to the SEC, the quickest it can generally become effective is immediately upon filing, provided the SEC has granted a request for acceleration of effectiveness. However, the practical timeline and requirements are as follows: Acceleration Request: If the amendment (F-4/A) resolves all previous SEC staff comments, the company will typically file a request for acceleration under Rule 461. The staff can declare the amendment effective shortly after filing, often within a few hours or on the same day, assuming the filing is processed. Automatic Effectiveness (No Delaying Amendment): If the F-4/A removes the \"delaying amendment\" (Rule 473) and includes specific language referencing Section 8(a), it can become effective automatically on the 20th calendar day after filing. Without Acceleration: If a new F-4/A is filed and it does not request acceleration, the 20-day waiting period generally restarts from the date of that amendment. Key Considerations: Filing Deadline: To be considered for same-day or accelerated processing, the F-4/A should generally be filed on EDGAR before 5:30 p.m. ET. Target Requirement: For F-4 business combinations, the prospectus must be sent to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting or consummation of the transaction. Disclaimer: SEC registration statement effectiveness depends on specific staff review, and timelines can vary based on the complexity of the filing and the nature of the amendments.

Fact 1 bKash has already processed 5 million inbound remittance transactions in 10 months, settled via Pubali Bank PLC, across 33 countries and 11 international MTOs, with instant wallet credit and government FX incentives so proven national scale infrastructure https://www.thedailystar.net/business/organisation-news/news/bkash-sees-50-lakh-remittance-transfers-through-pubali-bank-10 Fact 2 The bank and bKash went fully 24/7 with automated cash and liquidity management for agents and distributors. We now have always on settlement, real-time liquidity, and no banking cutoffs. Pubali is clearly acting as the core settlement and liquidity bank behind bKash. Fact 3 We confirmed our  collaboration goes live next week giving real-time disbursement into bKash wallets, wallet-to-wallet remittance, fee share plus FX income targeting 900,000 Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia .. 37% of foreign workers. At the time of the RNS, the question was whether this could scale. With bKash already settling millions of remittances via Pubali, and liquidity now running 24/7 that question is effectively answered in today\u2019s news. We ain\u2019t building new rails in Bangladesh we are plugging into an existing, regulated, alwayson digital money system that\u2019s already operating at scale. We don\u2019t need a RNS naming a settlement bank becauseCorrespondent and liquidity banks don\u2019t get headline mentions, they run the infrastructure and Pubali is already doing that job for bKash. The board\u2019s comment about near-term revenues being \u201cmodest\u201d is sensible caution and the risk profile has shifted to proven settlement at scale,24/7 liquidity, fees and FX participation, zero infrastructure rebuild.

          "content": "MXD, for the first time in over 200 posts you\u2019ve actually put something on the table that can be discussed rather than reacted to with an emoji. That\u2019s a step in the right direction, and credit where it\u2019s due. Opinions are exactly that, opinions, and when they\u2019re grounded in something tangible, they can be debated. So, let\u2019s go through your points, because there is substance in parts of it, but the framing is doing a lot of heavy lifting. 1. Volatility Yes, MBO is volatile. It\u2019s AIM, volatility is the entry fee, not a plot twist. The same mechanism that gave you a -40% swing last week is the one that gave you +40% today. If that\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d, then the bar really has been on the floor. 2. Negative equity / working capital You\u2019ve dressed this up like a red siren, but settlement based fintech\u2019s often show negative equity because of timing windows, money in transit, float obligations, settlement cycles. It\u2019s accounting mechanics, not a death rattle. But sure, it sounds dramatic when you frame it that way. 3. Debt levels Debt to equity ratios become meaningless when equity is temporarily negative. It inflates the number into something monstrous. The real question is whether obligations are being serviced. 4. Insider ownership High insider ownership reduces liquidity, yes, but it also means the people running the business actually care about the outcome. It\u2019s not inherently negative unless you\u2019re trying to make it sound like a Bond villain subplot. 5. Regulatory exposure Fair point, but Malaysia is one of the more stable fintech regulatory environments in ASEAN. The Bangladesh corridor has more moving parts, but that\u2019s also where the upside sits. You can\u2019t have corridor based growth without corridor based regulation. That\u2019s how corridors work. 6. \u201cSpeculative nature\u201d Every early stage fintech corridor play is speculative until the rails go live. That\u2019s why 15 Feb matters; it\u2019s the moment the business moves from potential to operational. After that, speculation becomes data. What your analysis is missing entirely You\u2019ve listed the risks, fine. But investment is risk vs reward, and you\u2019ve only covered the half that lets you use dramatic wording. The reward side includes: \u2022\tthe Malaysia - Bangladesh corridor \u2022\treal time wallet disbursement \u2022\tfee share + FX income \u2022\tintegration into the bKash ecosystem \u2022\tecosystem upgrades like Pubali Bank improving the receiving rail \u2022\tregulatory approvals already secured You can\u2019t analyse MBO purely through historical financials. You analyse it through future cashflows and corridor scalability, otherwise you\u2019re just reading numbers out loud. So yes, MXD, credit where it\u2019s due. For the first time in 200+ posts, you\u2019ve produced something that can actually be discussed rather than scrolled past.",

Total dilution is around 12.8% since admission Annualised dilution 0.6\u20130.7% per year Just Let that sink in for a moment Most AIM companies manage that level of dilution in 12 to 18 months, not over two decades. All of this is visible in the original admission document and today\u2019s information https://www.mobilityone.com.my/v7/admission-report.html For an AIM listed fintech/payments business, or in fact any type of business this level of capital discipline is exceptionally rare, in fact I would love to see a chart which shows this type of information and statistics! According to a Grant Thornton, 75% of all funds raised by AIM companies since 2007 have been through secondary issues. I've only ever really looked at this since you mentioned the shares held by the BOD (which I've always known is very high)  so thanks for pointing that out mxd, very good spot!!",

          "content": "It\u2019s important to note that: No revenue or earnings are expected from the new Islamic banking business in 2026, it\u2019s a long-lead, future project. Also, for the full year ended 31 December 2024, MobilityOne reported a net loss of about \u00a33.45 million after tax, meaning it did not make a profit for that year. For the first half of 2025 (six months to 30 June), it also recorded a loss after tax of \u00a31.14 million, though this was smaller than the loss in the same period the previous year. Profitability is the challenge: Costs, such as administrative expenses, cost of sales, and associated company losses, have kept the company in the red. Although what can be seen encouraging is the revenue of \u00a3230.2m, however, the company is still in the loss and that's a red flag. It's actually quite worrying that they are not in profit despite having \u00a3203M of revenue. These guys had near 20 years in the business but still failed to make a profit. For that reason I have rated this a sell. Whether that will change further down the line would depend on if they can reduce expenses and admin costs. I would also like to point out that the Islamic finance is just a conditional approval for an Islamic digital banking arm in Labuan, Malaysia. It means that the operation are mostly limited to Malaysia.",

So realistically if we don't get approval which could happen , then off  course we will undoubtedly crash , hence many have sold out of this basis and with large profits , some life changing money .. now us long tern holders and late arrivals like myself who bought in at 7 p , well we need a approval and I believe we will be approved , now that is my opinion and I could be wrong.. so in terms of risk vs reward .. for me its worth the risk .. hence please do your ojnw research .. and make your now decisions .. remember its your money ..",

It suggests that buyers are taking control of the market from sellers. Here's a breakdown of how it works: Downtrend Precedence: The pattern appears at the end of a downtrend. Two Candlesticks: It consists of two candlesticks. The first is a small bearish (red or black) candlestick. The second is a large bullish (white or green) candlestick that completely \"engulfs\" the body of the previous candle. Market Sentiment Shift: The bullish engulfing pattern indicates a short-term change in market sentiment, potentially triggered by news, events, or price adjustments. Confirmation: To confirm the reversal, traders often look for a third bullish candlestick closing above the high of the engulfing candle. This suggests sustained upward momentum",

          "content": "Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal TETE has determined that there will not be sufficient time before February 20, 2026 (its current termination date) to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of, and to consummate, a Business Combination. The Articles of Association currently provide that TETE has until the Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. TETE and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Articles of Association to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless TETE provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. While TETE is using its best efforts to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that the Extension be obtained so that, in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not able to be consummated on or before the Termination Date, TETE will have an additional amount of time to consummate a Business Combination. Without the Extension, TETE believes that there is significant risk that TETE will not, despite its best efforts, be able to complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date. If that were to occur, TETE would be precluded from completing a Business Combination and would be forced to liquidate even if TETE shareholders are otherwise in favor of consummating a Business Combination. The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing TETE additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business Combination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. TETE believes that given TETE\u2019s expenditure of time, effort and money on a Business Combination, circumstances warrant ensuring that TETE is in the best position possible to consummate a Business Combination and that it is in the best interests of TETE shareholders that TETE obtain the Extension if needed. TETE believes a Business Combination will provide significant benefits to its shareholders. .............................................................................. After reading the above, if things do overrun into the extension period (hopefully not)......surely it wont be for too long? Certainly not August? All they need to do is arrange and conduct the EGM (shareholder approval), plus consummate the Business Combination. Does anyone have any idea how long the consummation takes to complete? It can't take too long if they were hoping/expecting to complete before 20th February! Lets hope they can squeeze everything i",
