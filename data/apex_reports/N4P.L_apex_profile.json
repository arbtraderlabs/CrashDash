The programme remains on track towards key\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\nstudies planned for the first half of 2026, and to build out the commercial data to demonstrate Nuvec\u00ae's key benefits and advance Nuvec\u00ae towards clinical readiness.\nAs part of this programme, drug-loading procedures are being established to optimise reproducibility, efficiency and stability, and direct comparisons are being made with lipid nanoparticles, the current industry standard, to demonstrate the competitive benefits of Nuvec\u00ae.\nLatest studies indicate that Nuvec\u00ae nanoparticles would offer a significant commercial advantage over lipid nanoparticles (\"LNPs\"), particularly in terms of stability. This includes both the intrinsic stability of the nanoparticle itself and the stability achieved following loading with siRNA.\nAll this work is essential both for the development of N4 101, an oral anti-inflammatory product for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (\"IBD\"), and any potential partnership collaborations\nfor Nuvec\u00ae more generally,\nas it lays the foundation for any future clinical work by N4 Pharma or by partners.\n2025 highlights\nIn addition to the crucial CMAC work above, the Company has made further excellent progress towards the key objectives set out\nfollowing the April 2025 fundraising\n, focused on building out the Nuvec\u00ae data set to support future commercial outreach.\nKey achievements include:\n\u00b7\nSuccessful preclinical demonstration of oral delivery and efficacy\nusing Nuvec\u00ae in an animal model of IBD. The protection of the RNA payload by Nuvec\u00ae represents a key differentiator versus competing delivery technologies.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful targeting of Nuvec\u00ae particles\n,\ndemonstrated both in the IBD programme and in work conducted with SRI International in non-small cell lung cancer (\"NSCLC\") cells. Effective targeting is widely regarded as the 'holy grail' for pharmaceutical companies developing RNA-based therapeutics.\nAnticipated newsflow\nThe Company expects a strong flow of data-driven news in the coming months, including:\n\u00b7\nFurther comparative performance data for Nuvec\u00ae versus lipid nanoparticles, which currently dominate RNA therapeutic delivery but suffer from known drawbacks, including toxicity, limited targeting capability and manufacturing complexity.\n\u00b7\nIn vivo\nbiodistribution and further targeting data\nwill provide critical insights into where Nuvec\u00ae distributes within the body and further demonstrate how it can be directed to specific tissues.\n\u00b7\nRepeat of N4 101\nin vivo\nstudy using two siRNA to reduce inflammation\n.\n\u00b7\nIdentification of assets that N4 Pharma will look to develop itself into clinical trials, clearly positioning the Company as an RNA therapeutic company as well as having a unique delivery platform.\nIntellectual property\nThe Company has also strengthened its intellectual property position with the PCT filing of its patent application relating to its IBD programme. The patent now covers the use of Nuvec\u00ae for the delivery of dual-loaded siRNA therapies as well as combined siRNA and mRNA payloads.\nN4 Pharma has also been notified that the Japanese patent office has issued a notice to allow the grant of its patent application for the use of Nuvec\u00ae to improve the performance of viral vectors and now awaits the formal notification of this application being granted in Japan. This patent is still being prosecuted in the USA and Europe.\nNigel Theobald, Chief Executive Officer of N4 Pharma, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged by the progress being made across the Nuvec\u00ae programme and by the data emerging from our collaboration with the University of Strathclyde. The stability, targeting and oral delivery data generated to date reinforce our belief that Nuvec\u00ae has the potential to address several of the key limitations associated with lipid nanoparticles, which remain the current industry standard.\n\"N4 Pharma is building a robust, high-quality data package to support future commercial discussions. With multiple important readouts expected in the coming months, we believe Nuvec\u00ae continues to demonstrate its potential as a differentiated and commercially attractive delivery platform for RNA therapeutics and will provide the Company further opportunities to look at developing its own RNA assets in the future.\"\n- Ends -\nFor more information please contact:\nN4 Pharma plc\nNigel Theobald, CEO\nLuke Cairns, Executive Director\nSubmit your questions directly to the management team via the N4 Pharma Investor Hub\nVia N4 Pharma Investor Hub\nhttps://n4pharma.com/link/yaGp6r\nSP Angel Corporate\nFinance LLP\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nMatthew Johnson/Jen Clarke (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre/Abigail Wayne/Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Limited\nJoint Broker\nAndy Thacker\nGuy McDougall\nTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nNorthstar Communications Limited\nInvestor Relations\nSarah Hollins\nTel: +44 (0)113 730 3896\nAbout N4 Pharma\nN4 Pharma is a pre-clinical biotech company developing Nuvec\u00ae, its proprietary gene delivery system, to enable advanced therapies for cancer and other diseases.\nRNA therapeutics are set to impact the treatment of a wide range of diseases and Nuvec\u00ae has several key advantages for RNA gene delivery including the ability to deliver multiple RNA therapies in a single particle, ease of manufacturing,\nprotection of the RNA payload to allow for oral delivery, no unwanted immune response and excellent stability and storage.\nN4 Pharma is building out its preclinical data set and working towards first-in-human clinical data to support significant licensing deals for its Nuvec\u00ae platform with gene therapy partners.\nN4 Pharma's lead programme, N4 101, is an oral anti-inflammatory product for IBD which serves as a proof-of-concept programme showcasing all the benefits of the Nuvec\u00ae platform.\nFor further information on the Company visit\nwww.n4pharma.com\nor sign up at\nhttps://investors.n4pharma.com/auth/signup\n.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

During the period, \u00a33,690 of revenue was generated by the Group (30 June 2024: \u00a33,906).\nThe loss for the period was \u00a3470,216 (30 June 2024: \u00a3491,705) and in line with planned expenditure.\nThe Company's cash balance at 30 June 2025 was \u00a31,727,543 (30 June 2024: \u00a31,204,946), following a successful placing to raise gross proceeds of \u00a31,750,000 in April 2025.\nOperational update\nThe first half of the financial year has been about ensuring that the Company has the right team and finance in place to rapidly advance the Nuvec\u00ae platform with a view to securing commercial partners as quickly as possible. N4 Pharma has also continued the preclinical development of the Company's lead product, N4 101, following the first successful\nin vivo\nstudy results during the period, which confirmed that\nNuvec\u00ae has the potential to deliver an oral inflammation therapeutic for the treatment of GI disorders, including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (\"IBD\") and Ulcerative Colitis (\"UC\").\nN4 Pharma is increasingly aware of the strengths of\nNuvec\u00ae, in particular its ability to target the RNA payload to specific cells, which is a key requirement for RNA therapeutics developers, and this has directed the Company's corporate strategy to deliver maximum value for shareholders. The Company believes that the ability to specifically target certain cell types is a major differentiator compared to other delivery systems.\nThe Company's resources will be focused in the near term on expanding N4 Pharma's data to support deal-making whilst continuing to advance N4 101 as a potential clinical candidate as well as a model system to exemplify Nuvec\u00ae's key benefits. N4 Pharma is also carrying out initial work to identify further novel RNA therapeutic opportunities to expand the Company's in-house pipeline.\nThe key benefits of Nuvec\u00ae as a delivery platform are:\n\u00b7\nIts unique, patented spiky surface structure allows the loading of both DNA and RNA drugs and protects them from degradation;\n\u00b7\nIt is relatively straightforward to manufacture and scale up;\n\u00b7\nIt can be targeted to specific cells such as cancer and immune cells to reduce toxicities and broaden the range of applications of nucleic acid therapies;\n\u00b7\nIn contrast to other delivery options such as viral vectors and lipid nanoparticles, which are known to evoke an immune response, the inert nature of Nuvec\u00ae nano-silica particles dramatically reduces immunogenicity at the concentrations used\n;\n\u00b7\nIt is a straightforward process to load multiple siRNAs onto the same nanoparticle for combination therapies;\n\u00b7\nHigh loading capacity, efficient cellular uptake and endosomal release enables delivery of large numbers of RNA copies into each cell; and\n\u00b7\nIts protective capabilities allow for oral delivery of nucleic acid therapies.\nLead preclinical programme - N4 101, a potential oral treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\nFollowing the successful completion of\nin vitro\nprofiling in December 2024, during the period under review, the Company completed its first\nin vivo\nstudy using an industry-standard mouse model of IBD. The study explored the therapeutic potential of orally administered Nuvec\u00ae particles loaded with siRNA alone and combined with mRNA.\nOver a nine-day dosing period, mice with chemically induced acute IBD received single (siRNA) or dual (siRNA and mRNA) Nuvec\u00ae-loaded formulations with the Nuvec\u00ae particles modified to specifically target cells involved in gut inflammation. Samples were collected for analysis on day 15.\nKey highlights from the study included:\n\u00b7\nReduction in inflammation:\nboth single and\ndual-loaded Nuvec\u00ae particles demonstrated marked improvements compared with controls across all key indicators of colitis, including Disease Activity Index (DAI), colon length, and body weight loss.\n\u00b7\nMarked increase in efficacy achieved with targeting:\nboth the single and dual loaded Nuvec\u00ae combined with a targeting agent performed better and showed an even greater reduction in the inflammatory marker TNF alpha than the untargeted therapies.\n\u00b7\nSustained therapeutic effect:\nsix days after the final administration, both single and dual-loaded targeted Nuvec\u00ae particles showed a near complete reduction in TNF alpha levels in intestinal tissues.\n\u00b7\nEffective oral delivery:\nthe study also provides clear\nin vivo\nevidence that Nuvec\u00ae particles successfully deliver therapeutic nucleic acid cargos (siRNA and mRNA) to the gut via oral administration, resulting in the sustained anti-inflammatory effects observed.\nN4 Pharma believes the market for such an oral product to treat GI inflammation to be significant. Current therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, are sub-optimal, requiring regular, painful injections which can result in reduced patient compliance. Injectable products to treat these disorders represented 78% of a market worth US\n$20.4bn in 2023 and is expected to grow by a CAGR of 3.9% to over US$27.6bn by 2030\u00b9\n.\nThe ability to deliver a medication orally targeting the same mechanism as the antibody-based therapeutics would represent a preferable form of treatment. With 5 million sufferers of the two main types of IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), there is huge potential for a product to address this market and it is estimated that the oral segment of this market could be worth US$7bn by 2030.\nThere is a significant market opportunity for such a product, mainly as an oral substitute for the largest sector already of TNF inhibitors and to compete with the inhibitor drugs being developed. If such a product could take 50% share of the existing TNF inhibitor market and 25% of the oral market, it would potentially be worth US$12bn. Even achieving just 10% of this at US$1.2bn would give the product significant potential.\n(\u00b9 2023 Grand View Research, Inc. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment. Market Analysis, 2018-2030).\nTo date, the Company has worked closely with the University of Queensland (\"UQ\"), who were the original inventors of the Nuvec\u00ae technology. With the emphasis now on creating a data package more geared towards commercial collaborations the Company is migrating the ongoing work to a specialist contract research organisation, CMAC at Strathclyde University.\nThe focus of the work at CMAC over the next six to nine months is to:\n\u00b7\ndevelop a scalable and reproducible dual siRNA loading process;\n\u00b7\nfully characterise the loaded nanoparticles\n(physicochemical, cell-based);\n\u00b7\nassess different surface coatings;\n\u00b7\ngenerate stability data;\n\u00b7\nconduct an oral biodistribution study;\n\u00b7\ngenerate comparisons with competitive platforms such as lipid nanoparticles; and\n\u00b7\nexplore other targeting moieties.\nTargeting cells in Oncology\nAs recently announced, following the successful work with SRI combining its targeting molecules with Nuvec\u00ae to successfully deliver\ntherapeutic RNA (\"siRNA\") payloads to non-small cell lung cancer cells the Company is developing a work programme to explore novel siRNA oncology targeting.\nThe key results from the SRI work showed:\n\u00b7\nPrecision targeting achieved\n: Nuvec\u00ae particles were modified with a molecule binding to \u03b1v\u03b26 - a protein found at high levels in epithelial cancers such as lung, breast, prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.\n\u00b7\nSelective uptake confirmed\n: siRNA payloads were successfully delivered only by the modified Nuvec\u00ae particles, with no uptake in controls, demonstrating that Nuvec\u00ae can be directed to specific cell types.\n\u00b7\nBroader validation of Nuvec\u00ae\n: The findings strengthen the platform's potential as a differentiated delivery system for RNA therapeutics across multiple disease areas.\nTargeting RNA therapies to specific cells and tissues to maximise efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity is highly sought after by nucleic acid therapeutics developers and is challenging to achieve with established RNA delivery methods.\nThe ability to demonstrate the successful targeting of Nuvec\u00ae to cancer cells and immune cells, as the Company is doing in its lead, N4 101, programme, is something we believe sets Nuvec\u00ae apart from other delivery systems and, as N4 Pharma's data package increases, will attract partners in these multi-billion dollar sectors.\nLegacy programme - Liptide\u00ae Glaucoma product, ECP105\nN4 Pharma has a legacy siRNA programme (ECP105) which is designed to be a simple and effective anti-fibrotic therapeutic approach which maximises and increases surgical success in the treatment of Glaucoma by reducing post-surgical scarring whilst avoiding exposing patients to the risk of cytotoxic medication. ECP105 uses Liptide\u00ae as a delivery system and contains a siRNA sequence to silence the fibrotic gene MRTF-B without cytotoxic side effects. The programme is being developed by Nanogenics Limited (\"Nanogenics\"), the Company's 71% owned subsidiary.\nAs previously announced, the Company submitted an application for orphan drug designation in respect of ECP105 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), for the prevention of scarring following glaucoma surgery and this process is still ongoing. However, additional work is required, and the Company is awaiting quotes and scopes of work for this work to advance ECP105. When the ongoing costs of the ECP105 programme are known, the Board will take a view as to which direction would be most beneficial for its interest in Nanogenics.\nBoard and management\nIn January 2025, David Templeton retired and stepped down from the Board. As stated at the time, on behalf of all Directors, the Company would like to thank him for his contributions over the years and wish him well for the future.\nAt the same time, the Company welcomed Dr Alastair Smith to the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Alastair was the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Avacta Group plc (\"Avacta\"), an AIM-quoted biotech company established as a spin-out from Leeds University in 2005 and listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM market in 2006.\nOver his tenure, Avacta grew into a leading biotech company comprising two divisions: a clinical-stage oncology drug company advancing its proprietary pre|CISIONTM\u00a0tumour targeting platform\u00a0and a diagnostics business executing an M&A-led growth strategy in Europe focused on healthcare professionals.\nPost period end, in July 2025, the Company appointed Edward Wardle as a Non-Executive Director representing the interests of Northern Standard Limited, which became our largest shareholder following the placing in April 2025.\nAs announced on 27 May 2025, the Company's newly configured Board is now supported by the formation of a Senior Leadership Team, reporting to Nigel Theobald, Chief Executive Officer,\ncomprising leading expert consultants in drug development and research, commercial strategy and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The team is made up as follows:\nDr Fiona McLaughlin - Head of Research and Development\nDr Fiona McLaughlin is a highly experienced oncology drug developer and independent consultant, bringing over 25 years of experience in research and translational drug development in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, having led teams from early research through to clinical development. Fiona started her career at GSK and has subsequently held leadership positions in multiple biotech companies, including CSO of Avacta Therapeutics, VP New Opportunities at Algeta ASA (now Bayer), VP Translational Research at Antisoma plc and Director of Pre-clinical Development at BTG plc (now part of Boston Scientific). She is also a non-executive director of Hox Therapeutics.\nFiona received a PhD from the Haematology Department at Cambridge University and has a BSc in Biochemistry from Glasgow University.\nMark Edbrooke - Head of Strategy\nMark Edbrooke, PhD\u00a0is an independent scientific consultant with a broad experience in pharmaceutical research and\u00a0development. During 25 years at GlaxoSmithKline, he ran\u00a0a transnational functional genomics department and then set up\u00a0and led GSK's therapeutic nucleic acid unit. He then joined\u00a0AstraZeneca's Oncology Division for three years, working with Ionis and Moderna. Mark currently has a portfolio of clients, including UK and US-based investment companies,\u00a0UK and\u00a0European-based universities\u00a0and small\u00a0biotechs, including being Head of Translational Research at\u00a0Argonaute RNA Ltd. and on the Senior Advisory Board for Deep Genomics.\nDr Simon Bennett - Commercial Director\nDr Simon Bennett is an independent consultant with over 28 years of experience in the bio-pharma industry. Over the last 15 years, Simon has worked with more than 70 clients of all sizes, from technology startups to Big Pharma, largely supporting business development and licensing, as well as technology scouting and fundraising. Simon has been involved in over 80 commercial deals and mentors and advises early-stage businesses and management teams, primarily in specialty pharma and biotech. Before moving into industry in 1997, Simon was a Wellcome Trust Research Fellow at the University of Oxford.\nDr Margaret Courtney - Head of Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC)\nDr Margaret Courtney is an independent consultant with over 25 years of experience in transitioning active substances and drug products from the research laboratory into clinical studies and commercialisation. Margaret has worked in management positions in small biotech companies to large pharmaceutical organisations and following on from her pharmacy degree and doctoral studies, has developed specific expertise in drug delivery systems. Currently, she is working with a range of clients and providing CMC strategic advice as well as selection and management of contract organisations.\nOutlook and strategy\nThe commercial potential for a superior RNA delivery platform that could be widely adopted in the industry is very significant. The key benefits of the Nuvec\u00ae platform have been validated by a number of historical studies and an extremely experienced drug development team has now been put in place to complete this process and populate a commercial data room to support deal-making in the near term. Licensing deals with third-party RNA drug developers is a major value inflection point for the Company and remains a key objective.\nDevelopment of in-house RNA therapeutic candidates, differentiated by use of the Nuvec\u00ae platform, offers an opportunity to grow significant shareholder value beyond platform deals and the team is therefore advancing its lead programme, N4 101, a targeted treatment for IBD, by using it as a model system in the ongoing studies. N4 Pharma's recent success with SRI demonstrates a second targeting application, in this case non-small cell lung cancer cells. The Company expects the ability to target RNA therapeutics to be a key driver in N4 Pharma's conversations with potential license partners.\nThe Board strongly believes that the greatest return for shareholders will be delivered by a strong focus on the Nuvec\u00ae platform to deliver validation through commercial partnerships and grow longer-term value through its in-house pipeline.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of N4 Pharma's shareholders for their continued support and look forward to providing further updates on the Company's progress.\nChris Britten\nChairman\n25 September 2025\nCondensed Consolidated Interim Statement of Comprehensive Income (unaudited) for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nSix months to 30 June 2025\nSix months to 30 June 2024\nTwelve months to 31 December 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n3,690\n3,906\n7,282\nGross profit\n3,690\n3,906\n7,282\nExpenses\nResearch and development costs\n(67,316)\n(114,030)\n(390,387)\nGeneral and administration costs\n(406,590)\n(379,924)\n(837,996)\nOperating loss for the period\n(470,216)\n(490,048)\n(1,221,101)\nFinance (expenditure)/income\n-\n(1,657)\n-\nLoss for the period before tax\n(470,216)\n(491,705)\n(1,221,101)\nTaxation\n(31,379)\n-\n101,112\nLoss for the period after tax\n(501,595)\n(491,705)\n(1,119,989)\nOther comprehensive income net of tax\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(501,595)\n(491,705)\n(1,119,989)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period is attributable to:\nEquity owners of N4 Pharma Plc\n(498,550)\n(454,867)\n(1,058,622)\nNon-controlling interest\n(3,045)\n(36,838)\n(61,367)\n(501,595)\n(491,705)\n(1,119,989)\nLoss per share attributable to owners of the parent\nWeighted average number of shares:\nBasic\n576,550,109\n285,395,734\n340,386,906\nDiluted\n576,550,109\n285,395,734\n340,881,486\nBasic loss per share\n(0.09p)\n(0.16p)\n(0.31p)\nDiluted loss per share\n(0.09p)\n(0.16p)\n(0.31p)\nAll activities derive from continuing operations.\nThe notes below form an integral part of these financial statements.\nCondensed Consolidated Interim Statement of Financial Position (unaudited) as at 30 June 2025\nNotes\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nGoodwill\n-\n61,210\n-\n-\n61,210\n-\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n118,113\n69,021\n149,797\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,727,543\n1,204,946\n625,972\n1,845,656\n1,273,967\n775,769\nTotal Assets\n1,845,656\n1,335,177\n775,769\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n(28,263)\n(11,613)\n(28,796)\nAccruals and deferred income\n(50,104)\n(44,428)\n(95,571)\nTotal liabilities\n(78,367)\n(56,041)\n(124,367)\nNet current assets\n1,767,289\n1,217,926\n651,402\nNet Assets\n1,767,289\n1,279,136\n651,402\nEquity\nShare capital\n4\n11,599,946\n9,849,946\n9,849,946\nShare premium\n5\n14,736,767\n14,940,829\n14,940,829\nShare option reserve\n6\n186,319\n114,225\n114,775\nReverse acquisition reserve\n5\n(14,138,244)\n(14,138,244)\n(14,138,244)\nMerger relief reserve\n5\n279,347\n279,347\n279,347\nRetained earnings\n(10,897,556)\n(9,796,134)\n(10,399,006)\nNon-controlling interest\n9\n710\n29,167\n3,775\nTotal Equity\n1,767,289\n1,279,136\n651,402\nThe notes below form an integral part of these financial statements.\nCondensed Consolidated Interim Statement of Changes in Equity (unaudited) for the six months ended 30 June 2025\n(i) Six months ended 30 June 2025 -

Corporate Information\nN4 Pharma Plc (the \"Company\"), is the holding Company for N4 Pharma UK Limited (\"N4 UK\"), and Nanogenics Limited (\"Nanogenics\"), and together form the group (the \"Group\"). N4 Pharma UK Limited is a specialist pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of mesoparticulate silica delivery systems to improve the cellular delivery and potency of vaccines.\nNanogenics is a specialist pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of a Liptide platform to deliver a proprietary siRNA sequence to silence a fibrotic gene.\nThe Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 6 July 1979 as a public limited company and its shares are admitted to trading on AIM (LSE: N4P). With effect from 15 May 2025 the Company's registered office was changed from 6th Floor, 60 Gracechurch Street, London, EC3V 0HR to C/o Arch Law Limited, Huckletree Bishopsgate, 8 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4BQ.\nThe Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards and applied to the Company Accounts in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements are presented in Great British Pounds (\"GBP\" or \"\u00a3\"), rounded to the nearest \u00a3.\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Accounting Policies\nAdoption of New and Revised International Financial Reporting Standards\nThere are no new standards or amendments effective in the period ended 30 June 2025 which have had a material impact.\nBasis of Preparation:\nThe Group's condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\nThe annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are unaudited. In the opinion of the Directors, the condensed consolidated interim financial information presents fairly the financial position, and results from operations and cash flows for the period.\nThese Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern.\nThe Group prepares regular business forecasts and monitors its projected cash flows, which are reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are adjusted for reasonable sensitivities that address the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed, thus creating a number of different scenarios for the Board to challenge. In those cases, where scenarios deplete the Group's cash resources too rapidly, consideration is given to the potential actions available to management to mitigate the impact of one or more of these sensitivities, in particular the discretionary nature of costs incurred by the Group, in order to ensure the continued availability of funds.\nBasis of Consolidation:\nThe Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the Company together with the entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), N4 UK and Nanogenics.\nThe Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared as a result of the consolidation of the Company, N4 UK and Nanogenics, for the comparative six month period ended 30 June 2024 and the comparative twelve month period to 31 December 2024 and the current six month period ended 30 June 2025.\nAll intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated in the Group's financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\nSignificant Accounting Policies:\nThe Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for the following items, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the United Kingdom:\n\u2022 Share-based payments related to investment acquisition are measured at fair value shown in the Merger Reserve.\n\u2022 Share-based payments related to employee costs are measured at fair value at the date of grant shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\u2022 Share-based payments related to share issue costs are measured at fair value at the date of grant shown in Share Premium.\n\u2022 The associated Share Options and Warrants are measured at fair value at the date of grant using the Black Scholes model (see note 6).\nAll accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the Annual Report and there have been no amendments or changes in accounting policies during the period.\nSegmental reporting:\nThe Group operated in one business segment, that of the development and commercialisation of medicines via its delivery system called Nuvec\u00ae and its liptide platform called ECP105.\nThe Directors consider that there are no identifiable business segments that are subject to risks and returns different to the core business. The information reported to the Directors, for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group.\nSeasonality\nThe nature of the business is not deemed to be impacted by seasonal fluctuations and as such performance is expected to be consistent.\n3. Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, the Directors have decided the following estimates and assumptions are material to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognised in the condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.\nCritical judgements\nResearch and development expenditure\nThe key judgements surrounding the Research & Development expenditure is whether the expenditure meets the criteria for capitalisation. Expenditure will only be capitalised when the recognition criteria is met and is otherwise written off to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The recognition criteria include the identification of a clearly defined project with separately identifiable expenditure where the outcome of the project, in terms of its technical feasibility and commercial viability, can be measured or assessed with reasonable certainty and that sufficient resources exist to complete a profitable project. In the event that these criteria are met, and it is probable that future economic benefit attributable to the product will flow to the Group, then the expenditure will be capitalised.\n4. Share Capital\nAllotted, called up and fully paid\n30 June 2025 (Unaudited)\n30 June 2024 (Unaudited)\n31 Dec 2024 (Audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n832,280,349 Ordinary Shares of 0.4p each (30 June 2024: 394,780,349 and 31 December 2024: 394,780,349 Ordinary shares of 0.4p each)\n3,329,121\n1,579,121\n1,579,121\n137,674,431 Deferred Shares of 4p each\n5,506,977\n5,506,977\n5,506,977\n279,176,540 Deferred Shares of 0.99p each\n2,763,848\n2,763,848\n2,763,848\n11,599,946\n9,849,946\n9,849,946\nAll ordinary shares rank equally in all respects, including for dividends, shareholder attendance and voting rights at meetings, on a return of capital and in a winding-up.\nDuring the period 247,500,000 new ordinary shares of 0,4p each were issued through a placing and 190,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.4p each were issued through a subscription in April 2025 at a share price of 0.4p per share generating gross proceeds of \u00a31,750,000.\nThe 137,674,431 deferred shares of 4p, have no right to dividends nor do the holders thereof have the right to receive notice of or to attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company. On a return of capital or on a winding up of the Company, the holders of the deferred shares shall only be entitled to receive the amount paid up on such shares after the holders of the ordinary shares have received their return on capital.\nThe 279,176,540 deferred shares of 0.99p shall be entitled to receive a special dividend, which is payable upon the repayment to the Company of any amount owed under certain loan agreements, after which the Company shall, in priority to any distribution to any other class of share, pay to the holders of the Special Deferred Shares an aggregate amount equal to the amount repaid pro rata according to the number of such shares paid up as to their nominal value held by each shareholder. They shall be entitled to no other distribution save for a special dividend and shall not be entitled to receive notice of or attend or vote at a general meeting of the Company.\nOn a return of capital on a winding up of the Company, they shall only be entitled to receive the amount paid up on such shares up to a maximum of 0.99 pence per share after the holders of the Ordinary Shares and the Deferred Shares have received their return on capital.\n5. Reserves\nMerger relief reserve\nThe merger relief reserve arose on the Company's acquisition of N4 UK and consists of both the consideration shares and deferred consideration amounting to \u00a3279,347. There is no legal share premium on the shares issued as consideration as section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, which deals with merger relief, applies in respect of the acquisition.\nReverse acquisition reserve\nThe reverse acquisition reserve arises due to the elimination of the Company's investment in N4 UK. Since the shareholder in N4 UK became a shareholder of the Company, the acquisition is accounted for as though the legal acquiree (N4 UK) is the accounting acquirer.\nShare premium reserve\nThe share premium reserve comprises the excess amount received on the issue of ordinary shares by the Company in excess of their nominal value less issue costs\n.\nShare option reserve\nThe share option reserve comprises the fair value of options and warrants granted, less the fair value of lapsed and expired options and warrants.\nRetained earnings\nRetained earnings comprises of accumulated results to date.\n6. Share-based Payments and Share Option Reserve\nOptions\nThe Company has the ability to issue options to Directors to compensate them for services rendered and incentivise them to add value to the Group's longer-term share value. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group's estimate of the number of shares that will vest.\nThe vesting period is defined as the period in which the options are unable to be exercised. The period commences on the date the options are issued. For the options to vest, the holder must remain an employee of the Group throughout the vesting period. Once the vesting period is complete the options may be exercised on any date up to the lapse date.\nCancellations of equity instruments are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised in full immediately.\nFair value is measured using a Black Scholes pricing model. The key assumptions used in the model at the grant date were adjusted based on management's best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.\nAs at 30 June 2025, there were 26,329,370 (30 June 2024: 7,046,513, 31 December 2024: 22,046,513) options in existence over ordinary shares of the Company.

Options do not confer any voting rights on the holder.\nAn amount of \u00a32,982 has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in the Share Option Reserve in relation to the share options (30 June 2024: \u00a3nil, 31 December 2024: \u00a3550)\nAn amount of \u00a311,370 related to expired share options has been derecognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in the Share Option Reserve in relation to the share options (30 June 2024: \u00a3nil, 31 December 2024: \u00a3nil).\nThe aggregate fair value of the share options in issue as at 30 June 2025 was \u00a387,554 (30 June 2024: \u00a395,392, December 2024: \u00a395,941).\nWarrants\nAs part of the placing in April 2025 which raised \u00a31,750,000 before fees and expenses, the Company issued 87,500,000 warrants at an exercise price of 0.4p per warrant to the Company's broker on the transaction as part of their fees.\nThe warrants entitle holders to subscribe for new ordinary shares at any time in the period of\n60 months\nfollowing the grant of the warrants. The expiry date for the warrants is 4 April 2030.\nFair value is measured using a Black Scholes pricing model.\nAn amount of \u00a379,932 has been recognised in the Share Premium and in the Share Option Reserve in relation to the warrants (30 June 2024: \u00a36,840, 31 December 2024: \u00a36,840).\nThe number of warrants exercisable at 30 June 2025 end was 98,222,000 (30 June 2024: 10,722,000, December 2024: 10,722,000).\n7. Earnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss after tax attributable (excluding the deemed cost of acquisition) to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potential dilutive shares, namely share options and warrants which could be bought for less than market price.\n8.

Following detailed additional analysis, the resulting data are now shaping a new scope of work focused on utilising\nNuvec\u00ae\nfor targeted treatments in oncology.\nThe Company's collaboration\ncombined\nSRI's targeting molecules with Nuvec\u00ae\nsuccessfully delivering\ntherapeutic RNA (\"siRNA\") payloads to specific cell types, specifically non-small cell lung cancer cells.\nKey results:\n\u00b7\nPrecision targeting achieved\n: Nuvec\u00ae particles were functionalised with a targeting molecule binding to a cell surface adhesion molecule (\u03b1v\u03b26) - a protein found at high levels in epithelial cancers such as lung, breast, prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinomas\n\u00b7\nSelective uptake confirmed\n: siRNA payloads were successfully delivered and active only by the targeted Nuvec\u00ae particles compared to untargeted Nuvec\u00ae, demonstrating that Nuvec\u00ae can be directed to specific cell types\n\u00b7\nBroader validation of Nuvec\u00ae\n: The findings strengthen the platform's potential as a differentiated delivery system for RNA therapeutics across multiple disease areas, including cancers of high unmet need such as lung and pancreatic cancers\nThe global RNA therapeutics market was valued at $13.7 billion in 2023 and is forecast to reach $18.0 billion by 2028. Challenges associated with the manufacturing and targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics are known to impact this market growth.\nTargeting RNA therapies to specific cells and tissues to maximise efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity is a holy grail for nucleic acid therapeutics developers and is challenging to achieve with established RNA delivery methods.\nIn parallel to the successful targeting of Nuvec\u00ae particles to cancer cells in collaboration with SRI, N4 Pharma has also demonstrated targeting of Nuvec\u00ae to immune cells using mannose modification in its lead programme, N4 101, which is designed to be an orally delivered treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.\nNigel Theobold, Chief Executive Officer of N4 Pharma, commented:\n\"Targeting RNA therapies to particular cell types is highly sought after by companies developing RNA therapeutics. We have now demonstrated Nuvec\u00ae's ability to do this in multiple systems, which we believe sets it apart from other RNA delivery methods.\n\"These recent data from our collaboration with SRI are particularly exciting because they represent the first example of the use of Nuvec\u00ae for the potential treatment of some of the most common and life-threatening cancers.\n\"N4 Pharma raised capital earlier this year to build out the data to support the key performance claims of Nuvec\u00ae: simultaneous delivery of multiple RNAs; targeting of specific cell types; oral delivery; low immunogenicity; stability; and simple manufacturing. These data generated with SRI are a significant step forward in that process, because of the high demand for targeted therapies to support deal-making and building our own differentiated RNA therapeutics pipeline.\"\n- Ends -\nFor more information please contact:\nN4 Pharma plc\nNigel Theobald, CEO\nLuke Cairns, Executive Director\nSubmit your questions directly to the management team via the N4 Pharma Investor Hub\nVia N4 Pharma Investor Hub:\ninvestors.n4pharma.com\nhttps://n4pharma.com/link/P2z1YP\nSP Angel Corporate\nFinance LLP\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nMatthew Johnson/Jen Clarke (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre/Abigail Wayne/Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3470 0470\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Limited\nJoint Broker\nAndy Thacker\nJames Pope\nTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nNorthstar Communications Limited\nInvestor Relations\nSarah Hollins\nTel: +44 (0)113 730 3896\nAbout N4 Pharma\nN4 Pharma is a pre-clinical biotech company developing Nuvec\u00ae, its proprietary gene delivery system, to enable advanced therapies for cancer and other diseases.\nRNA therapeutics are set to impact the treatment of a wide range of diseases and Nuvec\u00ae has several key advantages for RNA gene delivery including the ability to deliver multiple RNA therapies in a single particle, ease of manufacturing, protection of the RNA payload to allow for oral delivery, no unwanted immune response and excellent stability and storage.\nN4 Pharma is building out its preclinical data set and working towards first-in-human clinical data to support significant licensing deals for its Nuvec\u00ae platform with gene therapy partners.\nN4 Pharma's lead programme, N4 101, is an oral anti-inflammatory product for IBD which serves as a proof-of-concept programme showcasing all the benefits of the Nuvec\u00ae platform.\nFor further information on the Company visit\nwww.n4pharma.com\nor sign up at\nhttps://investors.n4pharma.com/auth/signup\n.\nAbout SRI\nFor further information on SRI visit:\nhttps://www.sri.com/\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
