Sohin Genetics will commercially promote and market CARDIO inCode-Score in the Mexican market including training, sample handling and ordering via the GENinCode 'SITAB' international reporting system.

The test has been designed and optimized for population-based risk prediction and primary prevention of heart disease and\nis being made\navailable at affordable pricing to international healthcare systems.\nBy integrating CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae into existing clinical pathways, healthcare providers can more accurately identify individuals at heightened 'lifetime risk' of heart disease and personalise treatment and prevention strategies. This preventive approach reduces the incidence of severe cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, and mitigates the economic costs associated with long-term heart disease care. It represents a significant step to improving public health outcomes and particularly in addressing the global burden of cardiovascular disease.\nMatthew Walls, GENinCode Chief Executive Officer said; \"\nWe are delighted to announce this latest distribution agreement with Sohin Genetics to sell CARDIO inCode-Score in Mexico.

In the UK, it is the most common form of death and disability, with approximately 2.3 million people living with the condition2.\nCHD occurs when the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become narrowed by build-up of fatty materials (cholesterol and other lipids) which give rise to what is commonly known as atherosclerosis or heart disease. Atherosclerosis restricts blood flow to the heart causing symptoms like angina (chest pain) with increasing atherosclerosis burden giving rise to heart attack (or ischemic stroke) if the artery becomes completely blocked by a blood clot.\n1.\nWorld Health Organisation -\nwww.who.int\n- The leading causes of death\n2.\nBritish Heart Foundation -\nwww.bhf.org.uk\n- Statistics\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

JACC: Advances, a medical journal which is part of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), specifically focuses on the latest research in cardiovascular medicine including new treatments, technologies and scientific discoveries in Cardiology leading to better clinical practices in the medical field.\nThe peer-reviewed study1., titled\n\"Joint Consideration of LDL-C and Polygenic Risk for Coronary Heart Disease Risk Assessment\"\n, was conducted by researchers at Kaiser Permanente's Department of Research and Department of Cardiology in San Francisco, California, USA.\nStudy Overview\nThe Kaiser Permanente study followed over 47,000 individuals of diverse ancestry for 14 years, analysing the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and polygenic risk for coronary heart disease. Participants were assessed for the incidence of CHD events including myocardial infarction (heart attack).\nThe CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae PRS was used to quantify each participant's inherited risk of CHD based on genetic variation across the genome. The study examined whether the effect of LDL-cholesterol on CHD risk was modified by an individual's underlying genetic risk.\nKey Findings\nThe results demonstrated that genetic risk significantly influences the relationship between LDL-cholesterol and coronary heart disease, with the combination of elevated LDL-C and high PRS conferring substantially greater risk.\n\u00b7\nIndividuals with high polygenic risk experienced a 75% increase in CHD risk at LDL-C levels as low as 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L)\n(Hazard Ratio: 1.75)\n.\n\u00b7\nAt LDL-C levels of 130-160 mg/dL (3.4 - 4.1 mmol/L), risk increased more than twofold (HR: 2.1).\n\u00b7\nThe combination of a high PRS and LDL-C of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher was associated with a greater than 3.5-fold increase in CHD risk, comparable to the risk observed in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a well-established genetic condition conferring very high cardiovascular risk.\nThese findings confirm that polygenic risk acts as a powerful modifier of LDL-cholesterol-related CHD risk, supporting its use in clinical decision-making and preventive care.\nClinical and Preventive Implications\nThis study underscores the critical role that integrating genetic data with clinical assessments can play in revolutionising cardiovascular risk stratification and prevention and guide earlier intervention in at-risk populations.\nIndividuals with high genetic risk may benefit from more proactive lipid management and lifestyle or therapeutic intervention, even at LDL-C levels traditionally considered low or moderate.\nBy integrating polygenic risk assessment into existing clinical pathways, healthcare providers can more accurately identify individuals at heightened lifetime risk of CHD and personalise prevention strategies. This can also reduce the incidence of severe cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, and potentially mitigate the economic costs associated with long-term heart disease care. This approach can be seen as a significant step toward improving public health outcomes, particularly in addressing the global burden of cardiovascular disease.\nDr. Richard Kovacs, Q.E. and Sally Russell Professor of Cardiology at the Indiana University School of Medicine and Chief Medical Officer of the American College of Cardiology and Past President of the American College of Cardiology said:\n\"\nThese results provide further compelling clinical evidence for the inclusion of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in conjunction with clinical risk for improved risk assessment of CHD. The polygenic risk score is especially important in relation to patients clinically classified at borderline/intermediate risk and younger patients with a family history of CHD. The recent scientific statements and acknowledgment of the value of PRS by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association is also welcome.\"\n1. -\nhttps://share.google/nQwFO73QgGTiRqK45\nNotes to Editors\n\u00b7\nHazard Ratio (HR)\nrefers to the measure of relative risk over time. For example, an HR of 2.0 indicates that an event (such as CHD) is twice as likely to occur in one group compared to another.\n\u00b7\nLDL-cholesterol (LDL-C)\nis commonly referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol and is a well-established modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease.\n\u00b7\nThe\nJournal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): Advances\nis a leading peer-reviewed journal publishing high-quality cardiovascular research.\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nEnquiries:\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Sciences Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward (Corporate Broking)\nDale Bellis / Michael Johnson (Sales)\nWalbrook PR Limited\nAnna Dunphy / Marcus Ulker\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\ngenincode@walbrookpr.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
