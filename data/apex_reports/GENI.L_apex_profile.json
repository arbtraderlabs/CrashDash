PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT AMOUNTS TO A FINANCIAL PROMOTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 21 OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT 2000 (\"FSMA\") AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY WINTERFLOOD SECURITIES LIMITED WHICH IS AUTHORISED AND REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FRN 141455).\n21 January 2026\nGENinCode Plc\n(\"\nGENinCode\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nWRAP Retail Offer for up to \u00a3500,000\nGENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease\n(\"\nCVD\n\") and the early detection\nof ovarian cancer, is pleased to announce a retail offer via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (\"\nWRAP\n\") to raise up to \u00a3500,000 (the \"\nWRAP Retail Offer\n\") through the issue of new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the capital\nof\nthe Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\"). Under the WRAP Retail Offer up to 50,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nWRAP Retail Offer Shares\n\") will be made available at a price of 1 pence per share.\nIn addition to the WRAP Retail Offer and as announced 21 January 2026, the Company is also proposing a placing and subscription of new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nPlacing Shares\n\" and \"\nSubscription Shares\n\" and together with the WRAP Retail Offer Shares, the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") to raise a minimum of \u00a33.5 million (before expenses) through a bookbuild process (the \"\nPlacing\n\") and subscription (the \"\nSubscription\n\") at a price of 1 pence per New Ordinary Share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\"). The Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 47.4 per cent. to the mid-market closing price of an Ordinary Share on 20 January 2026 (being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement). The issue price of the WRAP Retail Offer Shares is equal to the Issue Price.\nA separate announcement has been made regarding the Placing and its terms and sets out the reasons for the Placing and use of proceeds. The proceeds of the WRAP Retail Offer will be utilised in the same way as the proceeds of the Placing.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the WRAP Retail Offer is not part of the Placing. Completion of the WRAP Retail Offer is conditional, inter alia, upon the completion of the Placing but completion of the Placing is not conditional on the completion of the WRAP Retail Offer.\nThe issue of the Retail Offer Shares is conditional upon, inter alia, the approval of certain resolutions to be put to shareholders of GENinCode at a general meeting, which is expected to be held on 9 February 2026.\nThe WRAP Retail Offer and the Placing are conditional on the New Ordinary Shares being admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is anticipated that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares will commence on AIM at 8:00 a.m. on 11 February 2026.\nWRAP Retail Offer\nThe Company values its retail shareholder base and believes that it is appropriate to provide both new and existing retail shareholders in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in the WRAP Retail Offer.\nTherefore, the Company is making the WRAP Retail Offer open to eligible investors in the United Kingdom, being new or existing shareholders of GENinCode, following release of this announcement and through certain financial intermediaries.\nA number of retail platforms are able to access the WRAP Retail Offer. Non-holders or existing shareholders wishing to subscribe for Retail Offer Shares should contact their broker or wealth manager who will confirm if they are participating in the Retail Offer.\nRetail brokers wishing to participate in the Retail Offer on behalf of eligible retail investors, should contact WRAP@winterflood.com.\nThe Retail Offer\nis expected to close at 12.00 p.m. on 26 January 2026. Eligible retail investors should note that financial intermediaries may have earlier closing times.\nThe result of the Retail Offer is expected to be announced by the Company on or around\n26 January\n2026.\nTo be eligible to participate in the Retail Offer, applicants must be a customer of a participating intermediary including individuals aged 18 years or over, companies and other bodies corporate, partnerships, trusts, associations and other unincorporated organisations.\nThere is a minimum subscription of \u00a3100 per investor under the Retail Offer. The terms and conditions on which investors subscribe will be provided by the relevant financial intermediaries including relevant commission or fee charges.\nThe Company reserves the right to amend the size and timings of the retail offer at its discretion. The Company reserves the right to scale back any order and to reject any application for subscription under the WRAP Retail Offer without giving any reason for such rejection.\nIt is vital to note that once an application for Retail Offer Shares has been made and accepted via an intermediary, it cannot be withdrawn.\nThe Retail Offer Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid, and have the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after their date of issue.\nInvestors should make their own investigations into the merits of an investment in the Company. Nothing in this announcement amounts to a recommendation to invest in the Company or amounts to investment, taxation or legal advice.\nIt should be noted that a subscription for Ordinary Shares and investment in the Company carries a number of risks, including the risk that investors may lose their entire investment. Investors should take independent advice from a person experienced in advising on investment in securities such as the Ordinary Shares if they are in any doubt.\nAn investment in the Company will place capital at risk. The value of investments, and any income, can go down as well as up, so investors could get back less than the amount invested.\nNeither past performance nor any forecasts should be considered a reliable indicator of future results.\nThe Retail Offer is offered in the United Kingdom under an exception from prohibitions on offers to the public pursuant to Schedule 1 (Part 1) of The Public Offers and Admission to Trading Regulations 2024 and under an exemption from the requirement to publish a prospectus under the\nFCA's Prospectus Rules: Admission to Trading on a Regulated Market sourcebook\n.
