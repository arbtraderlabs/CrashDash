Under the WRAP Retail Offer up to 50,000,000 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nWRAP Retail Offer Shares\n\") will be made available at a price of 1 pence per share.\nIn addition to the WRAP Retail Offer and as announced 21 January 2026, the Company is also proposing a placing and subscription of new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nPlacing Shares\n\" and \"\nSubscription Shares\n\" and together with the WRAP Retail Offer Shares, the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") to raise a minimum of \u00a33.5 million (before expenses) through a bookbuild process (the \"\nPlacing\n\") and subscription (the \"\nSubscription\n\") at a price of 1 pence per New Ordinary Share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\"). The Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 47.4 per cent. to the mid-market closing price of an Ordinary Share on 20 January 2026 (being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement). The issue price of the WRAP Retail Offer Shares is equal to the Issue Price.\nA separate announcement has been made regarding the Placing and its terms and sets out the reasons for the Placing and use of proceeds. The proceeds of the WRAP Retail Offer will be utilised in the same way as the proceeds of the Placing.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the WRAP Retail Offer is not part of the Placing. Completion of the WRAP Retail Offer is conditional, inter alia, upon the completion of the Placing but completion of the Placing is not conditional on the completion of the WRAP Retail Offer.\nThe issue of the Retail Offer Shares is conditional upon, inter alia, the approval of certain resolutions to be put to shareholders of GENinCode at a general meeting, which is expected to be held on 9 February 2026.\nThe WRAP Retail Offer and the Placing are conditional on the New Ordinary Shares being admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is anticipated that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares will commence on AIM at 8:00 a.m. on 11 February 2026.\nWRAP Retail Offer\nThe Company values its retail shareholder base and believes that it is appropriate to provide both new and existing retail shareholders in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in the WRAP Retail Offer.\nTherefore, the Company is making the WRAP Retail Offer open to eligible investors in the United Kingdom, being new or existing shareholders of GENinCode, following release of this announcement and through certain financial intermediaries.\nA number of retail platforms are able to access the WRAP Retail Offer. Non-holders or existing shareholders wishing to subscribe for Retail Offer Shares should contact their broker or wealth manager who will confirm if they are participating in the Retail Offer.\nRetail brokers wishing to participate in the Retail Offer on behalf of eligible retail investors, should contact WRAP@winterflood.com.\nThe Retail Offer\nis expected to close at 12.00 p.m. on 26 January 2026. Eligible retail investors should note that financial intermediaries may have earlier closing times.\nThe result of the Retail Offer is expected to be announced by the Company on or around\n26 January\n2026.\nTo be eligible to participate in the Retail Offer, applicants must be a customer of a participating intermediary including individuals aged 18 years or over, companies and other bodies corporate, partnerships, trusts, associations and other unincorporated organisations.\nThere is a minimum subscription of \u00a3100 per investor under the Retail Offer. The terms and conditions on which investors subscribe will be provided by the relevant financial intermediaries including relevant commission or fee charges.\nThe Company reserves the right to amend the size and timings of the retail offer at its discretion. The Company reserves the right to scale back any order and to reject any application for subscription under the WRAP Retail Offer without giving any reason for such rejection.\nIt is vital to note that once an application for Retail Offer Shares has been made and accepted via an intermediary, it cannot be withdrawn.\nThe Retail Offer Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid, and have the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after their date of issue.\nInvestors should make their own investigations into the merits of an investment in the Company. Nothing in this announcement amounts to a recommendation to invest in the Company or amounts to investment, taxation or legal advice.\nIt should be noted that a subscription for Ordinary Shares and investment in the Company carries a number of risks, including the risk that investors may lose their entire investment. Investors should take independent advice from a person experienced in advising on investment in securities such as the Ordinary Shares if they are in any doubt.\nAn investment in the Company will place capital at risk. The value of investments, and any income, can go down as well as up, so investors could get back less than the amount invested.\nNeither past performance nor any forecasts should be considered a reliable indicator of future results.\nThe Retail Offer is offered in the United Kingdom under an exception from prohibitions on offers to the public pursuant to Schedule 1 (Part 1) of The Public Offers and Admission to Trading Regulations 2024 and under an exemption from the requirement to publish a prospectus under the\nFCA's Prospectus Rules: Admission to Trading on a Regulated Market sourcebook\n.

The test has been designed and optimized for population-based risk prediction and primary prevention of heart disease and\nis being made\navailable at affordable pricing to international healthcare systems.\nBy integrating CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae into existing clinical pathways, healthcare providers can more accurately identify individuals at heightened 'lifetime risk' of heart disease and personalise treatment and prevention strategies. This preventive approach reduces the incidence of severe cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, and mitigates the economic costs associated with long-term heart disease care. It represents a significant step to improving public health outcomes and particularly in addressing the global burden of cardiovascular disease.\nMatthew Walls, GENinCode Chief Executive Officer said; \"\nWe are delighted to announce this latest distribution agreement with Sohin Genetics to sell CARDIO inCode-Score in Mexico.

In the UK, it is the most common form of death and disability, with approximately 2.3 million people living with the condition2.\nCHD occurs when the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become narrowed by build-up of fatty materials (cholesterol and other lipids) which give rise to what is commonly known as atherosclerosis or heart disease. Atherosclerosis restricts blood flow to the heart causing symptoms like angina (chest pain) with increasing atherosclerosis burden giving rise to heart attack (or ischemic stroke) if the artery becomes completely blocked by a blood clot.\n1.\nWorld Health Organisation -\nwww.who.int\n- The leading causes of death\n2.\nBritish Heart Foundation -\nwww.bhf.org.uk\n- Statistics\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

JACC: Advances, a medical journal which is part of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), specifically focuses on the latest research in cardiovascular medicine including new treatments, technologies and scientific discoveries in Cardiology leading to better clinical practices in the medical field.\nThe peer-reviewed study1., titled\n\"Joint Consideration of LDL-C and Polygenic Risk for Coronary Heart Disease Risk Assessment\"\n, was conducted by researchers at Kaiser Permanente's Department of Research and Department of Cardiology in San Francisco, California, USA.\nStudy Overview\nThe Kaiser Permanente study followed over 47,000 individuals of diverse ancestry for 14 years, analysing the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and polygenic risk for coronary heart disease. Participants were assessed for the incidence of CHD events including myocardial infarction (heart attack).\nThe CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae PRS was used to quantify each participant's inherited risk of CHD based on genetic variation across the genome. The study examined whether the effect of LDL-cholesterol on CHD risk was modified by an individual's underlying genetic risk.\nKey Findings\nThe results demonstrated that genetic risk significantly influences the relationship between LDL-cholesterol and coronary heart disease, with the combination of elevated LDL-C and high PRS conferring substantially greater risk.\n\u00b7\nIndividuals with high polygenic risk experienced a 75% increase in CHD risk at LDL-C levels as low as 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L)\n(Hazard Ratio: 1.75)\n.\n\u00b7\nAt LDL-C levels of 130-160 mg/dL (3.4 - 4.1 mmol/L), risk increased more than twofold (HR: 2.1).\n\u00b7\nThe combination of a high PRS and LDL-C of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher was associated with a greater than 3.5-fold increase in CHD risk, comparable to the risk observed in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a well-established genetic condition conferring very high cardiovascular risk.\nThese findings confirm that polygenic risk acts as a powerful modifier of LDL-cholesterol-related CHD risk, supporting its use in clinical decision-making and preventive care.\nClinical and Preventive Implications\nThis study underscores the critical role that integrating genetic data with clinical assessments can play in revolutionising cardiovascular risk stratification and prevention and guide earlier intervention in at-risk populations.\nIndividuals with high genetic risk may benefit from more proactive lipid management and lifestyle or therapeutic intervention, even at LDL-C levels traditionally considered low or moderate.\nBy integrating polygenic risk assessment into existing clinical pathways, healthcare providers can more accurately identify individuals at heightened lifetime risk of CHD and personalise prevention strategies. This can also reduce the incidence of severe cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, and potentially mitigate the economic costs associated with long-term heart disease care. This approach can be seen as a significant step toward improving public health outcomes, particularly in addressing the global burden of cardiovascular disease.\nDr. Richard Kovacs, Q.E. and Sally Russell Professor of Cardiology at the Indiana University School of Medicine and Chief Medical Officer of the American College of Cardiology and Past President of the American College of Cardiology said:\n\"\nThese results provide further compelling clinical evidence for the inclusion of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in conjunction with clinical risk for improved risk assessment of CHD. The polygenic risk score is especially important in relation to patients clinically classified at borderline/intermediate risk and younger patients with a family history of CHD. The recent scientific statements and acknowledgment of the value of PRS by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association is also welcome.\"\n1. -\nhttps://share.google/nQwFO73QgGTiRqK45\nNotes to Editors\n\u00b7\nHazard Ratio (HR)\nrefers to the measure of relative risk over time.

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the predictive genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (\"CVD\") and risk of ovarian cancer announces its collaboration with\nthe North Central London (NCL) Cancer Alliance and\nUniversity College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH)\n,\nwhich becomes the first hospital trust in the UK to provide the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) surveillance test service as part of its Familial Cancer Clinic. The service, in line with new NICE guidance1, is for women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer due to inherited\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ngene alterations, who wish to defer preventative surgery.\nWomen who carry a cancer-causing variant in the\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ngene have a 44% and 17% respectively in their lifetime risk of ovarian cancer (\"OC\") up to the age of 80 years. Around one in every 400 people carries a cancer-causing variant in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. They are advised to undergo surgical removal of their fallopian tubes and ovaries to prevent OC.\nThis remains the safest option for this group of patients. NICE guidance also recommends that surveillance should be offered to women who choose to defer surgery to be able to have children and/or avoid early menopause. UCLH is the first trust in the country to offer this surveillance on the NHS, outside of a trial setting.\nThe ROCA Test's proprietary algorithm calculates a woman's individual risk based on several clinical factors. These include cumulative Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125) blood test results, age, menopausal status and the presence of a\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ngene alteration. Having the ROCA blood test every four months improves the chances of early detection of ovarian cancer (pre-stages III and IV). Early detection improves treatment outcomes.\nThree key prospective studies have been conducted using the ROCA Test with women at high-risk of OC. The first UK study UKFOCSS was led by University College London (UCL). Based on the reduction in late-stage ovarian cancer seen in this trial, a 'real world' NHS implementation study, ALDO was initiated to assess the feasibility of ROCA surveillance in the NHS and to conduct an economic analysis. Based on these data, and a further US study, which together report a 44% reduction in late-stage ovarian cancer detections (stage III and IV), the NICE committee concluded that the ROCA Test is the preferred method of surveillance for women deferring preventative surgery. Economic analysis also indicates a cost saving to the NHS.\nProfessor Adam Rosenthal, Consultant Gynaecologist at UCLH said:\n\"Having pioneered the clinical trials in this area, we have reached a significant milestone in being able to offer ROCA surveillance for high-risk women in our NHS Familial Cancer Clinic. The service will give women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene alterations a surveillance option if they want to complete their families or defer preventive surgery for other reasons.\"\nAli Malik, Managing Director of the NCL Cancer Alliance said: \"\nAfter supporting the ALDO study to prove the viability of the using the ROCA Test, we are proud to help UCLH establish this service. For the first time it will empower all eligible women across North Central London who are not ready to undergo cancer prevention surgery. Surveillance means that their ovarian cancer risk will be closely monitored and hence mitigate the risk of being diagnosed at the most advanced stages. This step forward highlights the Cancer Alliance's distinctive role in initiating, evaluating, and embedding innovative approaches into clinical practice.\"\nMatthew Walls, Chief Executive Officer, GENinCode Plc said\n:\n\"We are delighted to have worked closely with UCLH and the North Central London Cancer Alliance to deliver this first NHS ROCA surveillance service for women at high-risk of ovarian cancer. It has required a significant effort from the cross-functional teams involved and we are grateful for their determination and focus. We look forward to extending the ROCA Test implementation to other NHS trusts in due course.\"\n1.\nNICE Guidance NG241 Ovarian cancer: identifying and managing familial and genetic risk\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng241\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nEnquiries:\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny/ Trisyia Jamaludin (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Sciences Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward (Corporate Broking)\nWalbrook PR Limited\nAnna Dunphy / Paul McManus / Marcus Ulker\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\ngenincode@walbrookpr.com\nAbout GENinCode:\nGENinCode Plc is a UK based company specialising in genetic risk assessment of cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.\nGENinCode operates business units in the UK, Europe through GENinCode S.L.U, and in the United States through GENinCode U.S. Inc.\nGENinCode predictive technology provides patients and physicians with globally leading preventive care and treatment strategies. GENinCode invitro-diagnostic molecular tests combine clinical algorithms and AI bioinformatics to advance patient risk assessment to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer.\nAbout Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):\nCVD is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated\u00a017.9 million lives each year. CVD is a group of\u00a0disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years\u00a0of age.\nCVD causes a quarter of all deaths in the UK and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas with the NHS\n10 Year Plan\nidentifying CVD as the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next 10 years. CVD is largely preventable, through lifestyle changes and a combination of public health and NHS action on smoking and tobacco addiction, obesity, tackling alcohol misuse and food reformulation.\nEarly detection and treatment of CVD can help patients live longer, healthier lives. Too many people are still living with undetected, high-risk conditions such as high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The NHS 10 Year Plan is working towards people knowing and managing risks around their 'ABC' (AF, Blood pressure and Cholesterol).\nAbout Ovarian Cancer (OC) and the ROCA test:\nOC occurs when abnormal cells in the ovaries or fallopian tubes grow and multiply out of control. Ovaries are part of the female reproductive system and are responsible for making eggs during a female's reproductive years.\nOC affects women and people assigned female at birth. It accounts for 1% of all new cancer cases and the lifetime risk of developing OC is approximately 1 in 78. OC is slightly more common in white populations than in people who are Black, Hispanic or Asian, while people who inherit a\nBRCA\ngene mutation are consider high risk of developing the disease. BRCA gene mutations occur in 0.3% of the population but is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish or Greenlander descent. Preventative surgery (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) is recommended for BRCA carriers.\nDiagnosis of OC typically occurs late stage due to the presentation of vague symptoms that are often confused with other more common conditions. As a result, treatment is intense and long-term survival is poor. Despite years of research, experts have struggled to develop an effective OC surveillance test that can detect the disease earlier.\nThe Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) Test is a globally leading OC surveillance test, proven to detect OC cancer before symptoms present and at an earlier stage. The test is intended for women over 35 with a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and who wish to defer preventative surgery. The ROCA test has recently received National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (NICE) guideline recommendation for OC surveillance.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

CVD is a group of\u00a0disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years\u00a0of age.\nCVD causes a quarter of all deaths in the UK and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas with the NHS\n10 Year Plan\nidentifying CVD as the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next 10 years. CVD is largely preventable, through lifestyle changes and a combination of public health and NHS action on smoking and tobacco addiction, obesity, tackling alcohol misuse and food reformulation.\nEarly detection and treatment of CVD can help patients live longer, healthier lives. Too many people are still living with undetected, high-risk conditions such as high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The NHS 10 Year Plan is working towards people knowing and managing risks around their 'ABC' (AF, Blood pressure and Cholesterol).\nAbout Ovarian Cancer (OC) and the ROCA test:\nOC occurs when abnormal cells in the ovaries or fallopian tubes grow and multiply out of control. Ovaries are part of the female reproductive system and are responsible for making eggs during a female's reproductive years.\nOC affects women and people assigned female at birth. It accounts for 1% of all new cancer cases and the lifetime risk of developing OC is approximately 1 in 78. OC is slightly more common in white populations than in people who are Black, Hispanic or Asian, while people who inherit a\nBRCA\ngene mutation are consider high risk of developing the disease. BRCA gene mutations occur in 0.3% of the population but is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish or Greenlander descent. Preventative surgery (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) is recommended for BRCA carriers.\nDiagnosis of OC typically occurs late stage due to the presentation of vague symptoms that are often confused with other more common conditions. As a result, treatment is intense and long-term survival is poor. Despite years of research, experts have struggled to develop an effective OC surveillance test that can detect the disease earlier.\nThe Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) Test is a globally leading OC surveillance test, proven to ",

In response to a request by the Company for a Supervisory Review, the FDA recently provided a review of its April 2025 assessment. While the number of the outstanding deficiencies has been reduced, the review upheld the FDA's prior view that there\nremains certain outstanding elements, including further information in relation to clinical validation.\nWith the feedback from the Supervisory Review, the Board remains of the view that there is a path forward to provide the further information to resolve these deficiencies to obtain De Novo classification. Discussions with the FDA have been productive with the outstanding deficiencies reducing. The Board does not believe that there are any elements that it cannot address, however there can be no certainty that the information provided will be sufficient.\nThe Company has arranged further ongoing clarifictory discussions with the FDA and will provide a further update if this provides additional information.\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nEnquiries:\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nGiles\nBalleny (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Sciences Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward (Corporate Broking)\nDale Bellis / Michael Johnson (Sales)\nTel: 020 7397 8900\nWalbrook PR Limited\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nAnna Dunphy / Louis Ashe-Jepson / Phillip Marriage\ngenincode@walbrookpr.com\nAbout GENinCode:\nGENinCode Plc is a UK based company specialising in genetic risk assessment of cardiovascular disease.

More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years\u00a0of age.\nCoronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease. In 2021 in the US, coronary heart disease accounted for\n375,476 deaths.\nAbout 1 in 20 adults age 20 and older have CHD (about 5%). In 2021, about 2 in 10 deaths from CHD happened in adults less than 65 years old. Globally it is estimated around 200 million people are living with coronary heart disease. A\nround 110 million men and 80 million women have coronary heart disease\n. Coronary heart disease kills an estimated nine million people each year - in 2019 it was the world's single biggest killer.\nIn the UK, cardiovascular disease causes a quarter of all deaths and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas and the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next 10 years. CVD is largely preventable, through lifestyle changes and a combination of public health and NHS action on smoking and tobacco addiction, obesity, tackling alcohol misuse and food reformulation.\nAside from the genetic risk of cardiovascular disease, the most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, excess weight and obesity. These \"clinical risks factors\" can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.\nIdentifying those at highest risk of coronary heart disease and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. Access to medicines and basic health technology in all primary health care facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling.\nEarly detection and treatment of CVD can help patients live long",

BRCA gene mutations occur in 0.3% of the population but is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish or Greenlander descent. Preventative surgery (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) is recommended for BRCA carriers.\nDiagnosis of OC typically occurs late stage due to the presentation of vague symptoms that are often confused with other more common conditions. As a result, treatment is intense and long-term survival is poor. Despite years of research, experts have struggled to develop an effective OC surveillance test that can detect the disease earlier.\nThe Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) Test is a globally leading OC surveillance test, proven to detect OC cancer before symptoms present and at an earlier stag",

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.\nGENinCode operates business units in the UK, Europe through GENinCode S.L.U, and in the United States through GENinCode U.S. Inc.\nGENinCode predictive technology provides patients and physicians with globally leading preventative care and treatment strategies. GENinCode CE marked invitro-diagnostic molecular tests combine clinical algorithms and bioinformatics to provide advanced patient risk assessment to predict cardiovascular disease.\nAbout Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):\nHeart and circulatory disease known collectively as Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated\u00a017.9 million lives each year. CVD is a group of\u00a0disorders of the heart and blood vessels that include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years\u00a0of age.\nCoronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease. In 2021 in the US, coronary heart disease accounted for\n375,476 deaths.\nAbout 1 in 20 adults age 20 and older have CHD (about 5%). In 2021, about 2 in 10 deaths from CHD happened in adults less than 65 years old. Globally it is estimated around 200 million people are living with coronary heart disease. A\nround 110 million men and 80 million women have coronary heart disease\n. Coronary heart disease kills an estimated nine million people each year - in 2019 it was the world's single biggest killer.\nIn the UK, cardiovascular disease causes a quarter of all deaths and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas and the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next 10 years. CVD is largely preventable, through lifestyle changes and a combination of public health and NHS action on smoking and tobacco addiction, obesity, tackling alcohol misuse and food reformulation.\nAside from the genetic risk of cardiovascular disease, the most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, excess weight and obesity. These \"clinical risks factors\" can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.\nIdentifying those at highest risk of coronary heart disease and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. Access to medicines and basic health technology in all primary health care facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling.\nEarly detection and treatment of CVD can help patients live longer, healthier lives\nis set out in the NHS 10 Year Plan.\nToo many people are still living with undetected, high-risk conditions such as raised cholesterol, high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation (AF). Globally, healthcare systems are making progress on identification and diagnosis of high genetic risk individ",

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, announces the inclusion of CARDIO inCode (for the polygenic risk assessment of coronary heart disease) in the US 2025 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) to enable reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid across the US. The company also announces the implementation of CARDIO inCode for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Spanish region of Catalonia.\nThe CARDIO inCode-Score test is being clinically adopted across leading US healthcare institutions and has now been included in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) from 2025. The CARDIO inCode test (CPT code: 0401U) price varies on a state by state basis ranging from $450 - $570 with a median price of ~$500/test. The company is also progressing its FDA '\nde novo'\nsubmission for CARDIO inCode and expects to provide an update on progress over the coming months.\nFollowing earlier CARDIO inCode test pilots across Spain, the Catalonia ministry of health has agreed to implement CARDIO inCode to improve the risk assessment of cardiovascular disease in primary care through the Catalan Health Institute - ICS (\"Institut Catal\u00e0 de la Salut\"). Catalonia is one of 17 Spanish regions providing state based health services to prevent CHD. Out of a total Spanish population of approximately 48 million, the Catalonia region has a population of 7.7m. CARDIO inCode will be provided to patients aged between 45 to 64 years targeting those at risk of CHD estimated at up up to 476,000 patients in the Catalonia region. Test volumes are expected to escalate up to approximately 1,000 patient tests through this year with volumes expanding as increasing numbers of physicians, community practices and regions are educated and onboarded for testing. The Company is also progressing pilot preparations for CARDIO inCode in other Spanish regions.\nGENinCode specialises in polygenic risk assessment for the prevention of CHD. CHD is the most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death worldwide and in the United Kingdon and United States.\nIn the UK around 7.6m people live with heart and circulatory disease, which causes 25% of all deaths annually. CHD can be reduced by identifying and treating individuals at risk, and the NHS 10 Year Plan (2019) focused on addressing CVD prevention.\nMatthew Walls, CEO of GENinCode PLC said:\n\"\nThe start of US revenues and inclusion in the CMS Clinical Lab Fee Schedule supports the US scale-up of CARDIO inCode for prevention of coronary heart disease. We anticipate an acceleration in adoption of CARDIO inCode across US states and health institutions post FDA approval. The success of the CARDIO inCode CHD prevention program in the Catalonia region of Spain marks a significant milestone allowing us to cross apply this state based primary care program to other Spanish regions.\"\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nEnquiries:\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny / Dan Hodkinson (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Sciences Specialist Sales)\nOndraya Swanson (Corporate Broking)\nDale Bellis / Michael Johnson (Sales)\nWalbrook PR Limited\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nAnna Dunphy / Louis Ashe-Jepson / Phillip Marriage\ngenincode@walbrookpr.com\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of GENinCode Plc is Matthew Walls, Chief Executive Officer.\nAbout GENinCode:\nGENinCode Plc is a UK based company specialising in genetic risk assessment of cardiovascular disease.

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the predictive genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (\"CVD\") and risk of ovarian cancer (\"OC\"), announces its partnership with Genesupport SA, part of the Sonic Switzerland network of laboratories, to enable country-wide access to the ROCA\u00ae Test.\nIn March 2024, the ROCA Test received a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (\"NICE\") recommendation as the preferred test for OC surveillance in individuals at high risk of ovarian cancer who wish to defer risk-reducing surgery.1\nBased on this milestone, Genesupport SA will make the ROCA Test available through all Sonic Switzerland diagnostic and genetic companies, including Genesupport, Medigenome Medisupport, Medica, Medisyn, and Dr Risch. These companies cover all major Swiss cities (Geneva, Lausanne, Bern and Zurich), and regional centers (e.g. St. Gallen, Zug, Lucerne, Lugano/Locarno). Genesupport is also affiliated with the major tumour centres and hospital groups across the country (e.g. Hirslanden and Swiss Medical Network). Genesupport will offer the test under the ROCA brand in Switzerland, to women who are BRCA positive and have not undertaken risk reducing surgery, with the test supporting an eligible population of more than 11,000 women at high risk of OC.\nEach year there are over 300,000 new cases of OC\nglobally and over half of those will die from the disease. The risk of developing OC is particularly high in individuals who inherit a known pathogenic variant in certain genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2.2\nSuch mutations occur in up to 0.4% of the general population and up to 3% of individuals of Jewish descent. I\ndentifying such individuals through genetic testing will allow healthcare professionals to better mitigate that risk through preventive surgery and/or surveillance.\nThe ROCA Test uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate a woman's individual OC risk based on several clinical factors including age and accumulating Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) blood test results. The ROCA Test has many years of clinical evaluation through prospective studies3 which have proven its high accuracy and ability to detect OC earlier. Earlier detection improves treatment outcomes.\nMatthew Walls, Chief Executive Officer of GENinCode Plc, said:\n\"\nWe are delighted to partner with Genesupport to allow access to the ROCA Test in the Swiss market. After many years of academic and corporate investment, the ROCA test is now lifting the standard of care for patients at high risk of familial ovarian cancer who decide to defer preventive surgery. Surveillance using the ROCA test will help individuals feel more supported while they start or build their families or until they are ready to undertake surgery\n.\"\nBernard Conrad, Chief Medical Officer of Genesupport, said:\n\"\nOffering the ROCA Test throughout the Sonic Switzerland network synergises well with our other services in the field of genetic testing and women's health. Based on the evidence that has accrued over many years, the ROCA Test is recognised as the best in class and is an important test to be able to offer women who face difficult choices in managing their familial ovarian cancer risk.\"\n1\nProject information | Ovarian cancer; identifying and managing familial and genetic risk |Guidance|NICE\n2\nBRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1 and PALB2\n3\u00a0Rosenthal, AN, et al.

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, announces the publication in the International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention of a clinical research study on the '\nInterplay between Lifestyle Factors and Polygenic Risk for Incident Coronary Heart Disease in a Large Multiethnic Cohort' 1\n.\nThe publication investigated a subset of over 60,000 adult individuals with no history of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) from the Genetic Epidemiology Resource in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) multi-ethnic cohort at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, USA. The study followed the individuals over an average follow-up of 14 years, using CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\n(CIC-SCORE) to assess the interplay of polygenic risk with lifestyle on the incidence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).\nFollowing the March 2024 publication in the American Society of Preventive Cardiology journal, this latest study shows that genetic and lifestyle (smoking, diet, exercise) factors are independently associated with incident CHD and\nlifestyle and genetic predisposition both influence the risk of incidence of coronary heart disease. The results also showed that individuals with high polygenic risk are likely to derive the most benefit from lifestyle change and/or therapeutic intervention, supporting the inclusion of polygenic risk assessment in lifestyle interventions.\nFor individuals with a high polygenic risk, a favourable lifestyle is associated with a 52% lower rate of CHD compared with an unfavourable lifestyle. This means that identifying individuals with an unfavourable lifestyle and high polygenic risk score and changing their behaviour to adopt a favourable lifestyle following a Mediterranean diet, regular physical exercise and non-smoking would halve their risk of a CHD event including non-fatal AMI, angina and coronary revascularisation procedures (coronary by-pass or percutaneous intervention\n) or CHD death.\nThis research will be presented at the ESC CardioGenomics 2024 conference on 6 December 2024 in Antwerp, Belgium.\nProfessor Ahmet Fuat, Honorary Professor of Primary Care Cardiology and NHS GP\nsaid:\n\"With the heritability of Coronary Heart Disease estimated at between 40-60%, I am delighted to see this milestone publication showing the importance of polygenic risk as an independent risk factor to identify and stratify individuals and prevent Coronary Heart Disease.\"\nJules Payne, CEO, HEART UK said:\n\"This publication raises the importance of\u00a0both\u00a0genetic and\u00a0secondary factors\u00a0to\u00a0predict risk\u00a0of Coronary\u00a0Heart Disease.\u00a0Genetic factors are not modifiable, therefore it is very important to identify\u00a0modifiable risk factors like lifestyle,\u00a0smoking, obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure in\u00a0individuals at risk of coronary and other arterial diseases\u00a0and address these factors as soon as possible.\u00a0Prevention of heart disease is core to the HEART UK charity and this advance will help us better educate, support and influence families and health professionals on cardiovascular disease prevention.\"\nGENinCode specialises in polygenic risk assessment to prevent Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). CHD is the most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death worldwide and in the United Kingdon and United States.\nCARDIO inCode-Score is being clinically adopted in leading US healthcare institutions and has received the grant of its CPT PLA code from the American Medical Association for health insurance coverage and reimbursement. CARDIO inCode-Score will also be included in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Clinical Lab Fee Schedule from 2025.\nCARDIO inCode-Score is a in-vitro diagnostic test used to assess an individual's genetic (DNA) risk of Coronary Heart Disease. The test is\nbased on published clinical evidence amassed over 16 years which in conjunction\nwith traditional clinical risk factors provides a comprehensive risk assessment (clinical + genetic) of Coronary Heart Disease for use in primary preventive care. GENinCode labs process patient DNA samples and deliver the CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae test results to physicians via its online international reporting system ('SITAB').\nCARDIO inCode-Score also addresses the well-recognised need for improvement in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) standard of care across ethnicities and in borderline or intermediate CVD risk patients. A significant proportion of CHD events take place in individuals classified as being at borderline or intermediate CVD risk, and thus not candidates for aggressive clinica",

This approach can identify both adults and children early in life, allowing earlier treatment with cholesterol-lowering therapies and reductions in the risk of heart disease.\nIndividuals tested in the program will be identified from two\nUS healthcare systems, UT Southwestern Medical Center and the Veteran Affairs (VA) North Texas Health Care system. After an individual is genetically confirmed to have FH, the Family Heart Foundation will directly contact at-risk family members to educate them about their risk for FH, the significance, and coordinate genetic testing.\n\"Collaborating with GENinCode and partners to implement FH testing brings us one step closer to broader and more accessible cascade screening at a national level, helping to save future generations from cardiovascular disease,\"\nsaid Katherine Wilemon, Founder and CEO of Family Heart Foundation\n. \"Cascade screening is a powerful, proven method to improve early diagnosis of FH and reduce preventable heart attacks and strokes. Together, we are poised to make this life-saving screening more accessible, ultimately safeguarding the health of future generations and reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease.\"\nProfessor Zahid Ahmed, Program Lead for DISCOVER FH commented:\n\"We are delighted to work with GENinCode and implement LIPID inCode\u00ae for the diagnosis and treatment familial hypercholesterolemia. The added benefit of easy sample collection, improved test turnaround times at a reduced cost will help us deliver the Lipid inCode test in our practice, and we welcome this approach to help us deliver this first phase of the plan to reduce the onset of cardiovascular disease.\"\nFH is an inherited condition\n, affecting about 1 in every 250 individuals globally. If a person has FH, there is a 50% chance that their children, siblings, and parents also carry the familial variant. People with FH have extremely high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C, aka \"bad cholesterol\") from birth which dramatically increases their risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at a young age. ASCVD is cardiovascular disease as a result of cholesterol deposits in the arteries and includes heart attack, angina, the need for stents and bypass surgery, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and even sudden cardiac death. Fortunately, treatment with cholesterol-lowering drugs can significantly reduce this risk.\nUnfortunately, less than 30% of people with FH in the US have been identified, despite the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prioritize FH for early detection, cascade screening, and proactive treatment with cholesterol-lowering drugs. Furthermore,\npeople with FH and their families have recognized the missed opportunities when families are not screened for FH.\nThe standard of care for cascade screening in the US relies on healthcare providers educating FH patients on the importance of family screening with no ability to ensure this screening happens. The Family Heart Foundation is uniquely positioned to serve as a centralized coordinating office to assist and support families in need regardless of geographic location.\nEstablishing an effective cascade screening strategy in the US is urgent. Without it, up to 1 million individuals with FH may remain undiagnosed and untreated, putting them at heightened risk for heart attacks, surgical interventions, and premature death. These outcomes not only devastate families, but also impose significant costs on the healthcare system and society, particularly as heart disease linked to FH often affects younger individuals.\nIn the UK around 7.6m people liv",

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.\nGENinCode operates business units in the UK, Europe through GENinCode S.L.U, and in the United States through GENinCode U.S. Inc.\nGENinCode predictive technology provides patients and physicians with globally leading preventive care and treatment strategies. GENinCode invitro-diagnostic molecular tests combine clinical algorithms and AI bioinformatics to advance patient risk assessment to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer.\nAbout Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):\nCVD is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated\u00a017.9 million lives each year. CVD is a group of\u00a0disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years\u00a0of age.\nCVD causes a quarter of all deaths in the UK and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas with the NHS\n10 Year Plan\nidentifying CVD as the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next 10 years. CVD is largely preventable, through lifestyle changes and a combination of public health and NHS action on smoking and tobacco addiction, obesity, tackling alcohol misuse and food reformulation.\nEarly detection and treatment of CVD can help patients live longer, healthier lives. Too many people are still living with undetected, high-risk conditions such as high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The NHS 10 Year Plan is working towards people knowing and managing risks around their 'ABC' (AF, Blood pressure and Cholesterol).\nAbout Ovarian Cancer (OC) and the ROCA test:\nOC occurs when abnormal cells in the ovaries or fallopian tubes grow and multiply out of control. Ovaries are part of the female reproductive system and are responsible for making eggs during a female's reproductive years.\nOC affects women and people assigned female at birth. It accounts for 1% of all new cancer cases and the lifetime risk of developing OC is approximately 1 in 78. OC is slightly more common in white populations than in people who are Black, Hispanic or Asian, while people who inherit a\nBRCA\ngene mutation are consider high risk of developing the disease. BRCA gene mutations occur in 0.3% of the population but is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish or Greenlander descent. Preventative surgery (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) is recommended for BRCA carriers.\nDiagnosis of OC typically occurs late stage due to the presentation of vague symptoms that are often confused with other more common conditions. As a result, treatment is intense and long-term survival is poor. Despite years of research, experts have struggled to develop an effective OC surveillance test that can detect the disease earlier.\nThe Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) Test is a glo",

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the polygenics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer, announces the presentation by Kaiser Permanente on the interplay between family history and polygenic risk on the incidence of coronary heart disease (\"CHD\") which will take place at the 2024 Annual Congress of the European Society of Cardiology (\"ESC\") in London from 30 August to 2 September 2024.\nFollowing the March 2024 milestone publication in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology1, this latest study shows CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\nPRS and family history in first degree relatives independently contribute to the risk of incident CHD, with a 42% increase in risk in the presence of a positive family history and a 64% increase where the patient has a high polygenic risk score (\"PRS\"). Importantly, the study showed the joint effect of positive family history and a high polygenic risk increased the hazard or incidence of CHD by 2.3 times. Thus, relying solely on self reported (patient) family history is insufficient to fully characterise the genetic contribution to CHD and PRS is recommended.\nThe Kaiser Permanente Division of Research study investigated more than 63,000 adult individuals with no history of CHD who are part of the Kaiser\nPermanente Northern\nCalifornia Genetic Epidemiology Resource in Adult Health and Aging (\"GERA\") multi-ethnic cohort. The GERA cohort followed the membership over an average of 14 years, using CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\nto assess the polygenic risk of CHD and future incidence of risk of CHD.\nIndividuals with a high polygenic risk of CHD should be prioritised for lifestyle advice\nand where appropriate therapeutic intervention\nas those at the highest polygenic risk will benefit most from earlier and/or more intensified treatment, especially where they have family history. Previous data on CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\npresented at last year's ESC showed that where individuals have a high polygenic risk, a favourable lifestyle is associated with a 52% lower rate of CHD compared with an unfavourable lifestyle\n. T\nhe latest study continues to underline the need for 'polygenic risk score' lifetime risk assessment in conjunction with traditional clinical risk assessment (including family history) to optimise preventive care strategies and lower the future risk of CHD.\nPolygenic risk assessment can be undertaken in younger people, before conventional clinical risk factors (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.) have developed, and can be combined with conventional risk scoring in older people. In this way clinicians can more accurately identify those most likely to benefit from lifestyle and therapeutic intervention (precision medicine).\nIn the UK around 7.6 million people live with heart and circulatory disease, which causes 25% of all UK deaths annually. Cardiovascular Disease (\"CVD\") can be reduced by identifying and treating individuals at risk, with the NHS 10 Year Plan (2019) setting out to address CVD prevention.\nMatthew Walls, CEO of GENinCode said:\n\"This latest ESC presentation on CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae continues to strengthen the clinical utility and importance of polygenic risk assessment to identify individuals in the population at high genetic risk enabling targeted treatment to prevent coronary heart disease.\"\n1.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666667724000291\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nEnquiries:\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny /Dan Hodkinson (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks/ Harriet Ward (Corporate Broking)\nDale Bellis / Michael Johnson (Sales)\nWalbrook PR Limited\nAnna Dunphy / Louis Ashe-Jepson / Phillip Marriage\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or genincode@walbrookpr.com\nAbout GENinCode:\nGENinCode Plc is a UK based company specialising in genetic risk assessment of cardiovascular disease.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.\nGENinCode operates business units in the UK, Europe through GENinCode S.L.U, and in the United States through GENinCode U.S. Inc.\nGENinCode predictive technology provides patients and physicians with globally leading preventive care and treatment strategies. GENinCode invitro-diagnostic molecular tests combine clinical algorithms and AI bioinformatics to advance patient risk assessment to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer.\nAbout Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):\nCVD is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated\u00a017.9 million lives each year. CVD is a group of\u00a0disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years\u00a0of age.\nCVD causes a quarter of all deaths in the UK and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas with the NHS\n10 Year Plan\nidentifying CVD as the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next 10 years. CVD is largely preventable, through lifestyle changes and a combination of public health and NHS action on smoking and tobacco addiction, obesity, tackling alcohol misuse and food reformulation.\nEarly detection and treatment of CVD can help patients live longer, healthier lives. Too many people are still living with undetected, high-risk conditions such as high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The NHS 10 Year Plan is working towards people knowing and managing risks around their 'ABC' (AF, Blood pressure and Cholesterol).\nAbout Ovarian Cancer (OC) and the ROCA test:\nOC occurs when abnormal cells in the ovaries or fallopian tubes grow and multiply out of control. Ovaries are part of the female reproductive system and are responsible for making eggs during a female's reproductive years.\nOC affects women and people assigned female at birth. It accounts for 1% of all new cancer cases and the lifetime risk of developing OC is approximately 1 in 78. OC is slightly more common in white populations than in people who are Black, Hispanic or Asian, while people who inherit a\nBRCA\ngene mutation are consider high risk of developing the disease. BRCA gene mutations occur in 0.3% of the population but is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish or Greenlander descent. Preventative surgery (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) is recommended for BRCA carriers.\nDiagnosis of OC typically occurs late stage due to the presentation of vague symptoms that are often confused with other more common conditions. As a result, treatment is intense and long-term survival is poor. Despite years of research, experts have struggled to develop an effective OC surveillance test that can detect the disease earlier.\nThe Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) Test is a globally leading OC surveillance test, proven to detect OC cancer before symptoms present and ",

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the polygenics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer, announces a presentation by Kaiser Permanente at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Preventive Cardiology congress in Athens, Greece, on the\n'Joint consideration of\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\"LDL-C\") and polygenic risk for incident coronary heart disease in a multi-ethnic cohort of 48,881 individuals'\nusing CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\n.1\nThe Kaiser Permanente Division of Research study investigated individuals who were part of the Northern California Genetic Epidemiology Resource in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) multi-ethnic population-based cohort. The GERA cohort followed the membership over an average of 14 years, using CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\nto assess the polygenic risk of coronary heart disease (\"CHD\") and the incidence of CHD events in association with LDL-C.\nA CHD event was defined as non-fatal\nheart attack\n,\ncoronary\nrevascularisation procedures or CHD death.\nThe study found that LDL-C and polygenic risk are independently associated with incident CHD, and that CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\nidentifies individuals\nat\nthe highest\nrisk of\nCHD across LDL-C levels.\nWhilst all patients with elevated LDL-C ought to be treated, the data indicated that lipid lowering therapies may be more effective among those with high polygenic risk, as the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one CHD event was much lower in the high polygenic risk group. The data also indicated that subjects with a high\nCARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\nshould not have LDL-C levels above 130 mg/dL, as their CHD risk is similar to those with LDL-C =>190 mg/dL and a low polygenic risk.\nThe presentation follows the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology publication earlier this month indicating\nindividuals with a high polygenic risk score should be prioritised for lifestyle advice\nand where appropriate therapeutic intervention\nas they will benefit the most. Previous data with CARDIO inCode-Score\n\u00ae\nhas shown that, for individuals with a high genetic risk, a favourable lifestyle is associated with a 52% lower rate of CHD compared with an unfavourable lifestyle\n.\nT\nhe study underlines the need for 'polygenic risk score' lifetime risk assessment in conjunction with traditional clinical risk assessment to optimise preventive care strategies to lower the future risk of CHD.\nPolygenic risk assessment can be undertaken in younger people, before conventional clinical risk factors (such as high LDL-C levels, high blood pressure, diabetes etc.) have developed and can be combined with conventional risk scoring in older people. By doing this clinicians can better identify those most likely to benefit from lifestyle and therapeutic intervention.\nIn the UK around 7.6 million people live with heart and circulatory disease, which causes 25% of all deaths annually. Cardiovacular disease (CVD) can be reduced by identifying and treating individuals at risk, and the NHS 10 Year Plan (2019) sets out to address CVD prevention.\n1.\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/6995M_1-2024-4-30.pdf\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nEnquiries:\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny /Dale Bellis / Michael Johnson\nDale Bellis / Michael Johnson (Sales)\nWalbrook PR Limited\nAnna Dunphy / Louis Ashe-Jepson / Phillip Marriage\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\ngenincode@walbrookpr.com\nAbout GENinCode:\nGENinCode Plc is a UK based company specialising in genetic risk assessment of cardiovascular disease.

GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the predictive genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (\"CVD\") and risk of ovarian cancer (\"OC\"), announces that its Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (\"ROCA\") test, has received a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (\"NICE\") recommendation as the preferred test for OC surveillance in individuals at high risk of ovarian cancer who do not undertake risk reducing surgery. The new NICE guidance\n[1]\nis focused on identifying and managing familial and genetic risk of OC.\nEach year i\nn the UK, 7,500 women are diagnosed with OC and over half of those will die from the disease. The risk of developing OC is particularly high in individuals who inherit a known pathogenic variant in certain genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is estimated that up to 170,000 people in the UK may be carriers of a BRCA gene variant. I\ndentifying such individuals through genetic testing will allow the NHS to better mitigate that risk through prevention and/or surveillance.\nPreventative surgery to remove both ovaries and fallopian tubes is the standard of care but where this is not possible, or where the patient decides to delay surgery, NICE now recommends that individuals can be offered surveillance using the ROCA test. The NICE committee reviewed various surveillance protocols, as published in the peer reviewed literature, and concluded that the ROCA test was the most accurate with the best detection rate for earlier stages of OC (stage IIIa or lower). Detection of OC at an earlier stage is associated with a better prognosis and treatment.\nThe ROCA test uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate a woman's individual OC risk based on several clinical factors including age and accumulating Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) blood test results. The ability of the ROCA test to interpret changes in an individual's CA-125 level over time through four monthly interval testing was recognised by the NICE committee as an important contributor to its accuracy and ability to detect OC earlier. Additionally, the NICE committee recognised the published evidence that s\nurveillance using the ROCA test would have a cost-saving benefit for the NHS.\nMatthew Walls, Chief Executive Officer of GENinCode Plc, said:\n\"\nToday's publication of NICE guidance is an important milestone for the ROCA test. After many years of academic and corporate investment, the ROCA test has been comprehensively assessed by NICE as the surveillance technology of choice where patients at high risk of familial OC decide to defer preventative surgery. Surveillance using the ROCA test will help individuals feel more supported while they start or grow their families or until they reach\nmenopause, whilst also providing a cost-saving benefit for the NHS.\nThe GENinCode team will now assist the NHS to help establish appropriate call and recall systems that will enable the ROCA test to be offered by the NHS to all eligible individuals\n.\"\n1.\nProject information | Ovarian cancer; identifying and managing familial and genetic risk |Guidance|NICE\nFor more information visit\nwww.genincode.com\nGENinCode Plc\nwww.genincode.com\nor via Walbrook PR\nMatthew Walls, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nGiles Balleny /Dale Bellis / Michael Johnson\nWalbrook PR Limited\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nAnna Dunphy / Louis Ashe-Jepson / Phillip Marriage\ngenincode@walbrookpr.com\nAbout GENinCode\nGENinCode Plc is a UK based company specialising in genetic risk assessment of cardiovascular disease and risk of ovarian cancer, two of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.\nGENinCode operates business units in the UK, in the United States through GENinCode U.S. Inc and in Europe through GENinCode S.L.U.\nGENinCode predictive technology provides patients and physicians with globally leading preventative care and treatment strategies.

          "content": "Hi everyone there were a couple of doubts indicated during the last investor meet presentation that did concern me. One was that all of the sales capital from LipidinCode sales had not been banked yet as the insurance companies that payout for individuals can contest the payment through some sort of appeals system. The payments will probably land at some point but the revenues on the balance sheet indicated that a fair value was still to materialise. I was not aware that this delay was common place in the industry and  also could that same delay occur once CIC score is being sold? The other unknown / doubt is what capital will be required to energise the launch of CIC on approval. Previous raises have partially been for such a launch and the required capital was quite substantial, although Geni management have done a fantastic job of on-boarding prior to approval that this may compensate for new capital required, but who knows how much? My last nagging question is about timing of FDA approval because I might be wrong but after listening to the presentations again it came across that the required information requested should be available in Q1 2026 for submission to FDA  and does not recessarily mean that approval will be granted in Q1. I stand to be corrected but it is only how I interpreted the information. Let's hope that it all the information they are looking for and approve in quick succession. This is probably why some buyers are holding back right now as we all know Geni sp can move both ways rapidly but I am holding out for the golden nugget RNS sometime in Q1 hopefully. We know the potential here is huge but having been a holder of some since IPO I couldn't time it if I tried lol. Best of luck to all holders into 2026. Cheers Swissy",

          "content": "Cavendish note released today, target price 11.5p GENinCode* Collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific GENinCode has announced a collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific, to sell, distribute and manufacture the company\u2019s CARDIO inCode-Score polygenic test for the prediction and prevention of coronary heart disease. We expect this partnership to support and accelerate the adoption and commercialisation of CARDIO inCode, particularly in the US and EMEA, where Thermo Fisher has a significant platform presence for testing. We believe the collaboration provides strong validation of GENinCode\u2019s technology and the CARDIO inCodeScore test, which has seen a number of clinical studies published, highlighting the test\u2019s ability to identify patients at greater risk of coronary heart disease based on their genetic risk. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of genetic data alongside traditional risk assessments to better predict and prevent heart disease, the leading cause of death globally. Investment thesis: We believe GENinCode is making strong progress within its three target regions. The Thermo Fisher collaboration validates the opportunity for CARDIO inCode in the US, while the company develops its UK and EU strategies, including the launch of the ROCA test in the UK. With a large and global patient population to target, clinical statements recognising the importance of polygenic risk scores for heart disease and a broadly unaddressed genetic testing market for cardiovascular disease, we believe GENinCode remains well-placed in the emerging market of cardiovascular genetic risk assessment.",

          "content": "Hi everyone there were a couple of doubts indicated during the last investor meet presentation that did concern me. One was that all of the sales capital from LipidinCode sales had not been banked yet as the insurance companies that payout for individuals can contest the payment through some sort of appeals system. The payments will probably land at some point but the revenues on the balance sheet indicated that a fair value was still to materialise. I was not aware that this delay was common place in the industry and  also could that same delay occur once CIC score is being sold? The other unknown / doubt is what capital will be required to energise the launch of CIC on approval. Previous raises have partially been for such a launch and the required capital was quite substantial, although Geni management have done a fantastic job of on-boarding prior to approval that this may compensate for new capital required, but who knows how much? My last nagging question is about timing of FDA approval because I might be wrong but after listening to the presentations again it came across that the required information requested should be available in Q1 2026 for submission to FDA  and does not recessarily mean that approval will be granted in Q1. I stand to be corrected but it is only how I interpreted the information. Let's hope that it all the information they are looking for and approve in quick succession. This is probably why some buyers are holding back right now as we all know Geni sp can move both ways rapidly but I am holding out for the golden nugget RNS sometime in Q1 hopefully. We know the potential here is huge but having been a holder of some since IPO I couldn't time it if I tried lol. Best of luck to all holders into 2026. Cheers Swissy",

The price pressure here on the charts does show  a continuing sell as it dropped rapidly last time between a bid of 1.35p from a support of 2p. It has just broken that support  although early doors so has a possibility of further rapid downtrend if news doesn't land early in Q1. I love the oroducts and the management team but will hold a little back just in case. Let's hope tge big H comrs in soon hey! Cheers Swissy.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

I cannot see the SP above the issue price until the days after the shares have been placed in the market - it happens all the time. Admission, Settlement and Dealings Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM, being the market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is expected that admission of the New Ordinary Shares will take place on or around 8.00 a.m. 11 February 2026 and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares on AIM will commence at the same time. In addition to the passing of certain Resolutions at the General Meeting, the Placing and Subscription, are conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective. The Placing is not subject to clawback from the Retail Offer. Following Admission of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares and assuming the full take up of the Retail Offer, the Company will have 725,027,042 Ordinary Shares in issue. The New Ordinary Shares to be issued, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.",

Whoever this person is they have put substantial funds here. I have read that he is a founder of a top pharma in Spain but cant be sure if that its the same guy.

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

          "content": "Background to GENinCode plc GENinCode is a genetics company focussed on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (\"CVD\") and the early detection of ovarian cancer. Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

I cannot see the SP above the issue price until the days after the shares have been placed in the market - it happens all the time. Admission, Settlement and Dealings Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM, being the market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is expected that admission of the New Ordinary Shares will take place on or around 8.00 a.m. 11 February 2026 and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares on AIM will commence at the same time. In addition to the passing of certain Resolutions at the General Meeting, the Placing and Subscription, are conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective. The Placing is not subject to clawback from the Retail Offer. Following Admission of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares and assuming the full take up of the Retail Offer, the Company will have 725,027,042 Ordinary Shares in issue. The New Ordinary Shares to be issued, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

          "content": "It may be sooner than Autumn - Near-Term Catalysts: With funding nearly in place and Thermo Fisher as a partner, GENinCode is poised for substantial news in the coming months. Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Whoever this person is they have put substantial funds here. I have read that he is a founder of a top pharma in Spain but cant be sure if that its the same guy.

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

          "content": "It may be sooner than Autumn - Near-Term Catalysts: With funding nearly in place and Thermo Fisher as a partner, GENinCode is poised for substantial news in the coming months. Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

I cannot see the SP above the issue price until the days after the shares have been placed in the market - it happens all the time. Admission, Settlement and Dealings Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM, being the market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is expected that admission of the New Ordinary Shares will take place on or around 8.00 a.m. 11 February 2026 and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares on AIM will commence at the same time. In addition to the passing of certain Resolutions at the General Meeting, the Placing and Subscription, are conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective. The Placing is not subject to clawback from the Retail Offer. Following Admission of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares and assuming the full take up of the Retail Offer, the Company will have 725,027,042 Ordinary Shares in issue. The New Ordinary Shares to be issued, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

The price pressure here on the charts does show  a continuing sell as it dropped rapidly last time between a bid of 1.35p from a support of 2p. It has just broken that support  although early doors so has a possibility of further rapid downtrend if news doesn't land early in Q1. I love the oroducts and the management team but will hold a little back just in case. Let's hope tge big H comrs in soon hey! Cheers Swissy.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

I cannot see the SP above the issue price until the days after the shares have been placed in the market - it happens all the time. Admission, Settlement and Dealings Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM, being the market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is expected that admission of the New Ordinary Shares will take place on or around 8.00 a.m. 11 February 2026 and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares on AIM will commence at the same time. In addition to the passing of certain Resolutions at the General Meeting, the Placing and Subscription, are conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective. The Placing is not subject to clawback from the Retail Offer. Following Admission of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares and assuming the full take up of the Retail Offer, the Company will have 725,027,042 Ordinary Shares in issue. The New Ordinary Shares to be issued, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.",

          "content": "LONDON - GENinCode Plc (AIM:GENI), a predictive genetics company focused on cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer prevention, has secured an additional \u00a3580,000 through a subscription of 58 million new ordinary shares at 1 pence per share, the company announced Friday. This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities.

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities. The additional subscription shares will be issued using authority set out in resolutions proposed at the upcoming General Meeting and authority granted to directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on June 30, 2025. The terms of the additional subscription match those of the initial fundraising, including price and conditions. Admission of the new shares is expected on February 11, 2026, conditional on the passing of resolutions at the General Meeting. The cardiovascular and ovarian cancer-focused genetics company trades on London\u2019s AIM market under the ticker GENI.",

There is alot of  talk around my university campus of a big deal for this company A new collaboration with another 8 to 10 hospitals around North and South of London! It is a follow-on from this collaboration below, that has already been agreed I believe. \"Oxford, UK. GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the predictive genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (\"CVD\") and risk of ovarian cancer announces its collaboration with the North Central London (NCL) Cancer Alliance and University College\" From what I've researched and studied GENINCODE\u2019S technology is unique. I've heard this collaboration gossip from many people. I have no idea myself, but I'd not be surprised. The type of IP and technology GENinCode has is unbelievable and is well known amongst professors here! Hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f \u263a\ufe0f",

The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term.

With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care.

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

I cannot see the SP above the issue price until the days after the shares have been placed in the market - it happens all the time. Admission, Settlement and Dealings Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM, being the market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is expected that admission of the New Ordinary Shares will take place on or around 8.00 a.m. 11 February 2026 and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares on AIM will commence at the same time. In addition to the passing of certain Resolutions at the General Meeting, the Placing and Subscription, are conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective. The Placing is not subject to clawback from the Retail Offer. Following Admission of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares and assuming the full take up of the Retail Offer, the Company will have 725,027,042 Ordinary Shares in issue. The New Ordinary Shares to be issued, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.",

          "content": "LONDON - GENinCode Plc (AIM:GENI), a predictive genetics company focused on cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer prevention, has secured an additional \u00a3580,000 through a subscription of 58 million new ordinary shares at 1 pence per share, the company announced Friday. This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities. The additional subscription shares will be issued using authority set out in resolutions proposed at the upcoming General Meeting and authority granted to directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on June 30, 2025. The terms of the additional subscription match those of the initial fundraising, including price and conditions. Admission of the new shares is expected on February 11, 2026, conditional on the passing of resolutions at the General Meeting. The cardiovascular and ovarian cancer-focused genetics company trades on London\u2019s AIM market under the ticker GENI.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

Key upcoming catalysts include: US FDA De Novo Approval: The most significant potential catalyst is the expected approval of the CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae test by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is anticipated in Q1 2026, with some reports suggesting a potential for a \"10x fold\" increase in market cap. Expansion of US and EU Commercialization: Following a \u00a34.1m secondary placing in early 2025, the company is focused on scaling up, increasing sales volumes, and expanding its presence in the US and EU. Increased sales for LIPID inCode\u00ae, CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae, and THROMBO inCode\u00ae are expected to drive growth. New York State Health Department Approval: The company recently received approval from the New York State Department of Health to market its CARDIO inCode-Score test in that state, which, with a $500 average reimbursement value, is expected to boost commercial revenue. Partnerships and Clinical Data: Ongoing developments include seeking new distribution partnerships in the US and EU and presenting further clinical data (e.g., from Kaiser Permanente and the European Society of Cardiology) to support the adoption of their genetic risk assessment tools. Fundraising and Funding Runway: The company has recently taken steps to increase its cash reserves, with a retail offer and placing aimed at extending its cash runway to support US operations. Key Metrics & Forecasts: Analyst Outlook: The consensus is a \"Strong Buy\" with a 12-month target price of 7.50p, representing a significant potential upside from the February 2026 price of roughly 1.15p-1.19p. Revenue Growth: Analysts forecast that Genincode's revenue could grow by over 35% per annum.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Whoever this person is they have put substantial funds here. I have read that he is a founder of a top pharma in Spain but cant be sure if that its the same guy.

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

GENinCode has also entered a collaboration with Thermo Fisher to support broader adoption of its test portfolio, a development that could materially accelerate US growth. While NHS restructuring has delayed expansion in certain regions, the company continues to deliver on targets in Spain and Germany and is scaling its pilot programmes across Catalonia and Extremadura. With cardiovascular disease remaining the world\u2019s leading cause of mortality, the demand for predictive genetic tools is expected to rise. GENinCode now enters 2026 with improved scientific validation, expanding international sales channels and a regulatory pathway that, once completed, may unlock the company\u2019s most significant commercial opportunity to date.",

          "content": "Https://x.com/HotCommunities/status/2021233479162216592?s=20 (AIM: GENI) has experienced a volatile trading period in recent months, with the share price moving from 1.55 pence in mid-September to a peak of 4.45 pence in late October before retracing to 2.60 pence and stabilising near 1.15 pence at the time of writing. The rise was driven primarily by renewed market confidence following an update confirming progress in the FDA Supervisory Review of CARDIO inCode-Score, where the company clarified that outstanding issues had been reduced and a clear path forward had been agreed for additional submissions. Investor optimism was further supported by a statement addressing the share price movement, which highlighted continued commercial momentum in core markets, although it also made the market clear that the company was unaware of any specific recent for the recent share price rise. The subsequent decline reflected profit taking and conservative sentiment ahead of year end, particularly given delays in FDA approval and slower revenue recognition in the NHS. Despite this volatility, GENinCode remains positioned at the intersection of preventive cardiovascular genetics and expanding clinical demand. The company has reported meaningful operational progress across the first half of 2025, supported by strengthening revenues and expanding international adoption. According to its half year results, income rose 15 percent year on year to \u00a31.6 million, driven by the growth of LIPID inCode and CARDIO inCode-Score in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. More than forty US clinics now use the platform for coronary heart disease risk assessment, reflecting rising clinical interest in polygenic testing. Ongoing discussions with commercial partners aim to widen distribution once regulatory clearance for CARDIO inCode-Score is achieved. These developments indicate that revenue diversification is beginning to take shape across several major healthcare systems. Clinical and regulatory progress has remained central to the company\u2019s strategy, particularly in advancing its polygenic risk technologies. The FDA process surrounding CARDIO inCode-Score continues to evolve after the earlier assessment, with GENinCode reporting that remaining data requirements are well defined and expected to be addressed through a new submission in early 2026. Commercial and academic validation is also increasing, supported by a landmark study published in JACC Advances showing improved risk stratification through genetic scoring. Meanwhile, the ROCA ovarian cancer surveillance test has begun NHS deployment under a partnership with UCLH and the North Central London Cancer Alliance, creating a new clinical avenue for the company. Across Europe, sales of LIPID inCode and THROMBO inCode continue to expand in Spain, Italy and Germany.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

Key upcoming catalysts include: US FDA De Novo Approval: The most significant potential catalyst is the expected approval of the CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae test by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is anticipated in Q1 2026, with some reports suggesting a potential for a \"10x fold\" increase in market cap. Expansion of US and EU Commercialization: Following a \u00a34.1m secondary placing in early 2025, the company is focused on scaling up, increasing sales volumes, and expanding its presence in the US and EU. Increased sales for LIPID inCode\u00ae, CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae, and THROMBO inCode\u00ae are expected to drive growth. New York State Health Department Approval: The company recently received approval from the New York State Department of Health to market its CARDIO inCode-Score test in that state, which, with a $500 average reimbursement value, is expected to boost commercial revenue. Partnerships and Clinical Data: Ongoing developments include seeking new distribution partnerships in the US and EU and presenting further clinical data (e.g., from Kaiser Permanente and the European Society of Cardiology) to support the adoption of their genetic risk assessment tools. Fundraising and Funding Runway: The company has recently taken steps to increase its cash reserves, with a retail offer and placing aimed at extending its cash runway to support US operations. Key Metrics & Forecasts: Analyst Outlook: The consensus is a \"Strong Buy\" with a 12-month target price of 7.50p, representing a significant potential upside from the February 2026 price of roughly 1.15p-1.19p. Revenue Growth: Analysts forecast that Genincode's revenue could grow by over 35% per annum.",

This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities. The additional subscription shares will be issued using authority set out in resolutions proposed at the upcoming General Meeting and authority granted to directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on June 30, 2025. The terms of the additional subscription match those of the initial fundraising, including price and conditions. Admission of the new shares is expected on February 11, 2026, conditional on the passing of resolutions at the General Meeting. The cardiovascular and ovarian cancer-focused genetics company trades on London\u2019s AIM market under the ticker GENI.",

          "content": "LONDON - GENinCode Plc (AIM:GENI), a predictive genetics company focused on cardiovascular disease and ovarian cancer prevention, has secured an additional \u00a3580,000 through a subscription of 58 million new ordinary shares at 1 pence per share, the company announced Friday. This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities. The additional subscription shares will be issued using authority set out in resolutions proposed at the upcoming General Meeting and authority granted to directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on June 30, 2025. The terms of the additional subscription match those of the initial fundraising, including price and conditions. Admission of the new shares is expected on February 11, 2026, conditional on the passing of resolutions at the General Meeting. The cardiovascular and ovarian cancer-focused genetics company trades on London\u2019s AIM market under the ticker GENI.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

While NHS restructuring has delayed expansion in certain regions, the company continues to deliver on targets in Spain and Germany and is scaling its pilot programmes across Catalonia and Extremadura. With cardiovascular disease remaining the world\u2019s leading cause of mortality, the demand for predictive genetic tools is expected to rise. GENinCode now enters 2026 with improved scientific validation, expanding international sales channels and a regulatory pathway that, once completed, may unlock the company\u2019s most significant commercial opportunity to date.",

          "content": "Https://x.com/HotCommunities/status/2021233479162216592?s=20 (AIM: GENI) has experienced a volatile trading period in recent months, with the share price moving from 1.55 pence in mid-September to a peak of 4.45 pence in late October before retracing to 2.60 pence and stabilising near 1.15 pence at the time of writing. The rise was driven primarily by renewed market confidence following an update confirming progress in the FDA Supervisory Review of CARDIO inCode-Score, where the company clarified that outstanding issues had been reduced and a clear path forward had been agreed for additional submissions. Investor optimism was further supported by a statement addressing the share price movement, which highlighted continued commercial momentum in core markets, although it also made the market clear that the company was unaware of any specific recent for the recent share price rise. The subsequent decline reflected profit taking and conservative sentiment ahead of year end, particularly given delays in FDA approval and slower revenue recognition in the NHS. Despite this volatility, GENinCode remains positioned at the intersection of preventive cardiovascular genetics and expanding clinical demand. The company has reported meaningful operational progress across the first half of 2025, supported by strengthening revenues and expanding international adoption. According to its half year results, income rose 15 percent year on year to \u00a31.6 million, driven by the growth of LIPID inCode and CARDIO inCode-Score in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. More than forty US clinics now use the platform for coronary heart disease risk assessment, reflecting rising clinical interest in polygenic testing. Ongoing discussions with commercial partners aim to widen distribution once regulatory clearance for CARDIO inCode-Score is achieved. These developments indicate that revenue diversification is beginning to take shape across several major healthcare systems. Clinical and regulatory progress has remained central to the company\u2019s strategy, particularly in advancing its polygenic risk technologies. The FDA process surrounding CARDIO inCode-Score continues to evolve after the earlier assessment, with GENinCode reporting that remaining data requirements are well defined and expected to be addressed through a new submission in early 2026. Commercial and academic validation is also increasing, supported by a landmark study published in JACC Advances showing improved risk stratification through genetic scoring. Meanwhile, the ROCA ovarian cancer surveillance test has begun NHS deployment under a partnership with UCLH and the North Central London Cancer Alliance, creating a new clinical avenue for the company. Across Europe, sales of LIPID inCode and THROMBO inCode continue to expand in Spain, Italy and Germany.",

GENinCode has also entered a collaboration with Thermo Fisher to support broader adoption of its test portfolio, a development that could materially accelerate US growth. While NHS restructuring has delayed expansion in certain regions, the company continues to deliver on targets in Spain and Germany and is scaling its pilot programmes across Catalonia and Extremadura. With cardiovascular disease remaining the world\u2019s leading cause of mortality, the demand for predictive genetic tools is expected to rise. GENinCode now enters 2026 with improved scientific validation, expanding international sales channels and a regulatory pathway that, once completed, may unlock the company\u2019s most significant commercial opportunity to date.",

          "content": "Https://x.com/HotCommunities/status/2021233479162216592?s=20 (AIM: GENI) has experienced a volatile trading period in recent months, with the share price moving from 1.55 pence in mid-September to a peak of 4.45 pence in late October before retracing to 2.60 pence and stabilising near 1.15 pence at the time of writing. The rise was driven primarily by renewed market confidence following an update confirming progress in the FDA Supervisory Review of CARDIO inCode-Score, where the company clarified that outstanding issues had been reduced and a clear path forward had been agreed for additional submissions. Investor optimism was further supported by a statement addressing the share price movement, which highlighted continued commercial momentum in core markets, although it also made the market clear that the company was unaware of any specific recent for the recent share price rise. The subsequent decline reflected profit taking and conservative sentiment ahead of year end, particularly given delays in FDA approval and slower revenue recognition in the NHS. Despite this volatility, GENinCode remains positioned at the intersection of preventive cardiovascular genetics and expanding clinical demand. The company has reported meaningful operational progress across the first half of 2025, supported by strengthening revenues and expanding international adoption. According to its half year results, income rose 15 percent year on year to \u00a31.6 million, driven by the growth of LIPID inCode and CARDIO inCode-Score in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. More than forty US clinics now use the platform for coronary heart disease risk assessment, reflecting rising clinical interest in polygenic testing. Ongoing discussions with commercial partners aim to widen distribution once regulatory clearance for CARDIO inCode-Score is achieved. These developments indicate that revenue diversification is beginning to take shape across several major healthcare systems. Clinical and regulatory progress has remained central to the company\u2019s strategy, particularly in advancing its polygenic risk technologies. The FDA process surrounding CARDIO inCode-Score continues to evolve after the earlier assessment, with GENinCode reporting that remaining data requirements are well defined and expected to be addressed through a new submission in early 2026. Commercial and academic validation is also increasing, supported by a landmark study published in JACC Advances showing improved risk stratification through genetic scoring. Meanwhile, the ROCA ovarian cancer surveillance test has begun NHS deployment under a partnership with UCLH and the North Central London Cancer Alliance, creating a new clinical avenue for the company. Across Europe, sales of LIPID inCode and THROMBO inCode continue to expand in Spain, Italy and Germany.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

Key upcoming catalysts include: US FDA De Novo Approval: The most significant potential catalyst is the expected approval of the CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae test by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is anticipated in Q1 2026, with some reports suggesting a potential for a \"10x fold\" increase in market cap. Expansion of US and EU Commercialization: Following a \u00a34.1m secondary placing in early 2025, the company is focused on scaling up, increasing sales volumes, and expanding its presence in the US and EU. Increased sales for LIPID inCode\u00ae, CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae, and THROMBO inCode\u00ae are expected to drive growth. New York State Health Department Approval: The company recently received approval from the New York State Department of Health to market its CARDIO inCode-Score test in that state, which, with a $500 average reimbursement value, is expected to boost commercial revenue. Partnerships and Clinical Data: Ongoing developments include seeking new distribution partnerships in the US and EU and presenting further clinical data (e.g., from Kaiser Permanente and the European Society of Cardiology) to support the adoption of their genetic risk assessment tools. Fundraising and Funding Runway: The company has recently taken steps to increase its cash reserves, with a retail offer and placing aimed at extending its cash runway to support US operations. Key Metrics & Forecasts: Analyst Outlook: The consensus is a \"Strong Buy\" with a 12-month target price of 7.50p, representing a significant potential upside from the February 2026 price of roughly 1.15p-1.19p. Revenue Growth: Analysts forecast that Genincode's revenue could grow by over 35% per annum.",

There is alot of  talk around my university campus of a big deal for this company A new collaboration with another 8 to 10 hospitals around North and South of London! It is a follow-on from this collaboration below, that has already been agreed I believe. \"Oxford, UK. GENinCode Plc (AIM: GENI), the predictive genetics company focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (\"CVD\") and risk of ovarian cancer announces its collaboration with the North Central London (NCL) Cancer Alliance and University College\" From what I've researched and studied GENINCODE\u2019S technology is unique. I've heard this collaboration gossip from many people. I have no idea myself, but I'd not be surprised. The type of IP and technology GENinCode has is unbelievable and is well known amongst professors here! Hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f \u263a\ufe0f",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",

While NHS restructuring has delayed expansion in certain regions, the company continues to deliver on targets in Spain and Germany and is scaling its pilot programmes across Catalonia and Extremadura. With cardiovascular disease remaining the world\u2019s leading cause of mortality, the demand for predictive genetic tools is expected to rise. GENinCode now enters 2026 with improved scientific validation, expanding international sales channels and a regulatory pathway that, once completed, may unlock the company\u2019s most significant commercial opportunity to date.",

          "content": "Https://x.com/HotCommunities/status/2021233479162216592?s=20 (AIM: GENI) has experienced a volatile trading period in recent months, with the share price moving from 1.55 pence in mid-September to a peak of 4.45 pence in late October before retracing to 2.60 pence and stabilising near 1.15 pence at the time of writing. The rise was driven primarily by renewed market confidence following an update confirming progress in the FDA Supervisory Review of CARDIO inCode-Score, where the company clarified that outstanding issues had been reduced and a clear path forward had been agreed for additional submissions. Investor optimism was further supported by a statement addressing the share price movement, which highlighted continued commercial momentum in core markets, although it also made the market clear that the company was unaware of any specific recent for the recent share price rise. The subsequent decline reflected profit taking and conservative sentiment ahead of year end, particularly given delays in FDA approval and slower revenue recognition in the NHS. Despite this volatility, GENinCode remains positioned at the intersection of preventive cardiovascular genetics and expanding clinical demand. The company has reported meaningful operational progress across the first half of 2025, supported by strengthening revenues and expanding international adoption. According to its half year results, income rose 15 percent year on year to \u00a31.6 million, driven by the growth of LIPID inCode and CARDIO inCode-Score in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. More than forty US clinics now use the platform for coronary heart disease risk assessment, reflecting rising clinical interest in polygenic testing. Ongoing discussions with commercial partners aim to widen distribution once regulatory clearance for CARDIO inCode-Score is achieved. These developments indicate that revenue diversification is beginning to take shape across several major healthcare systems. Clinical and regulatory progress has remained central to the company\u2019s strategy, particularly in advancing its polygenic risk technologies. The FDA process surrounding CARDIO inCode-Score continues to evolve after the earlier assessment, with GENinCode reporting that remaining data requirements are well defined and expected to be addressed through a new submission in early 2026. Commercial and academic validation is also increasing, supported by a landmark study published in JACC Advances showing improved risk stratification through genetic scoring. Meanwhile, the ROCA ovarian cancer surveillance test has begun NHS deployment under a partnership with UCLH and the North Central London Cancer Alliance, creating a new clinical avenue for the company. Across Europe, sales of LIPID inCode and THROMBO inCode continue to expand in Spain, Italy and Germany.",

While NHS restructuring has delayed expansion in certain regions, the company continues to deliver on targets in Spain and Germany and is scaling its pilot programmes across Catalonia and Extremadura. With cardiovascular disease remaining the world\u2019s leading cause of mortality, the demand for predictive genetic tools is expected to rise.

          "content": "Https://x.com/HotCommunities/status/2021233479162216592?s=20 (AIM: GENI) has experienced a volatile trading period in recent months, with the share price moving from 1.55 pence in mid-September to a peak of 4.45 pence in late October before retracing to 2.60 pence and stabilising near 1.15 pence at the time of writing. The rise was driven primarily by renewed market confidence following an update confirming progress in the FDA Supervisory Review of CARDIO inCode-Score, where the company clarified that outstanding issues had been reduced and a clear path forward had been agreed for additional submissions. Investor optimism was further supported by a statement addressing the share price movement, which highlighted continued commercial momentum in core markets, although it also made the market clear that the company was unaware of any specific recent for the recent share price rise. The subsequent decline reflected profit taking and conservative sentiment ahead of year end, particularly given delays in FDA approval and slower revenue recognition in the NHS. Despite this volatility, GENinCode remains positioned at the intersection of preventive cardiovascular genetics and expanding clinical demand. The company has reported meaningful operational progress across the first half of 2025, supported by strengthening revenues and expanding international adoption. According to its half year results, income rose 15 percent year on year to \u00a31.6 million, driven by the growth of LIPID inCode and CARDIO inCode-Score in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. More than forty US clinics now use the platform for coronary heart disease risk assessment, reflecting rising clinical interest in polygenic testing. Ongoing discussions with commercial partners aim to widen distribution once regulatory clearance for CARDIO inCode-Score is achieved. These developments indicate that revenue diversification is beginning to take shape across several major healthcare systems. Clinical and regulatory progress has remained central to the company\u2019s strategy, particularly in advancing its polygenic risk technologies. The FDA process surrounding CARDIO inCode-Score continues to evolve after the earlier assessment, with GENinCode reporting that remaining data requirements are well defined and expected to be addressed through a new submission in early 2026. Commercial and academic validation is also increasing, supported by a landmark study published in JACC Advances showing improved risk stratification through genetic scoring. Meanwhile, the ROCA ovarian cancer surveillance test has begun NHS deployment under a partnership with UCLH and the North Central London Cancer Alliance, creating a new clinical avenue for the company. Across Europe, sales of LIPID inCode and THROMBO inCode continue to expand in Spain, Italy and Germany.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

          "content": "Genincode share price forecast The 12-month share price forecast for Genincode PLC (GENI) ranges from 7.50p to 11.50p, based on consensus estimates as of February 9, 2026. Currently trading at approximately 1.17p, these targets imply a significant potential upside of over 550% to 900%. Analyst Price Targets & Consensus Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus on Genincode, though coverage is limited to a small number of firms. Average Price Target: 7.50p. High Price Target: 11.50p. Low Price Target: 7.50p (some reports also mention a lower-tier target of 1.00p from specific technical platforms). Consensus Rating: Strong Buy. Key Insights & Market Context Recent Fundraising: Genincode recently completed a significant fundraising round in January 2026, issuing new shares at 1p each (a 47% discount to the previous market price) to extend its cash runway. Admission of these new shares to the AIM market is expected on February 11, 2026. Growth Potential: Revenue is forecast to grow by roughly 35.4% per annum, driven by its cardiovascular disease diagnostics, specifically the CARDIO inCode-Score test currently seeking FDA De Novo approval. Risk Profile: Despite the high upside potential, the stock is considered high-risk with volatile technical indicators. It has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by over 70% in the past year. Upcoming Catalysts: The next major financial event is the annual earnings report scheduled for June 4, 2026.",

          "content": "Based on recent reports, Genincode's (AIM: GENI) potential price catalysts are primarily driven by the commercialization of its cardiovascular and cancer genetic tests, particularly in the US market. Key upcoming catalysts include: US FDA De Novo Approval: The most significant potential catalyst is the expected approval of the CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae test by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is anticipated in Q1 2026, with some reports suggesting a potential for a \"10x fold\" increase in market cap. Expansion of US and EU Commercialization: Following a \u00a34.1m secondary placing in early 2025, the company is focused on scaling up, increasing sales volumes, and expanding its presence in the US and EU. Increased sales for LIPID inCode\u00ae, CARDIO inCode-Score\u00ae, and THROMBO inCode\u00ae are expected to drive growth. New York State Health Department Approval: The company recently received approval from the New York State Department of Health to market its CARDIO inCode-Score test in that state, which, with a $500 average reimbursement value, is expected to boost commercial revenue. Partnerships and Clinical Data: Ongoing developments include seeking new distribution partnerships in the US and EU and presenting further clinical data (e.g., from Kaiser Permanente and the European Society of Cardiology) to support the adoption of their genetic risk assessment tools. Fundraising and Funding Runway: The company has recently taken steps to increase its cash reserves, with a retail offer and placing aimed at extending its cash runway to support US operations. Key Metrics & Forecasts: Analyst Outlook: The consensus is a \"Strong Buy\" with a 12-month target price of 7.50p, representing a significant potential upside from the February 2026 price of roughly 1.15p-1.19p. Revenue Growth: Analysts forecast that Genincode's revenue could grow by over 35% per annum.",

This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities. The additional subscription shares will be issued using authority set out in resolutions proposed at the upcoming General Meeting and authority granted to directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on June 30, 2025. The terms of the additional subscription match those of the initial fundraising, including price and conditions. Admission of the new shares is expected on February 11, 2026, conditional on the passing of resolutions at the General Meeting. The cardiovascular and ovarian cancer-focused genetics company trades on London\u2019s AIM market under the ticker GENI.",

This additional subscription follows the company\u2019s initial fundraising announcement on January 21, bringing the total gross proceeds to approximately \u00a34.7 million. The company stated the additional funding would provide a longer cash runway as it works to provide updates to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its De Novo application for the CARDIO inCode-Score test. According to the press release, investor demand exceeded the amount raised, but GENinCode was limited by its existing authorities. The additional subscription shares will be issued using authority set out in resolutions proposed at the upcoming General Meeting and authority granted to directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on June 30, 2025. The terms of the additional subscription match those of the initial fundraising, including price and conditions. Admission of the new shares is expected on February 11, 2026, conditional on the passing of resolutions at the General Meeting. The cardiovascular and ovarian cancer-focused genetics company trades on London\u2019s AIM market under the ticker GENI.",

Significant investment has been made in technology and product development to advance the Company's mission of improving patient outcomes through predictive and preventive care. The Company has recently announced it is working with its partner, Thermo Fisher Scentific, to support its revenue scale-up and expansion strategy for its lead product CARDIO inCode-Score across Europe, the UK, and the United States which will assist the Company to transitioning towards break-even over the medium term. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17.9 million deaths annually, which equates to approximately 31% of all global deaths (World Health Organisation). With the global annual cost of CVD projected to surpass $1.04 trillion by 2030, the directors believe there is an unmet need to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing as an adjunct to the current standard of care. The directors believe GENinCode's proprietary solutions address this unmet need by integrating genetic and clinical data to improve risk prediction, risk assessment, and personalised treatment pathways for CVD and related conditions.",

          "content": "It may be sooner than Autumn - Near-Term Catalysts: With funding nearly in place and Thermo Fisher as a partner, GENinCode is poised for substantial news in the coming months. Potential 1\u20132 month catalysts include: Launch of Cardio inCode\u00ae testing in the UK/EU (first commercial sales could be announced now that approval is granted), progress updates on U.S. FDA submission plans (any positive signal or fast-track designation would be bullish), or additional partnership deals (Thermo Fisher covers certain markets; GENI might seek regional partners, e.g. in Asia). Also, results of the ongoing NHS pilot studies for their tests could be published, providing clinical validation. With such a low starting valuation, any indication of revenue ramp or wider adoption can have an outsized impact on the share price. Notably, once the new shares are admitted (expected ~11 Feb 2026), selling pressure from the placing may ease, and the stock could re-rate to reflect the company\u2019s improved outlook. A bounce back toward the pre-placing price (1.9p) would itself be +90%; surpassing it to 2+ pence (100%+ gain from 1p) is plausible if the market shifts focus to GENI\u2019s growth story with Thermo Fisher\u2019s backing rather than the recent dilution.",
