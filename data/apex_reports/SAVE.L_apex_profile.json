The Company may undertake further share buybacks opportunistically pursuant to the buyback authority granted by shareholders at the general meeting held on 28 November 2025, subject to the Company being in an open period and not being in possession of inside information and having regard to corporate liquidity and prevailing market conditions.\nUnder the Buyback Programme, the Company has repurchased a total of 32,063,641 ordinary shares in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") (the \"Buyback Shares\") at 6.8 pence per share for a total consideration of approximately \u00a32.18 million. The Company confirms that all of the Buyback Shares will be cancelled imminently.\nThe Buyback Programme was conducted in accordance with the authority granted to the Company by its shareholders at the general meeting held on 28 November 2025, which permits the purchase by the Company of up to\u00a0318,098,135 of its Ordinary Shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing completion of the Buyback Programme and the repurchase and cancellation of the Buyback Shares, the Company's issued share capital will consists of 2,088,590,594 Ordinary Shares (the \"Adjusted Share Capital\"). The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury and accordingly this will be the total number of voting rights and may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nNIPCO Plc Shareholding\nThe Company notes that, as at 5\u00a0February 2026, NIPCO Plc (\"NIPCO\"), the Company's largest shareholder, is now interested in 631,479,202 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 30.23% of the Company's voting share capital based on the Adjusted Share Capital, including through Purebond Limited's holding of 1.7 million shares in the Company. The 30% threshold was crossed as a result of the Buyback Programme (rather than through NIPCO acquiring further interests in shares) and, accordingly, in accordance with Note 1 on Rule 37.1 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Takeover Code\"). NIPCO is not required either now, or on completion of Unsettled Purchases (as defined below), to make a mandatory offer for the Company.\nThe current aggregate registered ownership of Ordinary Shares of NIPCO and Purebond represents approximately 27.93% of the Company's voting share capital based on the Adjusted Share Capital. The Company further notes that when NIPCO receives the approximately 48.15 million Ordinary Shares which have not yet settled pursuant to the acquisition of Ordinary Shares by NIPCO announced on 30 December 2025) (the \"Unsettled Purchases\"), the aggregate ownership of Ordinary Shares of NIPCO and Purebond will, following such settlement be approximately 30.23%.\nHowever, as NIPCO is now interested in more than 30%, but less than 50%, of the voting share capital of the Company based on the Adjusted Share Capital, NIPCO (and any of its concert parties) may not acquire a further interest in shares with voting rights in the Company without incurring an obligation under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code to make a mandatory offer.\nFor further information, please refer to the Company's website www.savannah-energy.com or contact:\nSavannah Energy\n+44 (0) 20 3817 9844\nAndrew Knott, CEO\nNick Beattie, CFO\nSally Marshak, Head of IR & Communications\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Spinney\nRitchie Balmer\nRob Patrick\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nDerrick Lee\nTim Redfern\nTennyson Securities (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 4530 9239\nPeter Krens\nCamarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4983\nBilly Clegg\nOwen Roberts\nViolet Wilson\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nAbout Savannah:\nSavannah Energy PLC is a British independent energy company focused around the delivery of\nProjects that Matter\nin\nAfrica.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

All figures are unaudited.\nAndrew Knott, CEO of Savannah, said:\n\"2025 was a year of execution for Savannah with good progress delivered across the nine focus areas we set out at the start of the year. In Nigeria, we\nincreased our rate of cash collections year-on-year by 12%, a trend which we hope to continue into 2026, and have made significant progress in refinancing our debt faci\nlities.\nIn our Hydrocarbons Division, the completion of the SIPEC acquisition in March enabled us to commence an expansion programme at Stubb Creek, increasing 2025 production materially above 2024 levels. At Uquo we delivered the new compression system under budget and advanced site construction ahead of the planned commencement of drilling of the new Uquo NE well. During the year, we also announced a 21% 2P Reserves upgrade at the Uquo gas field and a 29% upgrade to Stubb Creek oil field 2P Reserves. In Niger, we remain actively engaged with the Government on future activity, with the R3 East development plan significantly enhanced during the year.\nIn the power sector, we repositioned our business model and advanced both operating and development opportunities, including the proposed acquisition of interests in three East African hydropower projects, which is targeted for completion in H1 this year. We have also continued to progress on our wind, solar and hydro portfolio. Alongside this, we continue to pursue further value-accretive acquisitions across both hydrocarbons and power, with several other opportunities under active discussion.\nWe also continued to progress our arbitration claims, with the Savannah Chad Inc (\"SCI\") and Savannah Midstream Investment Limited (\"SMIL\") proceedings currently expected to be concluded in the first half of 2026.\nOverall, this progress provides a strong platform for continued delivery in 2026.\n\"\nHighlights\nOperational\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 average gross daily production of 18.8 Kboepd (FY 2024: 23.1 Kboepd), of which 83% was gas (FY 2024: 88%)1.\nFollowing completion of the SIPEC Acquisition in March 2025, commenced an 18-month expansion programme that saw Stubb Creek average gross daily production increase to 3.0 Kbopd in 2025, approximately 13% above the 2024 average;\n\u00b7\nWell site construction for the Uquo NE development well is expected to be completed this month.\nThe rig is ready for deployment, with mobilisation scheduled over the next few weeks\nand first gas targeted by the end of Q2 2026;\n\u00b7\nWell site preparation has commenced on the Uquo South exploration well;\n\u00b7\nNew compression system at the Uquo Central Processing Facility (\"CPF\") completed and fully commissioned. This project, which was delivered safely and approximately 10% under the original US$45 million budget, is expected to allow us to maximise the production from our existing and future gas wells;\n\u00b7\nGas contract extension agreed with the Central Horizon Gas Company Limited (\"CHGC\") to end December 2026 for up to 10 MMscfpd;\n\u00b7\nThe proposed acquisition of indirect interests in three East African hydropower projects is targeted to complete in H1 2026. The assets include the 255 MW Bujagali power plant, with a 13-year operating and payment track record, and two advanced-stage development projects, marking Savannah's potential for entry into five new countries - Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the \"DRC\"), Malawi and Rwanda;\n\u00b7\nContinuing to progress our existing priority Power Division projects, including the up to 250 MW Parc Eolien de la Tarka wind farm project in Niger and the up to 95 MW Bini a Warak hybrid hydroelectric and solar project in Cameroon;\n\u00b7\nSubject to a satisfactory agreement being reached with the Government of Niger\n, our subsidiary is considering commencing a four-well testing programme and/or a return to exploration activity in the R1234 PSC contract area in 2026/27; and\n\u00b7\nActively reviewing opportunities in both the thermal and renewable power sector, with the expectation of announcing\ntransaction(s) currently under consideration over the course of the next 24 months in the African power space.\nFinancial (unaudited)\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 cash collections increased by over 12% on the prior year to US$278.0 million (FY 2024: US$248.5 million) and this trend has continued into 2026 with cash collections during January 2026 of over US$64.4 million (January 2024: US$20.4 million);\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 Total Revenues2 of\nUS$235.0 million (FY 2024: US$258.9 million);\n\u00b7\nAs at 31 December 2025, cash balances were US$39.5 million (31 December 2024: US$32.6 million) and net debt stood at US$655.9 million (31 December 2024: US$636.9 million). Gross debt as at 31 December 2025 was US$698.4 million, of which only US$39.0 million (6%) was recourse to the Company, with the balance sitting within subsidiary companies on a non-recourse basis;\n\u00b7\nThe Trade Receivables balance as at 31 December 2025 was US$507.2 million, a 6% improvement on year-end 2024 (31 December 2024: US$538.9 million); and\n\u00b7\nFollowing the previously announced increase in the Accugas debt facility from NGN340 billion to up to approximately NGN772 billion (the \"Transitional Facility\"), a\ns at 31 December 2025, there was a remaining principal balance under the US$ Facility of approximately US$2 million, which has been repaid in early 2026.\nOperational Update\nHydrocarbons Division\nAverage gross daily production was 18.8 Kboepd for FY 2025 (FY 2024: 23.1 Kboepd), of which 83% was gas (FY 2025: 88%)1.\nOn 10 March 2025, we announced the completion of the SIPEC Acquisition. Following completion, we commenced a planned production expansion programme that saw Stubb Creek average gross daily production increase to 3.0 Kbopd in 2025, approximately 13% above the 2024 average. The full programme, expected to take up to 18 months, is anticipated to raise gross production to as much as 4.7 Kbopd. While the engineering stage of the facility expansion is well underway, an initial phase of the expansion programme is being fast-tracked to enable a faster production ramp-up anticipated by the end of Q1 2026.\nThe compression project at the Uquo CPF was completed and fully commissioned. This project, which was delivered approximately 10% under the original US$45 million budget, is expected to allow us to maximise the production from our existing and future gas wells.\nThe Company's Accugas subsidiary agreed a contract extension with CHGC to end December 2026 to supply up to 10 MMscfpd of gas. This represents the fourth such extension to the original contract signed with CHGC in February 2022. CHGC is a major gas distribution company situated in the South-South region of Nigeria, operating a 17 km gas pipeline infrastructure network providing natural gas to industrial and commercial users in the Trans Amadi Industrial Area of Port Harcourt as well as the greater Port Harcourt Area, Nigeria.\nThe timing for the Uquo NE development well has been updated. Well site construction is in the final stages and is expected to be completed this month. The rig is ready for deployment, with mobilisation scheduled over the next few weeks and first gas targeted by the end of Q2 2026. Uquo NE is forecast to deliver gas volumes of up to 80 MMscfpd.\nWell site\npreparation has also\ncommenced\non\nthe Uquo South\nexploration well, which\nis targeting an Unrisked Gross GIIP of 131 Bscf of incremental Prospective gas Resources on the Uquo licence area.\nThe Company notes the supportive public statements made by various officials of the Government of Nigeria during 2025 and into early 2026 regarding the Nigerian electricity sector, stating that His Excellency President Bola Tinubu approved a US$2.6 billion financing package to assist companies operating within the power industry settle outstanding verified invoices to power generation companies (\"Gencos\") and subsequently to gas supply companies. As part of this programme, the Government successfully issued a NGN590 billion first tranche sovereign bond in Q4 2025, as part of a wider NGN4 trillion bond programme to settle verified legacy invoices owed to Gencos and gas suppliers. This has created renewed positive momentum in the discussions Accugas Ltd, an 80% Savannah owned subsidiary, is having with its offtakers that are Gencos around the repayment of the Company's outstanding receivables balance in an accelerated manner.\nWe continue to actively engage with the Government of Niger around our forward work programme plans. Subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached with the Government, our subsidiary is considering commencing a four-well testing programme and/or a return to exploration activity in the R1234 PSC contract area in 2026/27. The R3 East development plan, itself, has been significantly re-worked since the last published Niger Competent Persons' Report (\"CPR\") of December 2021, with a plateau production rate of around 10 Kbopd now assumed (previously 5 Kbopd). The Company has updated its internal management estimates of the potential PV10 value (on an unrisked basis) at an asset level basis for R3 East to US$184.4 million (vs the last CPR asset value estimate of US$150 million). Assuming a successful well test programme is conducted, we would look to accelerate plans to commence commercial oil production from the R3 East Area and intend to incorporate the data acquired into our field development plan.\nPower Division\nIn 2025, we repositioned our power sector business model to pursue operating asset opportunities in both the thermal and renewable energy spaces alongside interests in large scale renewable energy development projects.\nProposed Acquisition of Three East African Hydropower Projects\nOn 19 September 2025, we announced the proposed acquisition of interests in three East African hydropower projects with the signing by our wholly owned subsidiary, Savannah Energy EA Limited, of a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") with Norfund, the Norwegian investment fund for developing countries, to acquire its current 50.1% interest in Klinchenberg for a total consideration of up to US$65.4 million (the \"Klinchenberg Transaction\"). Klinchenberg has interests in a portfolio of hydropower assets, as set out below:3\n\u00b7\nan indirect 13.6% interest in the operating 255 MW Bujagali run-of-river hydropower plant (\"Bujagali\") in Uganda;\n\u00b7\nan indirect 12.3% interest in the 361 MW Mpatamanga hydropower development project (\"Mpatamanga\") in Malawi; and\n\u00b7\nan indirect 9.8% interest in the 206 MW Ruzizi III hydropower development project (\"Ruzizi III\") spanning Burundi, the DRC and Rwanda.\nThe Klinchenberg Transaction is targeted to complete in H1 2026.\nGreenfield Projects in Development\nWe continue to progress our existing portfolio of wind, solar and hydroelectric projects, with our principal focus being on the\nup to 250 MW Parc Eolien de la Tarka project in Niger and the up to 95 MW Bini a Warak hybrid hydroelectric and solar project in Cameroon.\nOur Parc Eolien de la Tarka project made significant progress in 2025, with the Minister of Energy confirming that the project is on the Government's list of priority projects and, as such, is included in the Niger Energy Compact document adopted in Dar es Salaam during the\nMission 300 Africa Energy Summit\nheld in January 2025. We are continuing to progress the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment which we expect to complete and submit to the relevant authorities in early 2026. Having officially obtained favourable opinions for the project from both the regulator and the strategic agency in charge of PPPs, we continue to seek to negotiate outline terms in relation to the project's proposed power purchase agreement and continue to work on the project in close collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (World Bank) and the US International Development Finance Corporation.\nIn Cameroon, negotiations with the government are at an advanced stage regarding a Joint Development Agreement for the up to 95 MW Bini a Warak hybrid hydroelectric and solar project. This is expected to replace the Memorandum of Agreement signed in April 2023 and secure the terms under which Savannah will collaborate with the Government of Cameroon to develop the project further. We also plan to introduce a development partner to the project, alongside Savannah, during the next development phase\n.\nFuture M&A Activity\nThe Company continues to view mergers and acquisitions activity as a core driver of potential future value creation and is actively pursuing opportunities across both the hydrocarbon and renewable energy sectors.\nSavannah is in an exclusivity period in respect of the proposed acquisition of majority interests in a portfolio of renewable projects located in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an aggregate gross capacity in excess of 100 MW and a strong payment history. The proposed acquisition would also include a portfolio of renewable development projects in the same country with a targeted gross capacity of approximately 40 MW. The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources.\nThis proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident\nof announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the\nnext 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space.\nFinancial Update (unaudited)\nFY 2025 Performance Highlights\nFY 2025 cash collections increased by over 12% on the prior year to US$278.0 million (FY 2024: US$248.5 million) and this trend has continued into 2026 with cash collections during January 2026 of over US$64.4 million (January 2025: US$20.4 million).\nAs at 31 December 2025, cash balances were US$39.5 million (31 December 2024: US$32.6 million) and net debt stood at US$655.9 million (31 December 2024: US$636.9 million). This included debt associated with the SIPEC Acquisition and, for comparison purposes, if this were excluded, net debt would have reduced to US$613.1 million. It should be noted that only 6% of outstanding debt as at 31 December 2025 was recourse to the Company, with the balance sitting within subsidiary companies on a non-recourse basis.\nThe Trade Receivables balance as at 31 December 2025 was US$507.2 million, a 6% improvement on year-end 2024 (31 December 2024: US$538.9 million). This relates primarily to amounts due under various gas sales agreements in Nigeria. Delivering an increase in our rate of cash collections in Nigeria remains a key focus area for the business in 2026.\nDebt Facilities\nThe Transitional Facility was increased in October 2025 to up to approximately NGN772 billion enabling the remaining outstanding Accugas US$ debt balance to be converted into Naira. As at 31 December 2025, there was a remaining principal balance under the US$ Facility of approximately US$2 million, which was repaid in early 2026.\nArbitration Update\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, SCI, commenced arbitral proceedings in 2023 against the Government of the Republic of Chad in response to the March 2023 nationalisation of SCI's rights in the Doba fields in Chad, and other breaches of SCI's rights. Another wholly owned subsidiary, SMIL, commenced arbitral proceedings in 2023 in relation to the nationalisation of its investment in TOTCo, the Chadian company which owns and operates the section of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline located in Chad. SMIL has also commenced arbitral and other legal proceedings for breaches of SMIL's rights in relation to COTCo, the Cameroon company which owns and operates the section of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline located in Cameroon. We currently expect these arbitral proceedings to be concluded in the first half of 2026.\nSCI and SMIL are claiming in excess of US$775 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$215 million and costs) for the nationalisation of their rights and assets in Chad.4 SMIL has a claim valued at approximately US$330 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$67 million plus costs) for breaches of its rights in relation to COTCo.5 Whilst the Government of the Republic of Chad has acknowledged SCI's and SMIL's right to compensation, no compensation has been paid by the Government of the Republic of Chad to date. Savannah remains ready and willing to discuss with the Government of the Republic of Chad an amicable solution to the disputes. However, in the absence of such discussions, SCI and SMIL intend to vigorously pursue their rights in the arbitrations.\nSCI is involved in further arbitral proceedings in which designates of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Hydrocarbures du Tchad allege breaches by SCI of the Doba fields joint operating agreement.6 SCI is defending the claims vigorously. We currently expect these arbitral proceedings to be concluded in H2 2026.\nSubstantial Shareholder\nThe Company has been advised that its largest shareholder, NIPCO Plc (\"NIPCO\"), has yesterday purchased 59 million existing ordinary shares in the Company in the market. The Company announced on 30 December 2025 that NIPCO had acquired 148,314,064 existing ordinary shares pursuant to certain secondary market transactions,\nthereby increasing NIPCO's shareholding to approximately 26.5% of the Company's then issued share capital. As at today's date, whilst the majority of NIPCO's secondary market transactions have settled, certain of them, comprising approximately 48.15 million existing ordinary shares in aggregate, have yet to settle\n(the \"Unsettled Purchases\"). After taking account of yesterday's purchase, NIPCO is interested in 631,129,202 ordinary shares, and NIPCO's majority shareholder, Purebond Limited, is interested in 1,700,000 ordinary shares, in aggregate representing 29.84% of the Company's current issued share capital\n(including the shares in the Unsettled Purchases, which are anticipated to be delivered to NIPCO before the end of Q1 2026).\nCapital Allocation\nAs stated in the Company's update on 3 March 2025, Savannah's capital allocation policy remains unchanged. The Company intends to allocate any excess capital to its highest risk-adjusted return investment opportunities, assessed against the potential to return capital to shareholders. In this context, the Company has authority,\ngranted by shareholders at the general meeting held on 28 November 2025,\nto purchase up to 318,098,135 ordinary shares and may undertake share buybacks opportunistically, subject to the Company being in an open period and not being in possession of inside information, and having regard to corporate liquidity and prevailing market conditions.\nAIM Quotation Review Update\nAs announced on 22 October 2025, the Board initiated a review of the appropriateness of Savannah Energy PLC's current AIM quotation and potential alternative options available to the Company (the \"Review\").\nThe Company elected to defer formal consultation with shareholders to allow consideration of the potential implications (if any) of the\nShaping the Future of AIM\ninitiative. In this regard, AIM published its\nFeedback Statement: Shaping the Future of AIM\non 21 November 2025, setting out preliminary regulatory views on proposed reforms, including certain changes that may be implemented in the near term. Of particular relevance to Savannah, was the proposed amendment to the treatment of reverse takeovers, which the Company welcomes, given its previously stated view that such transactions can represent attractive opportunities for value-accretive growth but have historically been discouraged by the risk of prolonged suspension periods, particularly in jurisdictions where regulatory approvals are protracted.\nThe Review remains ongoing and is currently expected to progress through the first half of 2026, with timing influenced by the Board's desire to fully assess the proposed AIM rule changes. No decisions have been taken by the Board in relation to the outcome of the Review, which remains at an evaluative stage and is expected to be subject to consultation with shareholders prior to any conclusions being considered.\nFor further information, please refer to the Company's website www.savannah-energy.com or contact:\nSavannah Energy\n+44 (0) 20 3817 9844\nAndrew Knott, CEO\nNick Beattie, CFO\nSally Marshak, Head of IR & Communications\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Spinney\nRitchie Balmer\nRob Patrick\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nDerrick Lee\nTim Redfern\nTennyson Securities (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 4530 9239\nPeter Krens\nCamarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4983\nBilly Clegg\nOwen Roberts\nViolet Wilson\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nAbout Savannah:\nSavannah Energy PLC is a British independent energy company focused around the delivery of\nProjects that Matter\nin\nAfrica.\nFootnotes\n1.\nNote that gas production levels are largely driven by customer nomination levels, while cash collections are largely driven by contractual maintenance adjusted take-or-pay provisions of 117 MMscfpd in aggregate.\n2.\nTotal Revenues are defined as the total amount of invoiced sales during the period. This number is seen by management as more accurately reflecting the underlying cash generation capacity of the business as opposed to Revenue recognised in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n3.\nAll interests presented on an expected net to Savannah basis.\nPrior to completion of the Klinchenberg Transaction, it is expected that Klinchenberg will be restructured, such that Norfund will hold 100% of Klinchenberg and BII's indirect interests in Bujagali, Mpatamanga and Ruzizi will be moved to a new vehicle. At completion of the Klinchenberg Transaction, Savannah is, therefore, expected to acquire 100% of Klinchenberg.\n4.\nThe Republic of Chad has filed certain counterclaims in these proceedings, claiming in aggregate approximately US$699.1 million (without interest and costs). SCI and SMIL believe these counterclaims are baseless and without merit.\n5.\nThe Republic of Chad, SHT Overseas Petroleum (Cameroon) Limited (SHT), COTCo and certain other shareholders of COTCo have filed counterclaims in these proceedings, claiming in aggregate approximately US$58.7 million (without interest and costs). SMIL believes these claims are baseless and without merit.\n6.\nThe designates of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Hydrocarbures du Tchad have advanced various claims and seek an aggregate of between US$110.9 to US$136.9 million (without interest and costs).

In connection with these proposed acquisitions, the Company intends to terminate the off-market share buyback agreement (the \"Buyback Agreement\") announced on 22 October 2025 and approved by shareholders on 28 November 2025.\nFollowing termination of the Buyback Agreement, NIPCO proposes to acquire 118,083,927 of the 143,565,582 Ordinary Shares that were subject to the Buyback Agreement, which would increase NIPCO's stake to approximately 25% of the Company's current issued share capital.\nIn addition, NIPCO has indicated to the Company its intention to acquire up to a further approximately 1.5% of the Company's current issued share capital through additional secondary market transactions with identified existing shareholders. If completed in full, these additional acquisitions would increase NIPCO's ownership interest in Savannah to approximately 26.5% of the Company's current issued share capital. There can be no certainty such further acquisitions will occur and to the extent that they do occur, the Company would expect to update its website to reflect the increased ownership holding.\nThe Relationship Agreement\nThe proposed Relationship Agreement is expected to provide a number of important protections for the Company and its minority shareholders, and to ensure that the Company is at all times able to carry on its business independently of NIPCO.\nThe Relationship Agreement is expected to include: (i) undertakings by NIPCO to exercise its voting rights in support of Board-recommended governance-related shareholder resolutions; (ii) confirmation that NIPCO has no right to board representation; (iii) an undertaking from NIPCO not to pursue any hostile takeover of the Company (subject to certain exceptions); and (iv) orderly market disposal obligations governing any future disposals of shares by NIPCO, covering both on market and off market trades, with the Company being afforded a certain period of time in the latter instance to attempt to identify an alternative purchaser (should it so choose).\nThe Relationship Agreement is expected to remain in force for so long as NIPCO and its affiliates hold, in aggregate, 12.5% or more of the Company's issued share capital. Entry into the Relationship Agreement is expected to occur shortly following regulatory consultation, and NIPCO is expected to undertake to the Company imminently to agree to any amendments to the draft Relationship Agreement that may follow the regulatory consultation.\nBackground to termination of Buyback Agreement\nIn reaching its decision to terminate the Buyback Agreement, the Board, having taken appropriate external professional advice, concluded that the proposed entry into the Relationship Agreement would be of significant strategic value to the Company and its minority shareholders. In particular, the Board considered that: (1) the Relationship Agreement would deliver meaningful minority shareholder protections and provide important assurances regarding the Company's continued operational and decision-making independence from its largest shareholder; and (2) the proposed termination of the Buyback Agreement would preserve approximately \u00a310.05 million of the Company's cash resources (due to the Company not having to buyback the Ordinary Shares subject to the Buyback Agreement), enhancing financial flexibility while retaining the Company's ability to return capital to shareholders through Board-approved on-market share buybacks under the authority granted by shareholders at the general meeting held on 28 November 2025.\nDirector Share Purchase\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Knott (the \"CEO\"), proposes to acquire the balance of 25,481,655 Ordinary Shares that were subject to the Buyback Agreement and are not being acquired by NIPCO, thereby increasing his total interest to 292,764,370 Ordinary Shares, equal to approximately 13.8% of the Company's current issued share capital.

All figures are unaudited.\nThe Company is also pleased to announce a proposed fundraising, a conditional share buyback arrangement and a warrant cancellation agreement, further details on which are included below.\nAndrew Knott, CEO of Savannah, said:\n\"2025 has been a year of strong progress against the nine focus areas we set out at the beginning of the year. These include increasing our rate of cash collections in Nigeria, with performance remaining on track; advancing the refinancing of our principal Nigerian debt facilities, which we expect to complete by year-end; and successfully completing the acquisition of 100% of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Nigeria Limited in March.\nWe have also commenced the Stubb Creek expansion project, continued to advance our arbitral processes, and begun site construction ahead of the planned drilling of our Uquo development and exploration wells. In Niger, discussions on the R3 East development are progressing, while in the power sector we have refined our business model to align with future growth opportunities. Finally, we continue to pursue further value-accretive acquisitions across both the oil and gas and power sectors, with the Norfund transaction already announced and several other opportunities under active discussion.\nAdditionally, earlier in the year, the Company reported a 21% 2P Reserves upgrade on its Uquo gas field and a 29% upgrade on its Stubb Creek oil field 2P Reserves. Collectively, these developments demonstrate the strong operational momentum within the Group and our continued focus on disciplined execution across all parts of the business.\nWe are also pleased to welcome NIPCO Plc (\"NIPCO\" or the \"New Investor\"), a diversified Nigerian energy conglomerate, as a potential new investor in the Company, who we expect to own approximately 19.4% of the Company following completion of their primary investment and certain secondary share transactions. The proceeds of the New Investor's primary investment are expected to enable, among other things, the advancement of certain business development opportunities currently under consideration. Coupled with the imminent completion of the primary investment I committed to in March 2025, a series of secondary transactions, which are expected to occur today, are anticipated to increase my shareholding in the Company to approximately 12.6%, demonstrating my continued strong faith in the Company's future potential.1\nIn addition, we are pleased to announce that should we see a significant improvement in cash collections- and/or receive meaningful proceeds from the arbitral processes we are engaged in, it is the Board's present intention to consider returning a portion of such funds to shareholders through a tender offer or share buy-back, subject to prevailing capital requirements and shareholder and regulatory approvals. In this vein, today we are also announcing the signature of a conditional off-market share buyback agreement for approximately 6.8% of the Company's enlarged share capital, to acquire shares prior to 31 March 2026. We are also announcing the proposed cancellation of warrants over approximately 101 million shares.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to all thos",

The Company is currently conducting a comprehensive audit tender process covering both the Group and its Nigerian subsidiaries. This appointment process is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nChief Executive Officer's Review\nDelivering on our key opportunities in African energy\nDear fellow shareholders,\nI would like to welcome you to our 11th Annual Report as a listed company, marking more than a decade of Savannah delivering\nProjects that Matter\nin Africa. This year's letter follows a similar format to those of recent years. The first section discusses the global business environment in 2024. The second section discusses our Company's continued strong financial, operational and sustainability performance in 2024. The third section discusses key business priorities for the year ahead. The last section talks about the \"how\" and the \"why\" we see the African energy transition evolving and discusses the relevance of our hydrocarbon AND renewable energy strategy.\nBefore turning to the first section, I would like to draw your attention to two guest authored articles in this year's Annual Report. The first (on page 17) is authored by Hon. Wale Edun, Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy of Nigeria and discusses his views on\n\"Unlocking Opportunities Across the Economy\"\n(originally published in\nForbes Afric\na\n). The second article (on pages 27 to 33) is authored by Daniel Yergin, Peter Orzag and Atul Arya,\n\"The Troubled Energy Transition\"\n(originally published in\nForeign Affairs\n), who make an articulate argument that we are now experiencing an \"energy addition\" as opposed to an \"energy transition\", with their critical observation that \"throughout history, no energy source, including traditional biomass, has declined globally in absolute terms over an extended period\". We are extremely grateful to our distinguished guest authors for their contributions.\nI would also like to highlight on pages 8 to 15 a discussion of \"Why we do what we do\", which focuses on our corporate purpose and the associated core beliefs which serve to underpin our strategy and business model. I really believe that this section is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand our Company.\n2024 Global Business Environment\nThe global economy remained relatively stable in 2024. Although the OECD\n1\n, and Africa\n2\nrecorded different GDP growth rates, both showed a similar year-on-year trend of consistent growth. Oil prices remained broadly flat, with the Brent crude benchmark declining by a modest 1.2%.\n3\nGlobal LNG prices fell by approximately 15% (although they remained elevated by historical standards).\n4\nResults were burdened by weak refining\n5,6\nand chemicals margins\n7,8\nin 2024, as supply significantly outpaced demand growth. Developed economies experienced a notable decline in inflation from an average of 4.8% in 2023 to an estimated 2.6% in 2024\n2\n, while inflation across African nations remained persistently high at 16.6% in 2023 versus 16.1% in 2024.\nAgainst this backdrop, Nigeria saw a significant increase in inflation in 2024 (29% versus 25% in 2023)\n9\nalongside a substantial 40% depreciation of the Naira against the US$.\n10\nThis was largely driven by the transitional impact of market-oriented government policy changes, including a removal of fuel subsidies and the switch from a managed to a floating exchange rate regime.\n11\nWe believe that these policies, together with the Government's stated objective to increase oil production (which contributes approximately 65% of Government revenue and 85% of total exports\n12\n) by approxi",

The SPA is expected to be signed later this morning during a ceremony to be attended by John Humphrey, His Majesty's Trade Commissioner for Africa.\nKlinchenberg is\na joint venture company currently owned by Norfund (50.1%) and British International Investment (\"BII\") (49.9%), the UK's development finance institution. Klinchenberg has interests in a portfolio of hydropower assets, as set out below:\n1\n\u00b7\nan indirect 13.6% interest in the operating 255 MW Bujagali run-of-river hydropower plant (\"Bujagali\") in Uganda;\n\u00b7\nan indirect 12.3% interest\nin the 361 MW Mpatamanga hydropower development project (\"Mpatamanga\") in Malawi; and\n\u00b7\nan indirect 9.8% interest in the 206 MW Ruzizi III hydropower development project (\"Ruzizi III\") spanning Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the \"DRC\") and Rwanda.\nNote: All interests presented on an expected net to Savannah basis.\nThe Consideration includes a US$6.8 million deferred cash element, payable three years post-completion of the Transaction, and contingent payments in respect of Mpatamanga and Ruzizi III payable upon financial close of these projects. The Transaction is\nsubject to customary adjustments upon completion and is expected to complete no earlier than Q1 2026. The SPA has an economic effective date of 31 December 2024. The Consideration is expected to be funded by Savannah Energy EA through a new US$37.4 million debt facility, arranged by a leading international bank, and the existing cash resources of the Company.\nAbout Bujagali\nLocated on the Victoria Nile in eastern Uganda, Bujagali is a 255 MW run-of-river hydropower plant, commissioned in 2012, which contributes approximately 31% of Uganda's effective electricity generation capacity, producing approximately 1,490 GWh of power annually. It benefits from a US dollar-denominated power purchase agreement with the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited, Uganda's principal power transmission utility, maturing in 2042.\nProject partners in Bujagali include a subsidiary of TotalEnergies (the French energy supermajor), BII, AKDN (the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development), the International Finance Corporation (the \"IFC\", a member of the World Bank Group), DEG (the Germany-owned investment company), Jubilee Holdings Limited (the East African financial services conglomerate) and the Government of Uganda.\nFor more information on Bujagali see: https://www.bujagali-energy.com\nAbout Mpatamanga\nLocated on the Shire River in southern Malawi, the Mpatamanga hydropower project is a planned 361 MW traditional reservoir power plant. Mpatamanga is designed to double Malawi's current installed generation capacity and materially reduce dependence on diesel-fired generation. Financial close is targeted for 2026, with the project expected to be financed through a combination of concessional and commercial debt alongside equity contributions from the sponsors, underpinned by World Bank guarantee structures. Once operational, Mpatamanga is expected to deliver robust cash flows through long-term offtake agreements with the Government of Malawi and a US dollar\n-linked\ntariff.\nProject partners in Mpatamanga include the IFC, EDF (the French utility major), BII, a subsidiary of TotalEnergies and the Government of Malawi.\nFor more information on Mpatamanga see: https://www.mpatamangahydro.com\nAbout Ruzizi III\nLocated on the Ruzizi River between Burundi, the DRC and Rwanda, the Ruzizi III hydropower project is a planned 206 MW run-of-river power plant. The project is designed to supply electricity to Burundi, the DRC and Rwanda under long-term, government-backed, take-or-pay power purchase agreements, providing predictable US dollar-denominated revenues.\nOnce operational, Ruzizi III is expected to nearly double Burundi's electricity generation capacity, increase Rwanda's installed capacity by approximately 30%, and deliver much-needed reliable baseload power to eastern DRC.\nRuzizi III is expected to reach financial close in 2026, supported by a multi-lateral financing package with participation from the World Bank and other development finance institutions.\nProject partners in",

F\nollowing completion of the SIPEC Acquisition in March 2025, we commenced an 18-month expansion programme that has already increased current Stubb Creek gross daily production to 3.2 Kbopd, approximately 20% above the 2024 average;\n\u00b7\nNew compression system at the Uquo Central Processing Facility (\"CPF\") completed and fully commissioned. This project, which was delivered safely and approximately 10% under the original US$45 million budget, will allow us to maximise the production from our existing and future gas wells;\n\u00b7\nTurnkey drilling c\nontract signed and the procurement process of other long lead equipment progressing, in preparation for an up to two-well drilling campaign on the Uquo Field, scheduled to commence in January 2026, with first gas targeted by the end of that quarter;\n\u00b7\nAgreements expected to be signed shortly with a consortium of five Nigerian banks in respect of an increase in the Accugas debt facility from NGN340 billion (approximately US$222 million) to up to approximately NGN772 billion (approximately US$503 million) (the \"Transitional Facility\"). It is expected that the upsized facility will be utilised to enable the remaining outstanding balance of the Accugas US$ Facility to be repaid during H2 2025;\n\u00b7\nConti",

All figures are unaudited.\nAndrew Knott, CEO of Savannah Energy, said:\n\"\nI am pleased to provide a Q1 2025 trading update, highlighting good progress in our core objectives for the year, including a 19% increase in Total Revenues1, and a continued strong trend in cash collections with almost US$125 million received in the quarter. We are also reporting that, since completion of the SIPEC Acquisition, production at the Stubb Creek oil field (\"Stubb Creek\") has increased by approximately 15% and 2P oil reserves have been upgraded by 29%. Our planned Uquo Field drilling campaign, set to commence in Q4, has the potential to add further reserves, resources and production capacity which would be capable of easy and quick monetisation.\n2025 continues to be an exciting year for the business and we continue to work towards \"ticking-off\" the delivery of the nine focus area projects that we outlined at the beginning of the year, being: (1) securing a further increase in our rate of cash collections in Nigeria2; (2) completion of the refinancing of our principal Nigerian debt facilities; (3) completion of the planned acquisition of 100% of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Nigeria Limited (the \"SIPEC Acquisition\") which was achieved during Q1 2025; (4) commencement of the Stubb Creek expansion project (which we updated on today); (5) the advancement of our Chad/Cameroon arbitration processes3; (6) the commencement of the safe and successful drilling of our planned Uquo development well and potential Uquo exploration well; (7) the potential advancement of our R3 East development in Niger4; (8) the refinement of our power sector business model; and (9) the delivery of further transformational acquisitions.\nI would also highlight that we anticipate achieving a strong increase in cash collections in 2025 (even when set against our long-term 13% CAGR5), with significant production capacity growth expected in 2026 once our heavy Uquo field investment programme is completed.\nI look forward to reporting further progress towards the achievement of many of our focus area projects when we announce our full year 2024 results in June.\"\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nQ1 2025 Total Revenues1 of\nUS$73.3 million, up 19% (Q1 2024: US$61.4 million), which includes a contribution of approximately US$3.6 million from Stubb Creek following completion of the\nSIPEC Acquisition\n;\n\u00b7\nQ1 2025 cash collections of US$124.8 million, an increase of 6% (Q1 2024: US$117.7 million). As at 31 March 2025, cash balances were US$110.4 million (31 December 2024: US$32.6 million) and net debt stood at US$597.8 million (31 December 2024: US$636.9 million). This included debt associated with the SIPEC Acquisition and, for comparison purposes, if this was excluded, the net debt would have further reduced to US$570 million;\n\u00b7\nQ1 2025 gross production at Stubb Creek was 2.8 Kbopd (Q1 2024: 2.5 Kbopd) and, following completion of the SIPEC Acquisition during the quarter, we have commenced an up to 18-month expansion programme anticipated to increase gross production to approximately 4.7 Kbopd. During April 2025 we have already seen an increase of 15% in Stubb Creek gross production to an average of 3.1 Kbopd compared to the average 2024 level;\n\u00b7\nIncreases of 197% and 29% in Stubb Creek Gross 1P and 2P oil Reserves, respectively, due to an improved ultimate field recovery factor, as determined through the implementation of enhanced field monitoring protocols and advanced reservoir modelling. This follows a similar 27% increase in Uquo Field Gross 2P Reserves announced in November 2021;\n\u00b7\nAverage gross daily production of 23.6 Kboepd for Q1 2025, broadly in line with the prior year period (Q1 2024: 24.1 Kboepd);\n\u00b7\nCompletion of an equity issuance raising, in aggregate, gross proceeds of approximately \u00a330.6 million and the signing of a US$200 million acquisition debt facility providing access to potential funding for future hydrocarbon asset acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nProcurement process of long lead equipment progressing in Nigeria in preparation for a potential two-well drilling campaign on the Uquo Field commencing in Q4 2025. Equipment orders have been placed for a development well which is expected to add up to 80 MMscfpd of production capacity. An additional exploration well remains under consideration targeting an Unrisked Gross gas initially in place (\"GIIP\") of 154 Bscf (25.7 MMboe) of incremental gas resources;\nand\n\u00b7\nContinuing to seek to progress the 35 MMstb (Gross 2C Resources) R3 East oil development in South-East Niger, subject to satisfactory stakeholder agreements being entered into.\nOperational update\nHydrocarbons Division\nNigeria Exis",

At completion the cumulative consideration paid was approximately US$35.1 million (inclusive of approximately US$19.5 million of cash available to SIPEC), with US$2 million in deferred cash consideration payable in eight quarterly instalments post-completion.\nAbout Stubb Creek Field\nStubb Creek Field, located in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, is a producing oil field with considerable undeveloped, non-associated 2C gas Resources. As at year end 2024, Stubb Creek Field had an estimated 11 MMstb of 2P\u00a0gross oil Reserves and 515 Bscf of 2C gross gas Resources1. Commercial oil production started at Stubb Creek Field in 2015, with cumulative production of 8.1 MMstb to 31 December 2024. Oil produced at Stubb Creek Field is processed through production facilities onsite and then exported to the Qua Iboe terminal via a 25 km pipeline. The Stubb Creek Field was converted to a 20-year petroleum mining lease, PML20, in accordance with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 and effective from 1 December 2023.\nSavannah's Stubb Creek Field, Oil Processing Facility, Nigeria\nAndrew Knott, Chief Executive Officer of Savannah, said:\n\"We are delighted to announce the completion of the SIPEC Acquisition - the achievement of one of our core business priorities for 2025. Our focus at the Stubb Creek Field will now turn to progressing the expansion project, which we expect to increase production by almost three quarters over the course of 2025/26. I look forward to updating shareholders on this in the coming months, as well as on the progress we make towards achieving the other core business priorities we outlined to shareholders earlier this month.\nI would like to thank the Government of Nigeria for the support that they have shown our Company in approving the SIPEC Acquisition and I extend a warm welcome to the SIPEC employees joining Savannah today.\"\nFor further information, please refer to the Company's website www.savannah-energy.com or contact:\nSavannah Energy\n+44 (0) 20 3817 9844\nAndrew Knott, CEO\nNick Beattie, CFO\nSally Marshak, Head of IR & Communications\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Spinney\nRitchie Balmer\nRob Patrick\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nDerrick Lee\nTim Redfern\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3100 2000\nScott Mathieson\nJames Sinclair-Ford\nCamarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4983\nBilly Clegg\nOwen Roberts\nViolet Wilson\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\").\nDr Christophe Ribeiro, Savannah's VP Technical, has approved the technical disclosure in relation to Savannah's oil and gas Reserves and Resources in this regulatory announcement in his capacity as a qualified person under the AIM Rules.

The Company also provides the following financial and operational update.\nAndrew Knott, CEO of Savannah Energy, said:\n\"Today we are announcing our intention to undertake a Fundraising by way of a subscription of new Ordinary Shares. We are also providing a comprehensive operational and financial update, including announcing that a new US$200m hydrocarbon asset acquisition facility has been signed. All of which is expected to lay a strong foundation for the delivery of our 2025 - 2030 organic and inorganic growth plans.\nThis is an exciting time for Savannah. Our core Nigerian business remains extremely robust: as at end 2024 we had US$3.4bn of contracted future revenues in our gas business with a weighted average contract life of 13 years and a 25-year reserve and resource life. This business has seen double-digit compound annual Adjusted EBITDA1 and cash collections growth over the course of the past eight years.\nThere are nine key focus areas in our business over the course of the next 12 months: (1) delivering a further increase in our rate of cash collections in Nigeria2; (2) completion of the refinancing of our principal Nigerian debt facilities; (3) completion of the planned acquisition of 100% of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Nigeria Limited (the \"SIPEC Acquisition\"); (4) commencement of the Stubb Creek expansion project; (5) the advancement of our Chad/Cameroon arbitration processes3; (6) the commencement of the safe and successful drilling of our Uquo development and exploration wells; (7) the potential advancement of our R3 East development in Niger4; (8) the refinement of our power sector business model; and (9) the delivery of further transformational acquisitions.\nGiven our planned activity levels this year, our capital allocation policy remains unchanged: we intend to allocate our excess capital to our highest risk-adjusted return investment opportunities, assessing doing so against the potential to make distributions to shareholders. We will continue to review our approach to capital allocation as the business develops.\nLastly, I would like to express my gratitude to our shareholders and lenders for their support, as well as to our incredibly passionate and dedicated employees for the contributions they have made to our Company's successes achieved to date. I look forward to updating our shareholders as we progress on the delivery of our focus projects throughout the year.

Calabar Generation Company (Calabar GenCo): A major Accugas customer, owned by Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), a government entity under the Federal Ministry of Power. Accugas also supplies gas to several National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) stations, many of which are government\u2011owned or managed through NDPHC (e.g. Ibom Power, though partially private). Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), a government corporation, acts as intermediary/guarantor for payments to GenCos, and thus indirectly to gas suppliers like Accugas when GenCos can't pay. So there is a strong tie-in between the govt.and Accugas. Calabar is it's biggest customer so hopefully payments to Calabar will filter through to Savannah. Gas suppliers (Accugas) are mentioned specifically in the Power Gen bond prospectus but I've not seen any direct reference to them so far regarding payments. Hopefully we'll get some sort of an update soon from Save clarifying things.",

          "content": "Https://guardian.ng/featured/fg-issues-n501b-inaugural-power-sector-bond-to-clear-gencos-debts/ Federal Government of Nigeria has issued a N501 billion inaugural bond under the Presidential Power Sector Debt Reduction Programme (PPSDRP), recording 100 per cent subscription from pension funds, banks, asset managers, and other investors, marking a significant step towards resolving legacy debts, restoring liquidity, and strengthening confidence in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The programme, championed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is designed to address long-standing payment arrears owed to power generation companies, which for over a decade constrained liquidity, weakened balance sheets, and discouraged investment across the power sector value chain. The signing follows the successful completion of Series 1 Power Sector Bond Issuance by NBET Finance Company Plc. The Series 1 issuance closed at N501 billion, comprising N300 billion raised from the capital markets and N201 billion in bonds allotted to participating power generation companies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the reform agenda. Under the programme, verified receivables for electricity supplied between February 2015 and March 2025 are being settled through negotiated agreements with power generation companies. To date, five power generation companies representing fourteen power plants nationwide \u2013 First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), Geregu Power Plc, Ibom Power Company Limited, Mabon Limited, and Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) \u2013 have executed Settlement Agreements with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET).The total negotiated settlement amount for these companies stands at N827.16 billion, to be paid in four phased instalments. Proceeds from the Series 1 issuance will fund the first and second instalment payments to participating power generation companies with signed Settlement Agreements, estimated at N421.42 billion, representing approximately 50 per cent of the total negotiated settlement amount. Payments for this initial phase will be made through a mix of cash and notes. Speaking at the bond issuance signing ceremony in Lagos on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Arowolo Verheijen, stated that the programme represents a decisive reset of the electricity market, combining debt resolution with broader financial and structural reforms. Verheijen commended the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, as well as the support of the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, in making the PPSDRP a reality......",

          "content": "... Seplat Energy\u2019s (NGX: SEPLAT, LSE: SEPL) shares rose 6.2% on the NGX in the first trading week of 2026, reaching a 52-week high of NGN6,171 ($4.33), after Heirs Energies acquired a significant minority stake in the Nigerian oil and gas producer. Seplat is a Nigerian independent oil and gas company focused on the development and production of hydrocarbons in the Niger Delta. The rally followed Heirs Energies\u2019 acquisition of a 20.07% stake previously held by Maurel & Prom S.A., a transaction valued at about $500mn. The deal involved 120.4mn shares priced at \u00a33.05 ($4.09) each and was completed in late 2025. Investors viewed the purchase as a long-term endorsement of Seplat Energy\u2019s assets and growth strategy. Seplat Energy reported strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2025. Revenue rose 213% year on year to NGN3.36 trillion ($2.35bn), exceeding the company\u2019s combined revenue from 2020 to 2024. Operating profit before tax increased to NGN879bn ($616mn) from NGN367bn ($257mn) a year earlier. Net profit, however, declined to NGN147bn ($103mn) following a tax charge of NGN732bn ($513mn). Despite the higher tax burden, shareholder returns improved. Earnings per share rose 144% to NGN240.18. Dividends declared by the third quarter of 2025 amounted to 167 cents per share, or NGN157bn ($110mn), maintaining Seplat\u2019s position as one of the Nigerian Exchange\u2019s regular dividend-paying energy companies. Operational performance was driven by a 231% increase in crude oil sales to NGN3.1 trillion ($2.17bn). Output growth followed the integration of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited\u2019s offshore assets, which added more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well restoration activities contributed an additional 33,400 barrels per day. Although oil prices fell 13% during the period, total lifted volumes increased 270% to 27.9mn barrels. Gas revenue rose to NGN215bn ($151mn), supported by liquefied petroleum gas exports and condensate sales valued at NGN51bn ($36mn). Seplat Energy has set a target to double production to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, supported by planned capital expenditure of $2.5bn-$3bn. The company has said it expects to generate $5bn-$6bn in free cash flow and distribute up to $1bn in dividends over the period.",

The acquisition was completed through the BlueCore Gas InfraCo consortium \u2013 comprising Levene Energy, Afrigaz Energie, Energy& LLP and emPERSAND \u2013 and marks a key step in Levene Energy\u2019s transition from oil and refined products into a fully integrated and infrastructure-backed clean energy company. Through the transaction, the BlueCore consortium has acquired 100% of Axxela, purchasing the interests of Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation in a deal valued at approximately $285 million. The acquisition was supported by a structural debt and equity financing package arranged by Standard Bank. The acquisition aligns with BlueCore\u2019s strategy to scale gas and power infrastructure across West Africa, while positioning Levene Energy to participate in long-term energy transition assets supporting industrial demand and regional energy security. https://energycapitalpower.com/levene-energy-enters-nigerias-gas-market-with-axxela-equity-deal/ 9-1-2026 BlueCore acquires Axxela, signals confidence in Nigeria\u2019s gas infrastructure BlueCore Gas InfraCo Limited has completed the acquisition of Axxela Limited, a leading gas and power infrastructure company, from international owners Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation. The transaction highlighted the growing bankability of Nigeria\u2019s midstream gas assets, which are critical for power generation, industrial activity, and national energy security. Market participants view gas as a key transition fuel, enabling reliable power, reducing diesel use, and cutting gas flaring. \u201cThis transaction reflects a broader shift in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure investment landscape, where well-run operating assets are increasingly able to attract domestic long-term institutional capital,\u201d said Dolu Olugbenjo of Stanbic IBTC Asset Management. https://businessday.ng/energy/article/bluecore-acquires-axxela-signals-confidence-in-nigerias-gas-infrastructure/ For reference SAVE supply gas to an Axxela subsiduary.",

A few snippets - read the article for full details https://businessday.ng/energy/power/article/power-firms-turning-page-on-debt-as-fg-clears-arrears-sahara/ Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group, has said Nigeria\u2019s power sector is entering a more stable and investable phase, driven by Federal Government reforms and the gradual resolution of legacy debts that have long constrained growth across the electricity value chain. Adesina, during an interview, pointed out that recent infrastructure and macroeconomic policies under President Bola Tinubu had introduced a level of clarity and predictability that is reshaping investment decisions in the sector. He noted that the Administration\u2019s approach had helped address structural bottlenecks that previously undermined investor confidence. Besides, Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had already settled $438 million, about 73% of its original $600 million loan obligation, despite long standing liquidity challenges in the industry. According to him, the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing legacy debt settlement programme is critical to easing pressure on power companies, gas suppliers and lenders, while creating room for new capital inflows. He explained that improved policy coordination, relative exchange rate stability, easing inflationary pressures and moderated interest rates are allowing power sector operators to plan with greater conviction. Adesina added that the developments, combined with closer collaboration among government agencies, regulators, financiers and industry players, are laying the foundation for sustained growth and operational stability in Nigeria\u2019s electricity market. Sahara Power is Nigeria\u2019s foremost power company, responsible for about 19 per cent of total power generated in the nation. Its subsidiaries include Egbin Power Plc, the largest thermal power plant in sub Saharan Africa, First Independent Power Limited, a leading generating company in the Niger Delta, and Ikeja Electric, the largest privately run distribution company in sub-Saharan Africa. Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had undertaken extensive scenario planning and aligned its strategic objectives with what he described as the president\u2019s bold, clear-sighted and long-term oriented infrastructure plan. According to him, the administration has shown uncommon resolve in tackling structural bottlenecks that have historically constrained investment, particularly in the energy value chain.",

In Petronas accounts they were 'held for sale'. SHT pre-empted, as was their right, implying they paid the same as the Savannah offer. Perenco were apparently involved in financing the purchase. The sale was completed with a ceremony in Kuala Lumpar, and Petronas accounts stated 'no material effect' upon disposal, implying price received was similar to carrying value. This sets a precedent and a price on the Exxon/Savannah assets, and Savannah state that Chad admit that compensation is owed. Meanwhile the oil minister has changed since the nationalisation. Ndolenodji Alixe Naimbaye has no history of supporting nationalisation, and is currently trying to attract investment, for example SEMICA 2026 in January,  EGYPES in March. The World Bank is involved in financing several energy projects in Chad, eg Scatec $100m, PAAET $295m. The US is the largest shareholder in the World Bank, and we now know how Trump feels about nationalisation without compensation. Doba output has stagnated since nationalisation, due to a 'lack of investment'. Nationalisation without compensation has rarely succeeded, Gaddafi and Maduro both tried it... In all, it looks probable that Savannah will win significant compensation in arbitration. And this does not appear to be priced in at 8p/share.",

The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources. This proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident of announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the next 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space\u201d. This acquisition is in addition to the Klinchenberg Transaction that is targeted to complete in Q1 2026. The statement that the \"proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah\" appears to me to be a message to the market that a suspension from a reverse takeover is unlikely in the foreseeable future, perhaps to alleviate PI jitters in this respect.",

They don't really need to fund that now to try and grow it as SAVE could/would be the vehicle imo. They only have a 10.83% interest in a small Nigerian 5.1 km2 field shared with 5 other participants that i can see. By having a 26.5% interest in SAVE they have an indirect interest to the estimated 4k bopd Stubb Creek oil field. There's currently 50 oil & gas blocks for auction only available this time to 'technically competent and financially strong firms'. https://punchng.com/nuprc-opens-50-oil-blocks-for-bidding-bars-weak-firms/ Remains to be seen if SAVE go for anything but clearly state they expect more hydrocarbon acquisitions. With SAVE having $200m ($50m being used for renewables) of available funding for asset acquisitions, surely that's an effective leverage for NIPCO to grow rather than take on pro-rata $50m+ of debt funding on their own books or from their own group cash resources to have that level of asset exposure and at the same time have an experienced operator. Even though Niger/Agadem oil has been an absolute disappointment so far for investors here, it's effectively giving NIPCO an indirect stake there of 26.5%. It's an enormous prize still to be unlocked (if ever it will be). 100% discovery rate, 33 mmbo 2C and still offers hundreds of mmmbl reserve potential. Question is if this fits with NIPCOs vision but certainly a free ride into this. Can NIPCOs involvement unlock something ? Just my opinion but perhaps SAVEs renewables/Power projects and pipeline imo sits with the Kansagra family interests of expansion across Africa as in Nigeria and other sectors. If the receivables are addressed ($200m out of $500m. Can it be resolved in its entirety over next 24 months ? ) and the Chad/Cameroon assets give a successful award ($300m out of $1.4b). It would contribute significantly to the turnaround of the company. Nipcos 26.41% stake (7p) has cost them \u00a339.2m ($52m+).  AKs reinvestment now around \u00a318m and total holding of \u00a320.5m. Pound/Dollar now \u00a31/$1.37. Dollar/Naira $1/N1390.",

With Doba nationalised and Niger oil in the ground for the foreseeable future, subject to the whims of the Niger junta and CNPC, the best one can hope for is that Chad make a payout to avoid their Vision 2030 plan to attract investors look absurd. CNPC seem to be in trouble in Niger for not using enough local labour so perhaps there is an angle there for SAVE to exploit. But the bigger issue is 'what is the point of SAVE as a company ?' Is it renewables? There are focused funds for that, tied in with development agencies - I don't see Savannah's edge. Is it the 'generational' opportunities as the majors pull out of onshore? The locals seem to have the edge there, pretty dire results to date from AK.  Feels like an unwieldy conglomerate that has lost its sense or purpose as well as its auditors - if the vision was as an ethically secure way for funds to invest in African energy the audit problems certainly will not help. I assume NIPCO see their investment as securing their source of gas, having already built a retail operation - which does make sense. It would probably make even more sense for them to consolidate their control over Accugas and the other Nigerian assets, and dump the rest of the scattershot portfolio.",

Accugas also supplies gas to several National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) stations, many of which are government\u2011owned or managed through NDPHC (e.g. Ibom Power, though partially private). Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), a government corporation, acts as intermediary/guarantor for payments to GenCos, and thus indirectly to gas suppliers like Accugas when GenCos can't pay. So there is a strong tie-in between the govt.and Accugas. Calabar is it's biggest customer so hopefully payments to Calabar will filter through to Savannah. Gas suppliers (Accugas) are mentioned specifically in the Power Gen bond prospectus but I've not seen any direct reference to them so far regarding payments. Hopefully we'll get some sort of an update soon from Save clarifying things.",

          "content": "Https://guardian.ng/featured/fg-issues-n501b-inaugural-power-sector-bond-to-clear-gencos-debts/ Federal Government of Nigeria has issued a N501 billion inaugural bond under the Presidential Power Sector Debt Reduction Programme (PPSDRP), recording 100 per cent subscription from pension funds, banks, asset managers, and other investors, marking a significant step towards resolving legacy debts, restoring liquidity, and strengthening confidence in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The programme, championed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is designed to address long-standing payment arrears owed to power generation companies, which for over a decade constrained liquidity, weakened balance sheets, and discouraged investment across the power sector value chain. The signing follows the successful completion of Series 1 Power Sector Bond Issuance by NBET Finance Company Plc. The Series 1 issuance closed at N501 billion, comprising N300 billion raised from the capital markets and N201 billion in bonds allotted to participating power generation companies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the reform agenda. Under the programme, verified receivables for electricity supplied between February 2015 and March 2025 are being settled through negotiated agreements with power generation companies. To date, five power generation companies representing fourteen power plants nationwide \u2013 First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), Geregu Power Plc, Ibom Power Company Limited, Mabon Limited, and Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) \u2013 have executed Settlement Agreements with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET).The total negotiated settlement amount for these companies stands at N827.16 billion, to be paid in four phased instalments. Proceeds from the Series 1 issuance will fund the first and second instalment payments to participating power generation companies with signed Settlement Agreements, estimated at N421.42 billion, representing approximately 50 per cent of the total negotiated settlement amount. Payments for this initial phase will be made through a mix of cash and notes. Speaking at the bond issuance signing ceremony in Lagos on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Arowolo Verheijen, stated that the programme represents a decisive reset of the electricity market, combining debt resolution with broader financial and structural reforms. Verheijen commended the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, as well as the support of the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, in making the PPSDRP a reality......",

Obvious value to Nipco of the up/mid stream Nigeria assets - instead of not getting paid for the gas it could be fed into their downstream assets, and sold for a handsome price. 2. Sale of the Niger assets to Chinese interests, they control the Benin pipeline and might be in a position to open up a second route through Chad/Cameroon 3. Sale of arbitration claims to a fund that knows the business - Elliot, Aurelius, Burford, Parabellum 4. Sale of renewable portfolio to a focused fund - AREF, ARCH, Evolution II Surely that would bring in significantly more than the current market cap?",

          "content": "... Seplat Energy\u2019s (NGX: SEPLAT, LSE: SEPL) shares rose 6.2% on the NGX in the first trading week of 2026, reaching a 52-week high of NGN6,171 ($4.33), after Heirs Energies acquired a significant minority stake in the Nigerian oil and gas producer. Seplat is a Nigerian independent oil and gas company focused on the development and production of hydrocarbons in the Niger Delta. The rally followed Heirs Energies\u2019 acquisition of a 20.07% stake previously held by Maurel & Prom S.A., a transaction valued at about $500mn. The deal involved 120.4mn shares priced at \u00a33.05 ($4.09) each and was completed in late 2025. Investors viewed the purchase as a long-term endorsement of Seplat Energy\u2019s assets and growth strategy. Seplat Energy reported strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2025. Revenue rose 213% year on year to NGN3.36 trillion ($2.35bn), exceeding the company\u2019s combined revenue from 2020 to 2024. Operating profit before tax increased to NGN879bn ($616mn) from NGN367bn ($257mn) a year earlier. Net profit, however, declined to NGN147bn ($103mn) following a tax charge of NGN732bn ($513mn). Despite the higher tax burden, shareholder returns improved. Earnings per share rose 144% to NGN240.18. Dividends declared by the third quarter of 2025 amounted to 167 cents per share, or NGN157bn ($110mn), maintaining Seplat\u2019s position as one of the Nigerian Exchange\u2019s regular dividend-paying energy companies. Operational performance was driven by a 231% increase in crude oil sales to NGN3.1 trillion ($2.17bn). Output growth followed the integration of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited\u2019s offshore assets, which added more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well restoration activities contributed an additional 33,400 barrels per day. Although oil prices fell 13% during the period, total lifted volumes increased 270% to 27.9mn barrels. Gas revenue rose to NGN215bn ($151mn), supported by liquefied petroleum gas exports and condensate sales valued at NGN51bn ($36mn). Seplat Energy has set a target to double production to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, supported by planned capital expenditure of $2.5bn-$3bn. The company has said it expects to generate $5bn-$6bn in free cash flow and distribute up to $1bn in dividends over the period.",

          "content": "9-1-2026 Energy services solutions provider Levene Energy has acquired an equity stake in natural gas company Axxela Limited, marking its entry into Nigeria\u2019s midstream and downstream gas sectors. The acquisition was completed through the BlueCore Gas InfraCo consortium \u2013 comprising Levene Energy, Afrigaz Energie, Energy& LLP and emPERSAND \u2013 and marks a key step in Levene Energy\u2019s transition from oil and refined products into a fully integrated and infrastructure-backed clean energy company. Through the transaction, the BlueCore consortium has acquired 100% of Axxela, purchasing the interests of Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation in a deal valued at approximately $285 million. The acquisition was supported by a structural debt and equity financing package arranged by Standard Bank. The acquisition aligns with BlueCore\u2019s strategy to scale gas and power infrastructure across West Africa, while positioning Levene Energy to participate in long-term energy transition assets supporting industrial demand and regional energy security. https://energycapitalpower.com/levene-energy-enters-nigerias-gas-market-with-axxela-equity-deal/ 9-1-2026 BlueCore acquires Axxela, signals confidence in Nigeria\u2019s gas infrastructure BlueCore Gas InfraCo Limited has completed the acquisition of Axxela Limited, a leading gas and power infrastructure company, from international owners Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation. The transaction highlighted the growing bankability of Nigeria\u2019s midstream gas assets, which are critical for power generation, industrial activity, and national energy security. Market participants view gas as a key transition fuel, enabling reliable power, reducing diesel use, and cutting gas flaring. \u201cThis transaction reflects a broader shift in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure investment landscape, where well-run operating assets are increasingly able to attract domestic long-term institutional capital,\u201d said Dolu Olugbenjo of Stanbic IBTC Asset Management. https://businessday.ng/energy/article/bluecore-acquires-axxela-signals-confidence-in-nigerias-gas-infrastructure/ For reference SAVE supply gas to an Axxela subsiduary.",

A few snippets - read the article for full details https://businessday.ng/energy/power/article/power-firms-turning-page-on-debt-as-fg-clears-arrears-sahara/ Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group, has said Nigeria\u2019s power sector is entering a more stable and investable phase, driven by Federal Government reforms and the gradual resolution of legacy debts that have long constrained growth across the electricity value chain. Adesina, during an interview, pointed out that recent infrastructure and macroeconomic policies under President Bola Tinubu had introduced a level of clarity and predictability that is reshaping investment decisions in the sector. He noted that the Administration\u2019s approach had helped address structural bottlenecks that previously undermined investor confidence. Besides, Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had already settled $438 million, about 73% of its original $600 million loan obligation, despite long standing liquidity challenges in the industry. According to him, the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing legacy debt settlement programme is critical to easing pressure on power companies, gas suppliers and lenders, while creating room for new capital inflows. He explained that improved policy coordination, relative exchange rate stability, easing inflationary pressures and moderated interest rates are allowing power sector operators to plan with greater conviction. Adesina added that the developments, combined with closer collaboration among government agencies, regulators, financiers and industry players, are laying the foundation for sustained growth and operational stability in Nigeria\u2019s electricity market. Sahara Power is Nigeria\u2019s foremost power company, responsible for about 19 per cent of total power generated in the nation. Its subsidiaries include Egbin Power Plc, the largest thermal power plant in sub Saharan Africa, First Independent Power Limited, a leading generating company in the Niger Delta, and Ikeja Electric, the largest privately run distribution company in sub-Saharan Africa. Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had undertaken extensive scenario planning and aligned its strategic objectives with what he described as the president\u2019s bold, clear-sighted and long-term oriented infrastructure plan. According to him, the administration has shown uncommon resolve in tackling structural bottlenecks that have historically constrained investment, particularly in the energy value chain.",

In Petronas accounts they were 'held for sale'. SHT pre-empted, as was their right, implying they paid the same as the Savannah offer. Perenco were apparently involved in financing the purchase. The sale was completed with a ceremony in Kuala Lumpar, and Petronas accounts stated 'no material effect' upon disposal, implying price received was similar to carrying value. This sets a precedent and a price on the Exxon/Savannah assets, and Savannah state that Chad admit that compensation is owed. Meanwhile the oil minister has changed since the nationalisation. Ndolenodji Alixe Naimbaye has no history of supporting nationalisation, and is currently trying to attract investment, for example SEMICA 2026 in January,  EGYPES in March. The World Bank is involved in financing several energy projects in Chad, eg Scatec $100m, PAAET $295m. The US is the largest shareholder in the World Bank, and we now know how Trump feels about nationalisation without compensation. Doba output has stagnated since nationalisation, due to a 'lack of investment'. Nationalisation without compensation has rarely succeeded, Gaddafi and Maduro both tried it... In all, it looks probable that Savannah will win significant compensation in arbitration. And this does not appear to be priced in at 8p/share.",

          "content": "It's unfortunate that a second renewables proposed acquisition with \"a strong payment history\" is hidden within the update. \"Future M&A Activity The Company continues to view mergers and acquisitions activity as a core driver of potential future value creation and is actively pursuing opportunities across both the hydrocarbon and renewable energy sectors. Savannah is in an exclusivity period in respect of the proposed acquisition of majority interests in a portfolio of renewable projects located in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an aggregate gross capacity in excess of 100 MW and a strong payment history. The proposed acquisition would also include a portfolio of renewable development projects in the same country with a targeted gross capacity of approximately 40 MW. The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources. This proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident of announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the next 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space\u201d. This acquisition is in addition to the Klinchenberg Transaction that is targeted to complete in Q1 2026. The statement that the \"proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah\" appears to me to be a message to the market that a suspension from a reverse takeover is unlikely in the foreseeable future, perhaps to alleviate PI jitters in this respect.",

Interestingly, no forecasts provided beyond 2025. Even if share price got half way to Cavendish's target, I would be elated. For transparency, SAVE is one of my \"shares for 2026\" and every time the CEO has bought, so have I . Consequently, I have quite a decent exposure.",

The Company may undertake further share buybacks opportunistically pursuant to the buyback authority granted by shareholders at the general meeting held on 28 November 2025, subject to the Company being in an open period and not being in possession of inside information and having regard to corporate liquidity and prevailing market conditions.\nUnder the Buyback Programme, the Company has repurchased a total of 32,063,641 ordinary shares in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") (the \"Buyback Shares\") at 6.8 pence per share for a total consideration of approximately \u00a32.18 million. The Company confirms that all of the Buyback Shares will be cancelled imminently.\nThe Buyback Programme was conducted in accordance with the authority granted to the Company by its shareholders at the general meeting held on 28 November 2025, which permits the purchase by the Company of up to\u00a0318,098,135 of its Ordinary Shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing completion of the Buyback Programme and the repurchase and cancellation of the Buyback Shares, the Company's issued share capital will consists of 2,088,590,594 Ordinary Shares (the \"Adjusted Share Capital\"). The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury and accordingly this will be the total number of voting rights and may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nNIPCO Plc Shareholding\nThe Company notes that, as at 5\u00a0February 2026, NIPCO Plc (\"NIPCO\"), the Company's largest shareholder, is now interested in 631,479,202 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 30.23% of the Company's voting share capital based on the Adjusted Share Capital, including through Purebond Limited's holding of 1.7 million shares in the Company. The 30% threshold was crossed as a result of the Buyback Programme (rather than through NIPCO acquiring further interests in shares) and, accordingly, in accordance with Note 1 on Rule 37.1 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Takeover Code\"). NIPCO is not required either now, or on completion of Unsettled Purchases (as defined below), to make a mandatory offer for the Company.\nThe current aggregate registered ownership of Ordinary Shares of NIPCO and Purebond represents approximately 27.93% of the Company's voting share capital based on the Adjusted Share Capital. The Company further notes that when NIPCO receives the approximately 48.15 million Ordinary Shares which have not yet settled pursuant to the acquisition of Ordinary Shares by NIPCO announced on 30 December 2025) (the \"Unsettled Purchases\"), the aggregate ownership of Ordinary Shares of NIPCO and Purebond will, following such settlement be approximately 30.23%.\nHowever, as NIPCO is now interested in more than 30%, but less than 50%, of the voting share capital of the Company based on the Adjusted Share Capital, NIPCO (and any of its concert parties) may not acquire a further interest in shares with voting rights in the Company without incurring an obligation under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code to make a mandatory offer.\nFor further information, please refer to the Company's website www.savannah-energy.com or contact:\nSavannah Energy\n+44 (0) 20 3817 9844\nAndrew Knott, CEO\nNick Beattie, CFO\nSally Marshak, Head of IR & Communications\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Spinney\nRitchie Balmer\nRob Patrick\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nDerrick Lee\nTim Redfern\nTennyson Securities (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 4530 9239\nPeter Krens\nCamarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4983\nBilly Clegg\nOwen Roberts\nViolet Wilson\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nAbout Savannah:\nSavannah Energy PLC is a British independent energy company focused around the delivery of\nProjects that Matter\nin\nAfrica.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

All figures are unaudited.\nAndrew Knott, CEO of Savannah, said:\n\"2025 was a year of execution for Savannah with good progress delivered across the nine focus areas we set out at the start of the year. In Nigeria, we\nincreased our rate of cash collections year-on-year by 12%, a trend which we hope to continue into 2026, and have made significant progress in refinancing our debt faci\nlities.\nIn our Hydrocarbons Division, the completion of the SIPEC acquisition in March enabled us to commence an expansion programme at Stubb Creek, increasing 2025 production materially above 2024 levels. At Uquo we delivered the new compression system under budget and advanced site construction ahead of the planned commencement of drilling of the new Uquo NE well. During the year, we also announced a 21% 2P Reserves upgrade at the Uquo gas field and a 29% upgrade to Stubb Creek oil field 2P Reserves. In Niger, we remain actively engaged with the Government on future activity, with the R3 East development plan significantly enhanced during the year.\nIn the power sector, we repositioned our business model and advanced both operating and development opportunities, including the proposed acquisition of interests in three East African hydropower projects, which is targeted for completion in H1 this year. We have also continued to progress on our wind, solar and hydro portfolio. Alongside this, we continue to pursue further value-accretive acquisitions across both hydrocarbons and power, with several other opportunities under active discussion.\nWe also continued to progress our arbitration claims, with the Savannah Chad Inc (\"SCI\") and Savannah Midstream Investment Limited (\"SMIL\") proceedings currently expected to be concluded in the first half of 2026.\nOverall, this progress provides a strong platform for continued delivery in 2026.\n\"\nHighlights\nOperational\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 average gross daily production of 18.8 Kboepd (FY 2024: 23.1 Kboepd), of which 83% was gas (FY 2024: 88%)1.\nFollowing completion of the SIPEC Acquisition in March 2025, commenced an 18-month expansion programme that saw Stubb Creek average gross daily production increase to 3.0 Kbopd in 2025, approximately 13% above the 2024 average;\n\u00b7\nWell site construction for the Uquo NE development well is expected to be completed this month.\nThe rig is ready for deployment, with mobilisation scheduled over the next few weeks\nand first gas targeted by the end of Q2 2026;\n\u00b7\nWell site preparation has commenced on the Uquo South exploration well;\n\u00b7\nNew compression system at the Uquo Central Processing Facility (\"CPF\") completed and fully commissioned. This project, which was delivered safely and approximately 10% under the original US$45 million budget, is expected to allow us to maximise the production from our existing and future gas wells;\n\u00b7\nGas contract extension agreed with the Central Horizon Gas Company Limited (\"CHGC\") to end December 2026 for up to 10 MMscfpd;\n\u00b7\nThe proposed acquisition of indirect interests in three East African hydropower projects is targeted to complete in H1 2026. The assets include the 255 MW Bujagali power plant, with a 13-year operating and payment track record, and two advanced-stage development projects, marking Savannah's potential for entry into five new countries - Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the \"DRC\"), Malawi and Rwanda;\n\u00b7\nContinuing to progress our existing priority Power Division projects, including the up to 250 MW Parc Eolien de la Tarka wind farm project in Niger and the up to 95 MW Bini a Warak hybrid hydroelectric and solar project in Cameroon;\n\u00b7\nSubject to a satisfactory agreement being reached with the Government of Niger\n, our subsidiary is considering commencing a four-well testing programme and/or a return to exploration activity in the R1234 PSC contract area in 2026/27; and\n\u00b7\nActively reviewing opportunities in both the thermal and renewable power sector, with the expectation of announcing\ntransaction(s) currently under consideration over the course of the next 24 months in the African power space.\nFinancial (unaudited)\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 cash collections increased by over 12% on the prior year to US$278.0 million (FY 2024: US$248.5 million) and this trend has continued into 2026 with cash collections during January 2026 of over US$64.4 million (January 2024: US$20.4 million);\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 Total Revenues2 of\nUS$235.0 million (FY 2024: US$258.9 million);\n\u00b7\nAs at 31 December 2025, cash balances were US$39.5 million (31 December 2024: US$32.6 million) and net debt stood at US$655.9 million (31 December 2024: US$636.9 million).

And that the main holders noted by Zengas are not going to start selling at this sort of price. In which case the float is under 20%, and some of that will be holders with no intention to sell under 10. I wouldn't expect the buyback program to function much above this level due to optics - they issued stock at 7p. But if they're writing a put at 6.8p, an entry around 7p can be reframed as a cheap call option on management getting receivables down, some sort of arbitration settlement  and stock price that better reflects sum-of-the-parts.",

Some might say there's a degree of assumption by you in that post  MudPump, but I didn't hesitate to tick it up, as I potentially see plenty of merit in it. And, to extend such thinking further, I'd offer that if the company became aware of a size seller coming into play in the 7 's  or  8's  or 9's... etc... they might equally see merit in using spare treasury funds - if available at that time etc - to buy out that seller at a mutually agreeable price and again cancel those shares, thus continuing to facilitate any rally that might be in train  (I note AK personally hoovering some up at 8p ish  recently ish for eg ..etc..) And extending such thinking one step further again,  if cash collections continued on a good path thru coming 2026 months - include maybe even arbitration settlement monies into save Treasury too - then the company could formally announce a decent sized share buyback scheme, in due 2026  course.... which might well further facilitate a meaningful rally here..  etc.. imho & dyor",

By restructuring these debts (backed by the government and needed industry reforms), the objective is to clean  up the balance sheets of key stakeholders, particularly GenCos and GasCos, enhance industry liquidity and promote investments in the sector. This in turn, will improve creditworthiness, enable better planning and  operations and unlock new capital for infrastructure upgrades, metering and generation expansion.",

These type of claims often carry fairly heavy compensatory interest and an interest rate of 6.5%-8% would put you in the ballpark of the interest accrued to date. The $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party is still stalled as far as I can make out and  the transaction only completes if certain pre\u2011set requirements are met, mainly around changes to COTCo\u2019s corporate rules and regional approvals, so even though the numbers are close it could well just be a  re-evaluation of the claim itself by Savannah and nothing to do with the proposed sale. Although today's update was mainly stuff we already knew, we have confirmation of the refinancing completion and a positive cash collection for January without any reference to a one-off payment via the power bond. Nipco have increased their stake which will please the conspiracy theorists, though why they aren't buying up all the stock up to 8p in readiness for a MO is beyond me ;-)",

Just a thought but possible that debtors can access some additional cash/loans from somewhere while they await the govt bond clearance. Compared to the previous financial update there was only an increase for receivables of $300k. Our debt/net debt is also affected by the interest pro-rata that is charged to us on the Exxon facility. One thing of note that in the last year or so the interest applied to the claims has gone up by $75m especially to around $1.4 billion overall. I wonder why the Cameroon section claim was changed from $380m to $330m mid last year (ish). Is that something to do with the $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party ? Any thoughts ? We must be paying some costs up front as well as these cases have been ongoing now 3 years. 4/2/26 SCI and SMIL are claiming in excess of US$775 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$215 million and costs) for the nationalisation of their rights and assets in Chad.4 SMIL has a claim valued at approximately US$330 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$67 million plus costs). 22/10/25.

          "content": "The Federal Government has moved to end the practice of carrying electricity subsidy costs alone, announcing a framework that will spread the burden across federal, state, and local governments from 2026. The Director-General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Tanimu Yakubu, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja during a training and sensitisation workshop for ministries, departments, and agencies on the 2026 post-budget preparation process using the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System Budget Preparation Sub-System. Yakubu said President Bola Tinubu had directed that electricity subsidy costs be made explicit, tracked, and fairly shared across tiers of government, warning that the current approach creates hidden liabilities and recurring crises in the power market. \u201cIf we want a stable power sector, we must pay for the choices we make,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen tariffs are held below cost, a gap is created. That gap is a subsidy. And a subsidy is a bill.\u201d He added that from 2026, the Federal Government would no longer treat electricity subsidies as an open-ended obligation borne solely by the centre, especially where policy decisions and political benefits are shared. \u201cIn 2026, we will stop pretending that this bill can be left to the Federal Government alone, especially where the policy choice or the political benefit is shared across tiers of government,\u201d Yakubu said. According to him, the President has instructed that the existing electricity sector legal framework be invoked to ensure that subsidy sharing is practical, transparent, and enforceable. \u201cThis means subsidy costs must be explicit, tracked, and funded, so they do not return as arrears, liquidity crises, or hidden liabilities in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any tier of government chooses affordability interventions, the funding responsibilities must be clear, agreed, and enforceable.\u201d Yakubu stressed that the policy was not designed as a sanction but as a mechanism to align incentives across government and support efficiency in the power sector. \u201cThis is not punishment. It is alignment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen everyone carries a fair share of the cost, everyone also has an incentive to support cost-reflective efficiency, targeted protection for the vulnerable, and a power market that can actually deliver.\u201d He told MDAs to reflect subsidy-related costs clearly in their 2026 budget submissions and avoid pushing unfunded liabilities into the electricity market. Beyond power subsidies, Yakubu said the 2026 Budget marked a clear break from rollover budgeting and fragmented project lists, which he said had weakened execution and accountability over the years. \u201cThe 2026 Budget corrects this. It is built as one coherent implementation framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThe approach is to consolidate commitments into a single, visible pipeline and manage them as a disciplined programme of delivery.\u201d https://punchng.com/fg-moves-to-share-electricity-subsidy-cos",

Surely the Gencos could have more outstanding debt to agree on given they are higher up in the chain in terms of their overall invoiced sales with their costs and margins above that of the actual gas owed for. If SAVE got more of the receivables debt paid in a lump sum rather than waiting x years, it might be pragmatic who knows. They could put a bigger cash lump to better  use if they had it sooner rather than longer down the road. How much of the receivables are still on the books from before SAVE bought over Accugas when the sellers then took a haircut to the SAVE restructuring/buy-out ? On top of that we saw in April 2025 SAVE take a 50% cut in the outstanding balance owed from Fenikso of $11.525m and settled it for $5.7625m fully paid by Dec 2025. (Out of the $16.2m owed to Save on the original $1m investment, SAVE received a total of $10.4m paid and would have been waiting about another 4-5 years to receive it all). Perhaps there will or could be a reduction in the future make-up gas to supply ? From memory, i thought i recall at one investor Q&A in the past that they thought they might be able to offset something or do a deal with the government re a field/asset acquisition ?",

The key paragraph for me is: Ikon (Proton Energy CEO) told CNBC africa that the successful transaction marked a turning point for the industry by restoring cashflow and encouraging new investment.  He said generation companies had agreed to a 40% haircut on outstanding receivables in exchange for certainty of payment and improved market conditions. Now its hard to verify that 40%, but if that indeed is the case and the various gencos have accepted it, it might not necessarily be a bad thing.  If this means that SAVE has signed a similar agreement, does this mean we get certainty that we get $300m (60% of $500m) of our receivables paid sooner rather than later.  Does this improve the gas/electricity market over the medium to long term in Nigeria?",

          "content": "In addition to the government auctioning a mix of 50 on and offshore blocks, NNPC launched a process to sell stakes of a minimum 25% in oil/gas assets. ' Nigeria\u2019s state oil company NNPC said on Dec. 29 it plans to sell stakes in selected oil and gas assets, launching a formal bidding process. Some of the assets are held directly by NNPC, while others are operated in partnership with international oil companies including Shell, Chevron, Eni and TotalEnergies. The company did not disclose the expected value of the sale or the size of the stakes on offer. Under the timetable released by NNPC, interested bidders must register online by Jan. 10, 2026. Companies will be selected through a pre-qualification process based on technical and financial capacity, followed by document reviews, negotiations and the obtaining of regulatory approvals. Shortlisted bidders will then be granted access to a secure virtual data room containing detailed information on the assets. The move reflects an NNPC strategy to divest at least 25% of certain interests, either through outright sales or reductions in joint venture holdings, as part of efforts to streamline its portfolio.

It is he sort of ingenious scheme that Andrew Knott is more than capable of designing and would go a long way to explain why Nipco was allowed to invest on such favourable terms. Small shareholders were outraged at the terms butmajor shareholders supported the proposal as reflected in some 99% of the votes cast in favour. I certainly hope that your interpretation is correct as it would once more let us think about th share in terms of \u00a3s rather than pence. Kinkell",

With Doba nationalised and Niger oil in the ground for the foreseeable future, subject to the whims of the Niger junta and CNPC, the best one can hope for is that Chad make a payout to avoid their Vision 2030 plan to attract investors look absurd. CNPC seem to be in trouble in Niger for not using enough local labour so perhaps there is an angle there for SAVE to exploit. But the bigger issue is 'what is the point of SAVE as a company ?' Is it renewables? There are focused funds for that, tied in with development agencies - I don't see Savannah's edge. Is it the 'generational' opportunities as the majors pull out of onshore? The locals seem to have the edge there, pretty dire results to date from AK.  Feels like an unwieldy conglomerate that has lost its sense or purpose as well as its auditors - if the vision was as an ethically secure way for funds to invest in African energy the audit problems certainly will not help. I assume NIPCO see their investment as securing their source of gas, having already built a retail operation - which does make sense. It would probably make even more sense for them to consolidate their control over Accugas and the other Nigerian assets, and dump the rest of the scattershot portfolio.",

Accugas also supplies gas to several National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) stations, many of which are government\u2011owned or managed through NDPHC (e.g. Ibom Power, though partially private). Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), a government corporation, acts as intermediary/guarantor for payments to GenCos, and thus indirectly to gas suppliers like Accugas when GenCos can't pay. So there is a strong tie-in between the govt.and Accugas. Calabar is it's biggest customer so hopefully payments to Calabar will filter through to Savannah. Gas suppliers (Accugas) are mentioned specifically in the Power Gen bond prospectus but I've not seen any direct reference to them so far regarding payments.

The programme, championed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is designed to address long-standing payment arrears owed to power generation companies, which for over a decade constrained liquidity, weakened balance sheets, and discouraged investment across the power sector value chain. The signing follows the successful completion of Series 1 Power Sector Bond Issuance by NBET Finance Company Plc. The Series 1 issuance closed at N501 billion, comprising N300 billion raised from the capital markets and N201 billion in bonds allotted to participating power generation companies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the reform agenda. Under the programme, verified receivables for electricity supplied between February 2015 and March 2025 are being settled through negotiated agreements with power generation companies. To date, five power generation companies representing fourteen power plants nationwide \u2013 First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), Geregu Power Plc, Ibom Power Company Limited, Mabon Limited, and Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) \u2013 have executed Settlement Agreements with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET).The total negotiated settlement amount for these companies stands at N827.16 billion, to be paid in four phased instalments. Proceeds from the Series 1 issuance will fund the first and second instalment payments to participating power generation companies with signed Settlement Agreements, estimated at N421.42 billion, representing approximately 50 per cent of the total negotiated settlement amount. Payments for this initial phase will be made through a mix of cash and notes. Speaking at the bond issuance signing ceremony in Lagos on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Arowolo Verheijen, stated that the programme represents a decisive reset of the electricity market, combining debt resolution with broader financial and structural reforms. Verheijen commended the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, as well as the support of the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, in making the PPSDRP a reality......",

Obvious value to Nipco of the up/mid stream Nigeria assets - instead of not getting paid for the gas it could be fed into their downstream assets, and sold for a handsome price. 2. Sale of the Niger assets to Chinese interests, they control the Benin pipeline and might be in a position to open up a second route through Chad/Cameroon 3. Sale of arbitration claims to a fund that knows the business - Elliot, Aurelius, Burford, Parabellum 4. Sale of renewable portfolio to a focused fund - AREF, ARCH, Evolution II Surely that would bring in significantly more than the current market cap?",

          "content": "... Seplat Energy\u2019s (NGX: SEPLAT, LSE: SEPL) shares rose 6.2% on the NGX in the first trading week of 2026, reaching a 52-week high of NGN6,171 ($4.33), after Heirs Energies acquired a significant minority stake in the Nigerian oil and gas producer. Seplat is a Nigerian independent oil and gas company focused on the development and production of hydrocarbons in the Niger Delta. The rally followed Heirs Energies\u2019 acquisition of a 20.07% stake previously held by Maurel & Prom S.A., a transaction valued at about $500mn. The deal involved 120.4mn shares priced at \u00a33.05 ($4.09) each and was completed in late 2025. Investors viewed the purchase as a long-term endorsement of Seplat Energy\u2019s assets and growth strategy. Seplat Energy reported strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2025. Revenue rose 213% year on year to NGN3.36 trillion ($2.35bn), exceeding the company\u2019s combined revenue from 2020 to 2024. Operating profit before tax increased to NGN879bn ($616mn) from NGN367bn ($257mn) a year earlier. Net profit, however, declined to NGN147bn ($103mn) following a tax charge of NGN732bn ($513mn). Despite the higher tax burden, shareholder returns improved. Earnings per share rose 144% to NGN240.18. Dividends declared by the third quarter of 2025 amounted to 167 cents per share, or NGN157bn ($110mn), maintaining Seplat\u2019s position as one of the Nigerian Exchange\u2019s regular dividend-paying energy companies. Operational performance was driven by a 231% increase in crude oil sales to NGN3.1 trillion ($2.17bn). Output growth followed the integration of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited\u2019s offshore assets, which added more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well restoration activities contributed an additional 33,400 barrels per day. Although oil prices fell 13% during the period, total lifted volumes increased 270% to 27.9mn barrels. Gas revenue rose to NGN215bn ($151mn), supported by liquefied petroleum gas exports and condensate sales valued at NGN51bn ($36mn). Seplat Energy has set a target to double production to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, supported by planned capital expenditure of $2.5bn-$3bn. The company has said it expects to generate $5bn-$6bn in free cash flow and distribute up to $1bn in dividends over the period.",

          "content": "9-1-2026 Energy services solutions provider Levene Energy has acquired an equity stake in natural gas company Axxela Limited, marking its entry into Nigeria\u2019s midstream and downstream gas sectors. The acquisition was completed through the BlueCore Gas InfraCo consortium \u2013 comprising Levene Energy, Afrigaz Energie, Energy& LLP and emPERSAND \u2013 and marks a key step in Levene Energy\u2019s transition from oil and refined products into a fully integrated and infrastructure-backed clean energy company. Through the transaction, the BlueCore consortium has acquired 100% of Axxela, purchasing the interests of Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation in a deal valued at approximately $285 million. The acquisition was supported by a structural debt and equity financing package arranged by Standard Bank. The acquisition aligns with BlueCore\u2019s strategy to scale gas and power infrastructure across West Africa, while positioning Levene Energy to participate in long-term energy transition assets supporting industrial demand and regional energy security. https://energycapitalpower.com/levene-energy-enters-nigerias-gas-market-with-axxela-equity-deal/ 9-1-2026 BlueCore acquires Axxela, signals confidence in Nigeria\u2019s gas infrastructure BlueCore Gas InfraCo Limited has completed the acquisition of Axxela Limited, a leading gas and power infrastructure company, from international owners Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation. The transaction highlighted the growing bankability of Nigeria\u2019s midstream gas assets, which are critical for power generation, industrial activity, and national energy security. Market participants view gas as a key transition fuel, enabling reliable power, reducing diesel use, and cutting gas flaring. \u201cThis transaction reflects a broader shift in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure investment landscape, where well-run operating assets are increasingly able to attract domestic long-term institutional capital,\u201d said Dolu Olugbenjo of Stanbic IBTC Asset Management. https://businessday.ng/energy/article/bluecore-acquires-axxela-signals-confidence-in-nigerias-gas-infrastructure/ For reference SAVE supply gas to an Axxela subsiduary.",

A few snippets - read the article for full details https://businessday.ng/energy/power/article/power-firms-turning-page-on-debt-as-fg-clears-arrears-sahara/ Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group, has said Nigeria\u2019s power sector is entering a more stable and investable phase, driven by Federal Government reforms and the gradual resolution of legacy debts that have long constrained growth across the electricity value chain. Adesina, during an interview, pointed out that recent infrastructure and macroeconomic policies under President Bola Tinubu had introduced a level of clarity and predictability that is reshaping investment decisions in the sector. He noted that the Administration\u2019s approach had helped address structural bottlenecks that previously undermined investor confidence. Besides, Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had already settled $438 million, about 73% of its original $600 million loan obligation, despite long standing liquidity challenges in the industry. According to him, the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing legacy debt settlement programme is critical to easing pressure on power companies, gas suppliers and lenders, while creating room for new capital inflows. He explained that improved policy coordination, relative exchange rate stability, easing inflationary pressures and moderated interest rates are allowing power sector operators to plan with greater conviction. Adesina added that the developments, combined with closer collaboration among government agencies, regulators, financiers and industry players, are laying the foundation for sustained growth and operational stability in Nigeria\u2019s electricity market. Sahara Power is Nigeria\u2019s foremost power company, responsible for about 19 per cent of total power generated in the nation. Its subsidiaries include Egbin Power Plc, the largest thermal power plant in sub Saharan Africa, First Independent Power Limited, a leading generating company in the Niger Delta, and Ikeja Electric, the largest privately run distribution company in sub-Saharan Africa. Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had undertaken extensive scenario planning and aligned its strategic objectives with what he described as the president\u2019s bold, clear-sighted and long-term oriented infrastructure plan. According to him, the administration has shown uncommon resolve in tackling structural bottlenecks that have historically constrained investment, particularly in the energy value chain.",

In Petronas accounts they were 'held for sale'. SHT pre-empted, as was their right, implying they paid the same as the Savannah offer. Perenco were apparently involved in financing the purchase. The sale was completed with a ceremony in Kuala Lumpar, and Petronas accounts stated 'no material effect' upon disposal, implying price received was similar to carrying value. This sets a precedent and a price on the Exxon/Savannah assets, and Savannah state that Chad admit that compensation is owed. Meanwhile the oil minister has changed since the nationalisation. Ndolenodji Alixe Naimbaye has no history of supporting nationalisation, and is currently trying to attract investment, for example SEMICA 2026 in January,  EGYPES in March. The World Bank is involved in financing several energy projects in Chad, eg Scatec $100m, PAAET $295m. The US is the largest shareholder in the World Bank, and we now know how Trump feels about nationalisation without compensation. Doba output has stagnated since nationalisation, due to a 'lack of investment'. Nationalisation without compensation has rarely succeeded, Gaddafi and Maduro both tried it... In all, it looks probable that Savannah will win significant compensation in arbitration. And this does not appear to be priced in at 8p/share.",

          "content": "It's unfortunate that a second renewables proposed acquisition with \"a strong payment history\" is hidden within the update. \"Future M&A Activity The Company continues to view mergers and acquisitions activity as a core driver of potential future value creation and is actively pursuing opportunities across both the hydrocarbon and renewable energy sectors. Savannah is in an exclusivity period in respect of the proposed acquisition of majority interests in a portfolio of renewable projects located in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an aggregate gross capacity in excess of 100 MW and a strong payment history. The proposed acquisition would also include a portfolio of renewable development projects in the same country with a targeted gross capacity of approximately 40 MW. The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources. This proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident of announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the next 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space\u201d. This acquisition is in addition to the Klinchenberg Transaction that is targeted to complete in Q1 2026. The statement that the \"proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah\" appears to me to be a message to the market that a suspension from a reverse takeover is unlikely in the foreseeable future, perhaps to alleviate PI jitters in this respect.",

          "content": "Part of article from todays U/S .  This is the adjacent block to SAVE. 'Deep exploration prize Meanwhile, in highly promising Block H in the Termit basin, CGIP is in talks with parties about investing in an asset covered by modern 3D seismic data, the resource potential of which exceeds 1 billion barrels and where a multi-well drilling campaign has been lined up.  Legacy operators on this block \u2014 including Conoco and Exxon \u2014 drilled 16 wells and made 11 oil discoveries, all Tertiary in age. One find, the SHT-operated Sedigui, has been carved out of the PSC and at one time supplied up to 3000 bpd of oil to a refinery north of Ndjamena via a 10,000 bpd pipeline. Levy said no oil currently flows in this pipeline, which will need to be rehabilitated to achieve its full capacity, so CGIP has had talks about potentially using it to tie in some early production from Block H. CGIP's initial focus is to drill delineation wells on existing discoveries that would also target deeper Cretaceous objectives not tackled by Delonex because in-country rigs could not reach these depths. Prime drilling objective The initial plan, said Levy, is to appraise the 40 million to 50 million-barrel Kanem discovery and then drill deeper into a Cretaceous formation that could hold a major prize, some 500 million barrels of oil. Levy stressed the exploration targets are \u201cgeologically independent\u201d so success or failure at one \u201cdoesn't say anything about the other prospects\u201d, while adding that drilling in the Termit basin in Niger has also been successful. Overall, CGIP aims to undertake a six-well campaign in Block H and is in talks with rig owners to bring a suitable unit into Chad. Each well is expected to cost US$8 million to US$15 million, depending on the depths drilled, with tests carried out on the Tertiary discoveries as a matter of course. To fund this campaign, he said the company may bring in a partner. Partner discussions Discussions are under way with \u201ca couple of groups about a potential farm-in\u201d, with Lake adding that it is \u201csurprising companies, let's put it that way\u201d. Block H's contingent resources stand 90 million barrels but what is enthusing CGIP is its 1.2 billion barrels of prospective recoverable resources. Lake said: \u201cWe think a four-well programme could deliver about 450 million barrels of oil on a recoverable success basis,\u201d highlighting that such a volume could justify building an export pipeline with capacity of 110,000 bpd. However, initially CGIP aims to produce about 10,000 bpd at an all-in cost of US$75 million.Security deal Asked about security in Block H given jihadist extremist group Boko Haram's activities in Niger and Nigeria, Levy said they have never targeted oil and gas infrastructure but \u201cit's something you need to be properly prepared for\u201d. CGIP is working with a dedicated military division \u2014 DSPIP \u2014 established by Chad's government to specifically protect oil and gas assets.'",

By restructuring these debts (backed by the government and needed industry reforms), the objective is to clean  up the balance sheets of key stakeholders, particularly GenCos and GasCos, enhance industry liquidity and promote investments in the sector. This in turn, will improve creditworthiness, enable better planning and  operations and unlock new capital for infrastructure upgrades, metering and generation expansion.",

These type of claims often carry fairly heavy compensatory interest and an interest rate of 6.5%-8% would put you in the ballpark of the interest accrued to date. The $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party is still stalled as far as I can make out and  the transaction only completes if certain pre\u2011set requirements are met, mainly around changes to COTCo\u2019s corporate rules and regional approvals, so even though the numbers are close it could well just be a  re-evaluation of the claim itself by Savannah and nothing to do with the proposed sale. Although today's update was mainly stuff we already knew, we have confirmation of the refinancing completion and a positive cash collection for January without any reference to a one-off payment via the power bond. Nipco have increased their stake which will please the conspiracy theorists, though why they aren't buying up all the stock up to 8p in readiness for a MO is beyond me ;-)",

Just a thought but possible that debtors can access some additional cash/loans from somewhere while they await the govt bond clearance. Compared to the previous financial update there was only an increase for receivables of $300k. Our debt/net debt is also affected by the interest pro-rata that is charged to us on the Exxon facility. One thing of note that in the last year or so the interest applied to the claims has gone up by $75m especially to around $1.4 billion overall. I wonder why the Cameroon section claim was changed from $380m to $330m mid last year (ish). Is that something to do with the $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party ? Any thoughts ? We must be paying some costs up front as well as these cases have been ongoing now 3 years. 4/2/26 SCI and SMIL are claiming in excess of US$775 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$215 million and costs) for the nationalisation of their rights and assets in Chad.4 SMIL has a claim valued at approximately US$330 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$67 million plus costs). 22/10/25.

The Director-General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Tanimu Yakubu, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja during a training and sensitisation workshop for ministries, departments, and agencies on the 2026 post-budget preparation process using the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System Budget Preparation Sub-System. Yakubu said President Bola Tinubu had directed that electricity subsidy costs be made explicit, tracked, and fairly shared across tiers of government, warning that the current approach creates hidden liabilities and recurring crises in the power market. \u201cIf we want a stable power sector, we must pay for the choices we make,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen tariffs are held below cost, a gap is created. That gap is a subsidy. And a subsidy is a bill.\u201d He added that from 2026, the Federal Government would no longer treat electricity subsidies as an open-ended obligation borne solely by the centre, especially where policy decisions and political benefits are shared. \u201cIn 2026, we will stop pretending that this bill can be left to the Federal Government alone, especially where the policy choice or the political benefit is shared across tiers of government,\u201d Yakubu said. According to him, the President has instructed that the existing electricity sector legal framework be invoked to ensure that subsidy sharing is practical, transparent, and enforceable. \u201cThis means subsidy costs must be explicit, tracked, and funded, so they do not return as arrears, liquidity crises, or hidden liabilities in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any tier of government chooses affordability interventions, the funding responsibilities must be clear, agreed, and enforceable.\u201d Yakubu stressed that the policy was not designed as a sanction but as a mechanism to align incentives across government and support efficiency in the power sector. \u201cThis is not punishment. It is alignment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen everyone carries a fair share of the cost, everyone also has an incentive to support cost-reflective efficiency, targeted protection for the vulnerable, and a power market that can actually deliver.\u201d He told MDAs to reflect subsidy-related costs clearly in their 2026 budget submissions and avoid pushing unfunded liabilities into the electricity market. Beyond power subsidies, Yakubu said the 2026 Budget marked a clear break from rollover budgeting and fragmented project lists, which he said had weakened execution and accountability over the years. \u201cThe 2026 Budget corrects this. It is built as one coherent implementation framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThe approach is to consolidate commitments into a single, visible pipeline and manage them as a disciplined programme of delivery.\u201d https://punchng.com/fg-moves-to-share-electricity-subsidy-cos",

Surely the Gencos could have more outstanding debt to agree on given they are higher up in the chain in terms of their overall invoiced sales with their costs and margins above that of the actual gas owed for. If SAVE got more of the receivables debt paid in a lump sum rather than waiting x years, it might be pragmatic who knows. They could put a bigger cash lump to better  use if they had it sooner rather than longer down the road. How much of the receivables are still on the books from before SAVE bought over Accugas when the sellers then took a haircut to the SAVE restructuring/buy-out ? On top of that we saw in April 2025 SAVE take a 50% cut in the outstanding balance owed from Fenikso of $11.525m and settled it for $5.7625m fully paid by Dec 2025. (Out of the $16.2m owed to Save on the original $1m investment, SAVE received a total of $10.4m paid and would have been waiting about another 4-5 years to receive it all). Perhaps there will or could be a reduction in the future make-up gas to supply ? From memory, i thought i recall at one investor Q&A in the past that they thought they might be able to offset something or do a deal with the government re a field/asset acquisition ?",

In this regard, the Government successfully launched a NGN590 billion first tranche bond issuance in Q4 2025, as part of a wider NGN4 trillion bond programme to settle verified legacy invoices owed to Gencos and gas suppliers. This has created renewed positive momentum in the discussions Accugas Ltd, an 80% Savannah owned subsidiary, is having with its offtakers that are Gencos around the repayment of the Company's outstanding receivables balance in an accelerated manner.' The use of the word 'subsequently' suggests possibly that the gas suppliers may not be included in the first tranche of the bond programme, hence nothing as yet to RNS.

The key paragraph for me is: Ikon (Proton Energy CEO) told CNBC africa that the successful transaction marked a turning point for the industry by restoring cashflow and encouraging new investment.  He said generation companies had agreed to a 40% haircut on outstanding receivables in exchange for certainty of payment and improved market conditions. Now its hard to verify that 40%, but if that indeed is the case and the various gencos have accepted it, it might not necessarily be a bad thing.  If this means that SAVE has signed a similar agreement, does this mean we get certainty that we get $300m (60% of $500m) of our receivables paid sooner rather than later.  Does this improve the gas/electricity market over the medium to long term in Nigeria?",

They don't really need to fund that now to try and grow it as SAVE could/would be the vehicle imo. They only have a 10.83% interest in a small Nigerian 5.1 km2 field shared with 5 other participants that i can see. By having a 26.5% interest in SAVE they have an indirect interest to the estimated 4k bopd Stubb Creek oil field. There's currently 50 oil & gas blocks for auction only available this time to 'technically competent and financially strong firms'. https://punchng.com/nuprc-opens-50-oil-blocks-for-bidding-bars-weak-firms/ Remains to be seen if SAVE go for anything but clearly state they expect more hydrocarbon acquisitions. With SAVE having $200m ($50m being used for renewables) of available funding for asset acquisitions, surely that's an effective leverage for NIPCO to grow rather than take on pro-rata $50m+ of debt funding on their own books or from their own group cash resources to have that level of asset exposure and at the same time have an experienced operator. Even though Niger/Agadem oil has been an absolute disappointment so far for investors here, it's effectively giving NIPCO an indirect stake there of 26.5%. It's an enormous prize still to be unlocked (if ever it will be). 100% discovery rate, 33 mmbo 2C and still offers hundreds of mmmbl reserve potential. Question is if this fits with NIPCOs vision but certainly a free ride into this. Can NIPCOs involvement unlock something ? Just my opinion but perhaps SAVEs renewables/Power projects and pipeline imo sits with the Kansagra family interests of expansion across Africa as in Nigeria and other sectors. If the receivables are addressed ($200m out of $500m. Can it be resolved in its entirety over next 24 months ? ) and the Chad/Cameroon assets give a successful award ($300m out of $1.4b). It would contribute significantly to the turnaround of the company. Nipcos 26.41% stake (7p) has cost them \u00a339.2m ($52m+).  AKs reinvestment now around \u00a318m and total holding of \u00a320.5m. Pound/Dollar now \u00a31/$1.37. Dollar/Naira $1/N1390.",

          "content": "I think NIPCOs involvement is more than just about the gas. NIPCO PLC set up Nipco E&P ltd to acquire Upstream oil and gas interests. They don't really need to fund that now to try and grow it as SAVE could/would be the vehicle imo. They only have a 10.83% interest in a small Nigerian 5.1 km2 field shared with 5 other participants that i can see. By having a 26.5% interest in SAVE they have an indirect interest to the estimated 4k bopd Stubb Creek oil field. There's currently 50 oil & gas blocks for auction only available this time to 'technically competent and financially strong firms'. https://punchng.com/nuprc-opens-50-oil-blocks-for-bidding-bars-weak-firms/ Remains to be seen if SAVE go for anything but clearly state they expect more hydrocarbon acquisitions. With SAVE having $200m ($50m being used for renewables) of available funding for asset acquisitions, surely that's an effective leverage for NIPCO to grow rather than take on pro-rata $50m+ of debt funding on their own books or from their own group cash resources to have that level of asset exposure and at the same time have an experienced operator. Even though Niger/Agadem oil has been an absolute disappointment so far for investors here, it's effectively giving NIPCO an indirect stake there of 26.5%. It's an enormous prize still to be unlocked (if ever it will be). 100% discovery rate, 33 mmbo 2C and still offers hundreds of mmmbl reserve potential. Question is if this fits with NIPCOs vision but certainly a free ride into this. Can NIPCOs involvement unlock something ? Just my opinion but perhaps SAVEs renewables/Power projects and pipeline imo sits with the Kansagra family interests of expansion across Africa as in Nigeria and other sectors. If the receivables are addressed ($200m out of $500m. Can it be resolved in its entirety over next 24 months ? ) and the Chad/Cameroon assets give a successful award ($300m out of $1.4b). It would contribute significantly to the turnaround of the company. Nipcos 26.41% stake (7p) has cost them \u00a339.2m ($52m+).  AKs reinvestment now around \u00a318m and total holding of \u00a320.5m. Pound/Dollar now \u00a31/$1.37. Dollar/Naira $1/N1390.",

With Doba nationalised and Niger oil in the ground for the foreseeable future, subject to the whims of the Niger junta and CNPC, the best one can hope for is that Chad make a payout to avoid their Vision 2030 plan to attract investors look absurd. CNPC seem to be in trouble in Niger for not using enough local labour so perhaps there is an angle there for SAVE to exploit. But the bigger issue is 'what is the point of SAVE as a company ?' Is it renewables? There are focused funds for that, tied in with development agencies - I don't see Savannah's edge. Is it the 'generational' opportunities as the majors pull out of onshore? The locals seem to have the edge there, pretty dire results to date from AK.  Feels like an unwieldy conglomerate that has lost its sense or purpose as well as its auditors - if the vision was as an ethically secure way for funds to invest in African energy the audit problems certainly will not help. I assume NIPCO see their investment as securing their source of gas, having already built a retail operation - which does make sense. It would probably make even more sense for them to consolidate their control over Accugas and the other Nigerian assets, and dump the rest of the scattershot portfolio.",

Calabar Generation Company (Calabar GenCo): A major Accugas customer, owned by Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), a government entity under the Federal Ministry of Power. Accugas also supplies gas to several National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) stations, many of which are government\u2011owned or managed through NDPHC (e.g. Ibom Power, though partially private). Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), a government corporation, acts as intermediary/guarantor for payments to GenCos, and thus indirectly to gas suppliers like Accugas when GenCos can't pay. So there is a strong tie-in between the govt.and Accugas. Calabar is it's biggest customer so hopefully payments to Calabar will filter through to Savannah. Gas suppliers (Accugas) are mentioned specifically in the Power Gen bond prospectus but I've not seen any direct reference to them so far regarding payments. Hopefully we'll get some sort of an update soon from Save clarifying things.",

          "content": "Https://guardian.ng/featured/fg-issues-n501b-inaugural-power-sector-bond-to-clear-gencos-debts/ Federal Government of Nigeria has issued a N501 billion inaugural bond under the Presidential Power Sector Debt Reduction Programme (PPSDRP), recording 100 per cent subscription from pension funds, banks, asset managers, and other investors, marking a significant step towards resolving legacy debts, restoring liquidity, and strengthening confidence in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The programme, championed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is designed to address long-standing payment arrears owed to power generation companies, which for over a decade constrained liquidity, weakened balance sheets, and discouraged investment across the power sector value chain. The signing follows the successful completion of Series 1 Power Sector Bond Issuance by NBET Finance Company Plc. The Series 1 issuance closed at N501 billion, comprising N300 billion raised from the capital markets and N201 billion in bonds allotted to participating power generation companies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the reform agenda. Under the programme, verified receivables for electricity supplied between February 2015 and March 2025 are being settled through negotiated agreements with power generation companies. To date, five power generation companies representing fourteen power plants nationwide \u2013 First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), Geregu Power Plc, Ibom Power Company Limited, Mabon Limited, and Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) \u2013 have executed Settlement Agreements with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET).The total negotiated settlement amount for these companies stands at N827.16 billion, to be paid in four phased instalments. Proceeds from the Series 1 issuance will fund the first and second instalment payments to participating power generation companies with signed Settlement Agreements, estimated at N421.42 billion, representing approximately 50 per cent of the total negotiated settlement amount. Payments for this initial phase will be made through a mix of cash and notes. Speaking at the bond issuance signing ceremony in Lagos on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Arowolo Verheijen, stated that the programme represents a decisive reset of the electricity market, combining debt resolution with broader financial and structural reforms. Verheijen commended the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, as well as the support of the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, in making the PPSDRP a reality......",

Seplat Energy\u2019s (NGX: SEPLAT, LSE: SEPL) shares rose 6.2% on the NGX in the first trading week of 2026, reaching a 52-week high of NGN6,171 ($4.33), after Heirs Energies acquired a significant minority stake in the Nigerian oil and gas producer. Seplat is a Nigerian independent oil and gas company focused on the development and production of hydrocarbons in the Niger Delta. The rally followed Heirs Energies\u2019 acquisition of a 20.07% stake previously held by Maurel & Prom S.A., a transaction valued at about $500mn. The deal involved 120.4mn shares priced at \u00a33.05 ($4.09) each and was completed in late 2025. Investors viewed the purchase as a long-term endorsement of Seplat Energy\u2019s assets and growth strategy. Seplat Energy reported strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2025. Revenue rose 213% year on year to NGN3.36 trillion ($2.35bn), exceeding the company\u2019s combined revenue from 2020 to 2024. Operating profit before tax increased to NGN879bn ($616mn) from NGN367bn ($257mn) a year earlier. Net profit, however, declined to NGN147bn ($103mn) following a tax charge of NGN732bn ($513mn). Despite the higher tax burden, shareholder returns improved. Earnings per share rose 144% to NGN240.18. Dividends declared by the third quarter of 2025 amounted to 167 cents per share, or NGN157bn ($110mn), maintaining Seplat\u2019s position as one of the Nigerian Exchange\u2019s regular dividend-paying energy companies. Operational performance was driven by a 231% increase in crude oil sales to NGN3.1 trillion ($2.17bn). Output growth followed the integration of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited\u2019s offshore assets, which added more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well restoration activities contributed an additional 33,400 barrels per day. Although oil prices fell 13% during the period, total lifted volumes increased 270% to 27.9mn barrels. Gas revenue rose to NGN215bn ($151mn), supported by liquefied petroleum gas exports and condensate sales valued at NGN51bn ($36mn). Seplat Energy has set a target to double production to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, supported by planned capital expenditure of $2.5bn-$3bn. The company has said it expects to generate $5bn-$6bn in free cash flow and distribute up to $1bn in dividends over the period.",

The acquisition was completed through the BlueCore Gas InfraCo consortium \u2013 comprising Levene Energy, Afrigaz Energie, Energy& LLP and emPERSAND \u2013 and marks a key step in Levene Energy\u2019s transition from oil and refined products into a fully integrated and infrastructure-backed clean energy company. Through the transaction, the BlueCore consortium has acquired 100% of Axxela, purchasing the interests of Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation in a deal valued at approximately $285 million. The acquisition was supported by a structural debt and equity financing package arranged by Standard Bank. The acquisition aligns with BlueCore\u2019s strategy to scale gas and power infrastructure across West Africa, while positioning Levene Energy to participate in long-term energy transition assets supporting industrial demand and regional energy security. https://energycapitalpower.com/levene-energy-enters-nigerias-gas-market-with-axxela-equity-deal/ 9-1-2026 BlueCore acquires Axxela, signals confidence in Nigeria\u2019s gas infrastructure BlueCore Gas InfraCo Limited has completed the acquisition of Axxela Limited, a leading gas and power infrastructure company, from international owners Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation. The transaction highlighted the growing bankability of Nigeria\u2019s midstream gas assets, which are critical for power generation, industrial activity, and national energy security. Market participants view gas as a key transition fuel, enabling reliable power, reducing diesel use, and cutting gas flaring. \u201cThis transaction reflects a broader shift in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure investment landscape, where well-run operating assets are increasingly able to attract domestic long-term institutional capital,\u201d said Dolu Olugbenjo of Stanbic IBTC Asset Management. https://businessday.ng/energy/article/bluecore-acquires-axxela-signals-confidence-in-nigerias-gas-infrastructure/ For reference SAVE supply gas to an Axxela subsiduary.",

A few snippets - read the article for full details https://businessday.ng/energy/power/article/power-firms-turning-page-on-debt-as-fg-clears-arrears-sahara/ Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group, has said Nigeria\u2019s power sector is entering a more stable and investable phase, driven by Federal Government reforms and the gradual resolution of legacy debts that have long constrained growth across the electricity value chain. Adesina, during an interview, pointed out that recent infrastructure and macroeconomic policies under President Bola Tinubu had introduced a level of clarity and predictability that is reshaping investment decisions in the sector. He noted that the Administration\u2019s approach had helped address structural bottlenecks that previously undermined investor confidence. Besides, Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had already settled $438 million, about 73% of its original $600 million loan obligation, despite long standing liquidity challenges in the industry. According to him, the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing legacy debt settlement programme is critical to easing pressure on power companies, gas suppliers and lenders, while creating room for new capital inflows. He explained that improved policy coordination, relative exchange rate stability, easing inflationary pressures and moderated interest rates are allowing power sector operators to plan with greater conviction. Adesina added that the developments, combined with closer collaboration among government agencies, regulators, financiers and industry players, are laying the foundation for sustained growth and operational stability in Nigeria\u2019s electricity market. Sahara Power is Nigeria\u2019s foremost power company, responsible for about 19 per cent of total power generated in the nation. Its subsidiaries include Egbin Power Plc, the largest thermal power plant in sub Saharan Africa, First Independent Power Limited, a leading generating company in the Niger Delta, and Ikeja Electric, the largest privately run distribution company in sub-Saharan Africa. Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had undertaken extensive scenario planning and aligned its strategic objectives with what he described as the president\u2019s bold, clear-sighted and long-term oriented infrastructure plan. According to him, the administration has shown uncommon resolve in tackling structural bottlenecks that have historically constrained investment, particularly in the energy value chain.",

In Petronas accounts they were 'held for sale'. SHT pre-empted, as was their right, implying they paid the same as the Savannah offer. Perenco were apparently involved in financing the purchase. The sale was completed with a ceremony in Kuala Lumpar, and Petronas accounts stated 'no material effect' upon disposal, implying price received was similar to carrying value. This sets a precedent and a price on the Exxon/Savannah assets, and Savannah state that Chad admit that compensation is owed. Meanwhile the oil minister has changed since the nationalisation. Ndolenodji Alixe Naimbaye has no history of supporting nationalisation, and is currently trying to attract investment, for example SEMICA 2026 in January,  EGYPES in March. The World Bank is involved in financing several energy projects in Chad, eg Scatec $100m, PAAET $295m. The US is the largest shareholder in the World Bank, and we now know how Trump feels about nationalisation without compensation. Doba output has stagnated since nationalisation, due to a 'lack of investment'. Nationalisation without compensation has rarely succeeded, Gaddafi and Maduro both tried it... In all, it looks probable that Savannah will win significant compensation in arbitration. And this does not appear to be priced in at 8p/share.",

Savannah is in an exclusivity period in respect of the proposed acquisition of majority interests in a portfolio of renewable projects located in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an aggregate gross capacity in excess of 100 MW and a strong payment history. The proposed acquisition would also include a portfolio of renewable development projects in the same country with a targeted gross capacity of approximately 40 MW. The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources. This proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident of announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the next 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space\u201d. This acquisition is in addition to the Klinchenberg Transaction that is targeted to complete in Q1 2026. The statement that the \"proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah\" appears to me to be a message to the market that a suspension from a reverse takeover is unlikely in the foreseeable future, perhaps to alleviate PI jitters in this respect.",

'Deep exploration prize Meanwhile, in highly promising Block H in the Termit basin, CGIP is in talks with parties about investing in an asset covered by modern 3D seismic data, the resource potential of which exceeds 1 billion barrels and where a multi-well drilling campaign has been lined up.  Legacy operators on this block \u2014 including Conoco and Exxon \u2014 drilled 16 wells and made 11 oil discoveries, all Tertiary in age. One find, the SHT-operated Sedigui, has been carved out of the PSC and at one time supplied up to 3000 bpd of oil to a refinery north of Ndjamena via a 10,000 bpd pipeline. Levy said no oil currently flows in this pipeline, which will need to be rehabilitated to achieve its full capacity, so CGIP has had talks about potentially using it to tie in some early production from Block H. CGIP's initial focus is to drill delineation wells on existing discoveries that would also target deeper Cretaceous objectives not tackled by Delonex because in-country rigs could not reach these depths. Prime drilling objective The initial plan, said Levy, is to appraise the 40 million to 50 million-barrel Kanem discovery and then drill deeper into a Cretaceous formation that could hold a major prize, some 500 million barrels of oil. Levy stressed the exploration targets are \u201cgeologically independent\u201d so success or failure at one \u201cdoesn't say anything about the other prospects\u201d, while adding that drilling in the Termit basin in Niger has also been successful.

Some might say there's a degree of assumption by you in that post  MudPump, but I didn't hesitate to tick it up, as I potentially see plenty of merit in it. And, to extend such thinking further, I'd offer that if the company became aware of a size seller coming into play in the 7 's  or  8's  or 9's... etc... they might equally see merit in using spare treasury funds - if available at that time etc - to buy out that seller at a mutually agreeable price and again cancel those shares, thus continuing to facilitate any rally that might be in train  (I note AK personally hoovering some up at 8p ish  recently ish for eg ..etc..) And extending such thinking one step further again,  if cash collections continued on a good path thru coming 2026 months - include maybe even arbitration settlement monies into save Treasury too - then the company could formally announce a decent sized share buyback scheme, in due 2026  course.... which might well further facilitate a meaningful rally here..  etc.. imho & dyor",

Some might say there's a degree of assumption by you in that post  MudPump, but I didn't hesitate to tick it up, as I potentially see plenty of merit in it. And, to extend such thinking further, I'd offer that if the company became aware of a size seller coming into play in the 7 's  or  8's  or 9's... etc... they might equally see merit in using spare treasury funds - if available at that time etc - to buy out that seller at a mutually agreeable price and again cancel those shares, thus continuing to facilitate any rally that might be in train  (I note AK personally hoovering some up at 8p ish  recently ish for eg ..etc..) And extending such thinking one step further again,  if cash collections continued on a good path thru coming 2026 months - include maybe even arbitration settlement monies into save Treasury too - then the company could formally announce a decent sized share buyback scheme, in due 2026  course.... which might well further facilitate a meaningful rally here..  etc.. imho & dyor",

By restructuring these debts (backed by the government and needed industry reforms), the objective is to clean  up the balance sheets of key stakeholders, particularly GenCos and GasCos, enhance industry liquidity and promote investments in the sector. This in turn, will improve creditworthiness, enable better planning and  operations and unlock new capital for infrastructure upgrades, metering and generation expansion.",

These type of claims often carry fairly heavy compensatory interest and an interest rate of 6.5%-8% would put you in the ballpark of the interest accrued to date. The $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party is still stalled as far as I can make out and  the transaction only completes if certain pre\u2011set requirements are met, mainly around changes to COTCo\u2019s corporate rules and regional approvals, so even though the numbers are close it could well just be a  re-evaluation of the claim itself by Savannah and nothing to do with the proposed sale. Although today's update was mainly stuff we already knew, we have confirmation of the refinancing completion and a positive cash collection for January without any reference to a one-off payment via the power bond. Nipco have increased their stake which will please the conspiracy theorists, though why they aren't buying up all the stock up to 8p in readiness for a MO is beyond me ;-)",

Just a thought but possible that debtors can access some additional cash/loans from somewhere while they await the govt bond clearance. Compared to the previous financial update there was only an increase for receivables of $300k. Our debt/net debt is also affected by the interest pro-rata that is charged to us on the Exxon facility. One thing of note that in the last year or so the interest applied to the claims has gone up by $75m especially to around $1.4 billion overall. I wonder why the Cameroon section claim was changed from $380m to $330m mid last year (ish). Is that something to do with the $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party ? Any thoughts ? We must be paying some costs up front as well as these cases have been ongoing now 3 years. 4/2/26 SCI and SMIL are claiming in excess of US$775 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$215 million and costs) for the nationalisation of their rights and assets in Chad.4 SMIL has a claim valued at approximately US$330 million (plus interest which is currently estimated at in excess of US$67 million plus costs). 22/10/25.

The Director-General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Tanimu Yakubu, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja during a training and sensitisation workshop for ministries, departments, and agencies on the 2026 post-budget preparation process using the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System Budget Preparation Sub-System. Yakubu said President Bola Tinubu had directed that electricity subsidy costs be made explicit, tracked, and fairly shared across tiers of government, warning that the current approach creates hidden liabilities and recurring crises in the power market. \u201cIf we want a stable power sector, we must pay for the choices we make,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen tariffs are held below cost, a gap is created. That gap is a subsidy. And a subsidy is a bill.\u201d He added that from 2026, the Federal Government would no longer treat electricity subsidies as an open-ended obligation borne solely by the centre, especially where policy decisions and political benefits are shared. \u201cIn 2026, we will stop pretending that this bill can be left to the Federal Government alone, especially where the policy choice or the political benefit is shared across tiers of government,\u201d Yakubu said. According to him, the President has instructed that the existing electricity sector legal framework be invoked to ensure that subsidy sharing is practical, transparent, and enforceable. \u201cThis means subsidy costs must be explicit, tracked, and funded, so they do not return as arrears, liquidity crises, or hidden liabilities in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any tier of government chooses affordability interventions, the funding responsibilities must be clear, agreed, and enforceable.\u201d Yakubu stressed that the policy was not designed as a sanction but as a mechanism to align incentives across government and support efficiency in the power sector. \u201cThis is not punishment. It is alignment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen everyone carries a fair share of the cost, everyone also has an incentive to support cost-reflective efficiency, targeted protection for the vulnerable, and a power market that can actually deliver.\u201d He told MDAs to reflect subsidy-related costs clearly in their 2026 budget submissions and avoid pushing unfunded liabilities into the electricity market. Beyond power subsidies, Yakubu said the 2026 Budget marked a clear break from rollover budgeting and fragmented project lists, which he said had weakened execution and accountability over the years. \u201cThe 2026 Budget corrects this. It is built as one coherent implementation framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThe approach is to consolidate commitments into a single, visible pipeline and manage them as a disciplined programme of delivery.\u201d https://punchng.com/fg-moves-to-share-electricity-subsidy-cos",

Surely the Gencos could have more outstanding debt to agree on given they are higher up in the chain in terms of their overall invoiced sales with their costs and margins above that of the actual gas owed for. If SAVE got more of the receivables debt paid in a lump sum rather than waiting x years, it might be pragmatic who knows. They could put a bigger cash lump to better  use if they had it sooner rather than longer down the road. How much of the receivables are still on the books from before SAVE bought over Accugas when the sellers then took a haircut to the SAVE restructuring/buy-out ? On top of that we saw in April 2025 SAVE take a 50% cut in the outstanding balance owed from Fenikso of $11.525m and settled it for $5.7625m fully paid by Dec 2025. (Out of the $16.2m owed to Save on the original $1m investment, SAVE received a total of $10.4m paid and would have been waiting about another 4-5 years to receive it all). Perhaps there will or could be a reduction in the future make-up gas to supply ? From memory, i thought i recall at one investor Q&A in the past that they thought they might be able to offset something or do a deal with the government re a field/asset acquisition ?",

The key paragraph for me is: Ikon (Proton Energy CEO) told CNBC africa that the successful transaction marked a turning point for the industry by restoring cashflow and encouraging new investment.  He said generation companies had agreed to a 40% haircut on outstanding receivables in exchange for certainty of payment and improved market conditions. Now its hard to verify that 40%, but if that indeed is the case and the various gencos have accepted it, it might not necessarily be a bad thing.  If this means that SAVE has signed a similar agreement, does this mean we get certainty that we get $300m (60% of $500m) of our receivables paid sooner rather than later.  Does this improve the gas/electricity market over the medium to long term in Nigeria?",

' Nigeria\u2019s state oil company NNPC said on Dec. 29 it plans to sell stakes in selected oil and gas assets, launching a formal bidding process. Some of the assets are held directly by NNPC, while others are operated in partnership with international oil companies including Shell, Chevron, Eni and TotalEnergies. The company did not disclose the expected value of the sale or the size of the stakes on offer. Under the timetable released by NNPC, interested bidders must register online by Jan. 10, 2026. Companies will be selected through a pre-qualification process based on technical and financial capacity, followed by document reviews, negotiations and the obtaining of regulatory approvals. Shortlisted bidders will then be granted access to a secure virtual data room containing detailed information on the assets. The move reflects an NNPC strategy to divest at least 25% of certain interests, either through outright sales or reductions in joint venture holdings, as part of efforts to streamline its portfolio.

It is he sort of ingenious scheme that Andrew Knott is more than capable of designing and would go a long way to explain why Nipco was allowed to invest on such favourable terms. Small shareholders were outraged at the terms butmajor shareholders supported the proposal as reflected in some 99% of the votes cast in favour. I certainly hope that your interpretation is correct as it would once more let us think about th share in terms of \u00a3s rather than pence. Kinkell",

With Doba nationalised and Niger oil in the ground for the foreseeable future, subject to the whims of the Niger junta and CNPC, the best one can hope for is that Chad make a payout to avoid their Vision 2030 plan to attract investors look absurd. CNPC seem to be in trouble in Niger for not using enough local labour so perhaps there is an angle there for SAVE to exploit. But the bigger issue is 'what is the point of SAVE as a company ?' Is it renewables? There are focused funds for that, tied in with development agencies - I don't see Savannah's edge. Is it the 'generational' opportunities as the majors pull out of onshore? The locals seem to have the edge there, pretty dire results to date from AK.  Feels like an unwieldy conglomerate that has lost its sense or purpose as well as its auditors - if the vision was as an ethically secure way for funds to invest in African energy the audit problems certainly will not help. I assume NIPCO see their investment as securing their source of gas, having already built a retail operation - which does make sense. It would probably make even more sense for them to consolidate their control over Accugas and the other Nigerian assets, and dump the rest of the scattershot portfolio.",

Accugas also supplies gas to several National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) stations, many of which are government\u2011owned or managed through NDPHC (e.g. Ibom Power, though partially private). Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), a government corporation, acts as intermediary/guarantor for payments to GenCos, and thus indirectly to gas suppliers like Accugas when GenCos can't pay. So there is a strong tie-in between the govt.and Accugas. Calabar is it's biggest customer so hopefully payments to Calabar will filter through to Savannah. Gas suppliers (Accugas) are mentioned specifically in the Power Gen bond prospectus but I've not seen any direct reference to them so far regarding payments.

          "content": "Https://guardian.ng/featured/fg-issues-n501b-inaugural-power-sector-bond-to-clear-gencos-debts/ Federal Government of Nigeria has issued a N501 billion inaugural bond under the Presidential Power Sector Debt Reduction Programme (PPSDRP), recording 100 per cent subscription from pension funds, banks, asset managers, and other investors, marking a significant step towards resolving legacy debts, restoring liquidity, and strengthening confidence in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The programme, championed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is designed to address long-standing payment arrears owed to power generation companies, which for over a decade constrained liquidity, weakened balance sheets, and discouraged investment across the power sector value chain. The signing follows the successful completion of Series 1 Power Sector Bond Issuance by NBET Finance Company Plc. The Series 1 issuance closed at N501 billion, comprising N300 billion raised from the capital markets and N201 billion in bonds allotted to participating power generation companies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the reform agenda. Under the programme, verified receivables for electricity supplied between February 2015 and March 2025 are being settled through negotiated agreements with power generation companies. To date, five power generation companies representing fourteen power plants nationwide \u2013 First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), Geregu Power Plc, Ibom Power Company Limited, Mabon Limited, and Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) \u2013 have executed Settlement Agreements with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET).The total negotiated settlement amount for these companies stands at N827.16 billion, to be paid in four phased instalments. Proceeds from the Series 1 issuance will fund the first and second instalment payments to participating power generation companies with signed Settlement Agreements, estimated at N421.42 billion, representing approximately 50 per cent of the total negotiated settlement amount. Payments for this initial phase will be made through a mix of cash and notes. Speaking at the bond issuance signing ceremony in Lagos on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Arowolo Verheijen, stated that the programme represents a decisive reset of the electricity market, combining debt resolution with broader financial and structural reforms. Verheijen commended the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, as well as the support of the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, in making the PPSDRP a reality......",

Obvious value to Nipco of the up/mid stream Nigeria assets - instead of not getting paid for the gas it could be fed into their downstream assets, and sold for a handsome price. 2. Sale of the Niger assets to Chinese interests, they control the Benin pipeline and might be in a position to open up a second route through Chad/Cameroon 3. Sale of arbitration claims to a fund that knows the business - Elliot, Aurelius, Burford, Parabellum 4. Sale of renewable portfolio to a focused fund - AREF, ARCH, Evolution II Surely that would bring in significantly more than the current market cap?",

          "content": "... Seplat Energy\u2019s (NGX: SEPLAT, LSE: SEPL) shares rose 6.2% on the NGX in the first trading week of 2026, reaching a 52-week high of NGN6,171 ($4.33), after Heirs Energies acquired a significant minority stake in the Nigerian oil and gas producer. Seplat is a Nigerian independent oil and gas company focused on the development and production of hydrocarbons in the Niger Delta. The rally followed Heirs Energies\u2019 acquisition of a 20.07% stake previously held by Maurel & Prom S.A., a transaction valued at about $500mn. The deal involved 120.4mn shares priced at \u00a33.05 ($4.09) each and was completed in late 2025. Investors viewed the purchase as a long-term endorsement of Seplat Energy\u2019s assets and growth strategy. Seplat Energy reported strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2025. Revenue rose 213% year on year to NGN3.36 trillion ($2.35bn), exceeding the company\u2019s combined revenue from 2020 to 2024. Operating profit before tax increased to NGN879bn ($616mn) from NGN367bn ($257mn) a year earlier. Net profit, however, declined to NGN147bn ($103mn) following a tax charge of NGN732bn ($513mn). Despite the higher tax burden, shareholder returns improved. Earnings per share rose 144% to NGN240.18. Dividends declared by the third quarter of 2025 amounted to 167 cents per share, or NGN157bn ($110mn), maintaining Seplat\u2019s position as one of the Nigerian Exchange\u2019s regular dividend-paying energy companies. Operational performance was driven by a 231% increase in crude oil sales to NGN3.1 trillion ($2.17bn). Output growth followed the integration of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited\u2019s offshore assets, which added more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well restoration activities contributed an additional 33,400 barrels per day. Although oil prices fell 13% during the period, total lifted volumes increased 270% to 27.9mn barrels. Gas revenue rose to NGN215bn ($151mn), supported by liquefied petroleum gas exports and condensate sales valued at NGN51bn ($36mn). Seplat Energy has set a target to double production to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, supported by planned capital expenditure of $2.5bn-$3bn. The company has said it expects to generate $5bn-$6bn in free cash flow and distribute up to $1bn in dividends over the period.",

          "content": "9-1-2026 Energy services solutions provider Levene Energy has acquired an equity stake in natural gas company Axxela Limited, marking its entry into Nigeria\u2019s midstream and downstream gas sectors. The acquisition was completed through the BlueCore Gas InfraCo consortium \u2013 comprising Levene Energy, Afrigaz Energie, Energy& LLP and emPERSAND \u2013 and marks a key step in Levene Energy\u2019s transition from oil and refined products into a fully integrated and infrastructure-backed clean energy company. Through the transaction, the BlueCore consortium has acquired 100% of Axxela, purchasing the interests of Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation in a deal valued at approximately $285 million. The acquisition was supported by a structural debt and equity financing package arranged by Standard Bank. The acquisition aligns with BlueCore\u2019s strategy to scale gas and power infrastructure across West Africa, while positioning Levene Energy to participate in long-term energy transition assets supporting industrial demand and regional energy security. https://energycapitalpower.com/levene-energy-enters-nigerias-gas-market-with-axxela-equity-deal/ 9-1-2026 BlueCore acquires Axxela, signals confidence in Nigeria\u2019s gas infrastructure BlueCore Gas InfraCo Limited has completed the acquisition of Axxela Limited, a leading gas and power infrastructure company, from international owners Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation. The transaction highlighted the growing bankability of Nigeria\u2019s midstream gas assets, which are critical for power generation, industrial activity, and national energy security. Market participants view gas as a key transition fuel, enabling reliable power, reducing diesel use, and cutting gas flaring. \u201cThis transaction reflects a broader shift in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure investment landscape, where well-run operating assets are increasingly able to attract domestic long-term institutional capital,\u201d said Dolu Olugbenjo of Stanbic IBTC Asset Management. https://businessday.ng/energy/article/bluecore-acquires-axxela-signals-confidence-in-nigerias-gas-infrastructure/ For reference SAVE supply gas to an Axxela subsiduary.",

A few snippets - read the article for full details https://businessday.ng/energy/power/article/power-firms-turning-page-on-debt-as-fg-clears-arrears-sahara/ Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group, has said Nigeria\u2019s power sector is entering a more stable and investable phase, driven by Federal Government reforms and the gradual resolution of legacy debts that have long constrained growth across the electricity value chain. Adesina, during an interview, pointed out that recent infrastructure and macroeconomic policies under President Bola Tinubu had introduced a level of clarity and predictability that is reshaping investment decisions in the sector. He noted that the Administration\u2019s approach had helped address structural bottlenecks that previously undermined investor confidence. Besides, Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had already settled $438 million, about 73% of its original $600 million loan obligation, despite long standing liquidity challenges in the industry. According to him, the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing legacy debt settlement programme is critical to easing pressure on power companies, gas suppliers and lenders, while creating room for new capital inflows. He explained that improved policy coordination, relative exchange rate stability, easing inflationary pressures and moderated interest rates are allowing power sector operators to plan with greater conviction. Adesina added that the developments, combined with closer collaboration among government agencies, regulators, financiers and industry players, are laying the foundation for sustained growth and operational stability in Nigeria\u2019s electricity market. Sahara Power is Nigeria\u2019s foremost power company, responsible for about 19 per cent of total power generated in the nation. Its subsidiaries include Egbin Power Plc, the largest thermal power plant in sub Saharan Africa, First Independent Power Limited, a leading generating company in the Niger Delta, and Ikeja Electric, the largest privately run distribution company in sub-Saharan Africa. Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had undertaken extensive scenario planning and aligned its strategic objectives with what he described as the president\u2019s bold, clear-sighted and long-term oriented infrastructure plan. According to him, the administration has shown uncommon resolve in tackling structural bottlenecks that have historically constrained investment, particularly in the energy value chain.",

In Petronas accounts they were 'held for sale'. SHT pre-empted, as was their right, implying they paid the same as the Savannah offer. Perenco were apparently involved in financing the purchase. The sale was completed with a ceremony in Kuala Lumpar, and Petronas accounts stated 'no material effect' upon disposal, implying price received was similar to carrying value. This sets a precedent and a price on the Exxon/Savannah assets, and Savannah state that Chad admit that compensation is owed. Meanwhile the oil minister has changed since the nationalisation. Ndolenodji Alixe Naimbaye has no history of supporting nationalisation, and is currently trying to attract investment, for example SEMICA 2026 in January,  EGYPES in March. The World Bank is involved in financing several energy projects in Chad, eg Scatec $100m, PAAET $295m. The US is the largest shareholder in the World Bank, and we now know how Trump feels about nationalisation without compensation. Doba output has stagnated since nationalisation, due to a 'lack of investment'. Nationalisation without compensation has rarely succeeded, Gaddafi and Maduro both tried it... In all, it looks probable that Savannah will win significant compensation in arbitration. And this does not appear to be priced in at 8p/share.",

          "content": "It's unfortunate that a second renewables proposed acquisition with \"a strong payment history\" is hidden within the update. \"Future M&A Activity The Company continues to view mergers and acquisitions activity as a core driver of potential future value creation and is actively pursuing opportunities across both the hydrocarbon and renewable energy sectors. Savannah is in an exclusivity period in respect of the proposed acquisition of majority interests in a portfolio of renewable projects located in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an aggregate gross capacity in excess of 100 MW and a strong payment history. The proposed acquisition would also include a portfolio of renewable development projects in the same country with a targeted gross capacity of approximately 40 MW. The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources. This proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident of announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the next 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space\u201d. This acquisition is in addition to the Klinchenberg Transaction that is targeted to complete in Q1 2026. The statement that the \"proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah\" appears to me to be a message to the market that a suspension from a reverse takeover is unlikely in the foreseeable future, perhaps to alleviate PI jitters in this respect.",

Talks about continued financial improvement (as seen in 11 month RNS yesterday), the stability afforded by the two large shareholders (NIPCO and CEO), and the prospect of more M&A over and above the East African power projects during the next 24 months. Interestingly, no forecasts provided beyond 2025. Even if share price got half way to Cavendish's target, I would be elated. For transparency, SAVE is one of my \"shares for 2026\" and every time the CEO has bought, so have I . Consequently, I have quite a decent exposure.",

'Deep exploration prize Meanwhile, in highly promising Block H in the Termit basin, CGIP is in talks with parties about investing in an asset covered by modern 3D seismic data, the resource potential of which exceeds 1 billion barrels and where a multi-well drilling campaign has been lined up.  Legacy operators on this block \u2014 including Conoco and Exxon \u2014 drilled 16 wells and made 11 oil discoveries, all Tertiary in age. One find, the SHT-operated Sedigui, has been carved out of the PSC and at one time supplied up to 3000 bpd of oil to a refinery north of Ndjamena via a 10,000 bpd pipeline. Levy said no oil currently flows in this pipeline, which will need to be rehabilitated to achieve its full capacity, so CGIP has had talks about potentially using it to tie in some early production from Block H. CGIP's initial focus is to drill delineation wells on existing discoveries that would also target deeper Cretaceous objectives not tackled by Delonex because in-country rigs could not reach these depths. Prime drilling objective The initial plan, said Levy, is to appraise the 40 million to 50 million-barrel Kanem discovery and then drill deeper into a Cretaceous formation that could hold a major prize, some 500 million barrels of oil. Levy stressed the exploration targets are \u201cgeologically independent\u201d so success or failure at one \u201cdoesn't say anything about the other prospects\u201d, while adding that drilling in the Termit basin in Niger has also been successful. Overall, CGIP aims to undertake a six-well campaign in Block H and is in talks with rig owners to bring a suitable unit into Chad. Each well is expected to cost US$8 million to US$15 million, depending on the depths drilled, with tests carried out on the Tertiary discoveries as a matter of course. To fund this campaign, he said the company may bring in a partner.

Lake said: \u201cWe think a four-well programme could deliver about 450 million barrels of oil on a recoverable success basis,\u201d highlighting that such a volume could justify building an export pipeline with capacity of 110,000 bpd.

I wouldn't expect the buyback program to function much above this level due to optics - they issued stock at 7p. But if they're writing a put at 6.8p, an entry around 7p can be reframed as a cheap call option on management getting receivables down, some sort of arbitration settlement  and stock price that better reflects sum-of-the-parts.",

Some might say there's a degree of assumption by you in that post  MudPump, but I didn't hesitate to tick it up, as I potentially see plenty of merit in it. And, to extend such thinking further, I'd offer that if the company became aware of a size seller coming into play in the 7 's  or  8's  or 9's... etc... they might equally see merit in using spare treasury funds - if available at that time etc - to buy out that seller at a mutually agreeable price and again cancel those shares, thus continuing to facilitate any rally that might be in train  (I note AK personally hoovering some up at 8p ish  recently ish for eg ..etc..) And extending such thinking one step further again,  if cash collections continued on a good path thru coming 2026 months - include maybe even arbitration settlement monies into save Treasury too - then the company could formally announce a decent sized share buyback scheme, in due 2026  course.... which might well further facilitate a meaningful rally here..  etc.. imho & dyor",

And that the main holders noted by Zengas are not going to start selling at this sort of price. In which case the float is under 20%, and some of that will be holders with no intention to sell under 10. I wouldn't expect the buyback program to function much above this level due to optics - they issued stock at 7p. But if they're writing a put at 6.8p, an entry around 7p can be reframed as a cheap call option on management getting receivables down, some sort of arbitration settlement  and stock price that better reflects sum-of-the-parts.",

Some might say there's a degree of assumption by you in that post  MudPump, but I didn't hesitate to tick it up, as I potentially see plenty of merit in it. And, to extend such thinking further, I'd offer that if the company became aware of a size seller coming into play in the 7 's  or  8's  or 9's... etc... they might equally see merit in using spare treasury funds - if available at that time etc - to buy out that seller at a mutually agreeable price and again cancel those shares, thus continuing to facilitate any rally that might be in train  (I note AK personally hoovering some up at 8p ish  recently ish for eg ..etc..) And extending such thinking one step further again,  if cash collections continued on a good path thru coming 2026 months - include maybe even arbitration settlement monies into save Treasury too - then the company could formally announce a decent sized share buyback scheme, in due 2026  course.... which might well further facilitate a meaningful rally here..  etc.. imho & dyor",

And the s/p likely wouldn't do such if size sellers were, whatever, incrementally/continually selling down. So in doing a lot to clear those sellers out previously/recently/now, a situation has been/is being created  where a  decent/good 2026 s/p rise could readily enough happen, if good bottom line news is released. imho & dyor",

Either way, the situation is that Nipco can trigger it now by buying a single share.

By restructuring these debts (backed by the government and needed industry reforms), the objective is to clean  up the balance sheets of key stakeholders, particularly GenCos and GasCos, enhance industry liquidity and promote investments in the sector. This in turn, will improve creditworthiness, enable better planning and  operations and unlock new capital for infrastructure upgrades, metering and generation expansion.",

These type of claims often carry fairly heavy compensatory interest and an interest rate of 6.5%-8% would put you in the ballpark of the interest accrued to date. The $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party is still stalled as far as I can make out and  the transaction only completes if certain pre\u2011set requirements are met, mainly around changes to COTCo\u2019s corporate rules and regional approvals, so even though the numbers are close it could well just be a  re-evaluation of the claim itself by Savannah and nothing to do with the proposed sale. Although today's update was mainly stuff we already knew, we have confirmation of the refinancing completion and a positive cash collection for January without any reference to a one-off payment via the power bond. Nipco have increased their stake which will please the conspiracy theorists, though why they aren't buying up all the stock up to 8p in readiness for a MO is beyond me ;-)",

Just a thought but possible that debtors can access some additional cash/loans from somewhere while they await the govt bond clearance. Compared to the previous financial update there was only an increase for receivables of $300k. Our debt/net debt is also affected by the interest pro-rata that is charged to us on the Exxon facility. One thing of note that in the last year or so the interest applied to the claims has gone up by $75m especially to around $1.4 billion overall. I wonder why the Cameroon section claim was changed from $380m to $330m mid last year (ish). Is that something to do with the $44.9m stalled partial interest sale to the Cameroon party ?

          "content": "The Federal Government has moved to end the practice of carrying electricity subsidy costs alone, announcing a framework that will spread the burden across federal, state, and local governments from 2026. The Director-General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Tanimu Yakubu, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja during a training and sensitisation workshop for ministries, departments, and agencies on the 2026 post-budget preparation process using the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System Budget Preparation Sub-System. Yakubu said President Bola Tinubu had directed that electricity subsidy costs be made explicit, tracked, and fairly shared across tiers of government, warning that the current approach creates hidden liabilities and recurring crises in the power market. \u201cIf we want a stable power sector, we must pay for the choices we make,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen tariffs are held below cost, a gap is created. That gap is a subsidy. And a subsidy is a bill.\u201d He added that from 2026, the Federal Government would no longer treat electricity subsidies as an open-ended obligation borne solely by the centre, especially where policy decisions and political benefits are shared. \u201cIn 2026, we will stop pretending that this bill can be left to the Federal Government alone, especially where the policy choice or the political benefit is shared across tiers of government,\u201d Yakubu said. According to him, the President has instructed that the existing electricity sector legal framework be invoked to ensure that subsidy sharing is practical, transparent, and enforceable. \u201cThis means subsidy costs must be explicit, tracked, and funded, so they do not return as arrears, liquidity crises, or hidden liabilities in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any tier of government chooses affordability interventions, the funding responsibilities must be clear, agreed, and enforceable.\u201d Yakubu stressed that the policy was not designed as a sanction but as a mechanism to align incentives across government and support efficiency in the power sector. \u201cThis is not punishment. It is alignment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen everyone carries a fair share of the cost, everyone also has an incentive to support cost-reflective efficiency, targeted protection for the vulnerable, and a power market that can actually deliver.\u201d He told MDAs to reflect subsidy-related costs clearly in their 2026 budget submissions and avoid pushing unfunded liabilities into the electricity market. Beyond power subsidies, Yakubu said the 2026 Budget marked a clear break from rollover budgeting and fragmented project lists, which he said had weakened execution and accountability over the years. \u201cThe 2026 Budget corrects this. It is built as one coherent implementation framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThe approach is to consolidate commitments into a single, visible pipeline and manage them as a disciplined programme of delivery.\u201d https://punchng.com/fg-moves-to-share-electricity-subsidy-cos",

Surely the Gencos could have more outstanding debt to agree on given they are higher up in the chain in terms of their overall invoiced sales with their costs and margins above that of the actual gas owed for. If SAVE got more of the receivables debt paid in a lump sum rather than waiting x years, it might be pragmatic who knows. They could put a bigger cash lump to better  use if they had it sooner rather than longer down the road. How much of the receivables are still on the books from before SAVE bought over Accugas when the sellers then took a haircut to the SAVE restructuring/buy-out ? On top of that we saw in April 2025 SAVE take a 50% cut in the outstanding balance owed from Fenikso of $11.525m and settled it for $5.7625m fully paid by Dec 2025. (Out of the $16.2m owed to Save on the original $1m investment, SAVE received a total of $10.4m paid and would have been waiting about another 4-5 years to receive it all). Perhaps there will or could be a reduction in the future make-up gas to supply ?

These unpaid obligations which stem from years of  under-remitted payments by DisCos, inadequate tariffs and shortfalls in government subsidies have led to a crippling liquidity crisis, discouraging further investments and weakening the overall supply chain. By restructuring these debts (backed by the government and needed industry reforms), the objective is to clean  up the balance sheets of key stakeholders, particularly GenCos and GasCos, enhance industry liquidity and  promote investments in the sector. This in turn, will improve creditworthiness, enable better planning and  operations and unlock new capital for infrastructure upgrades, metering and generation expansion.

In this regard, the Government successfully launched a NGN590 billion first tranche bond issuance in Q4 2025, as part of a wider NGN4 trillion bond programme to settle verified legacy invoices owed to Gencos and gas suppliers. This has created renewed positive momentum in the discussions Accugas Ltd, an 80% Savannah owned subsidiary, is having with its offtakers that are Gencos around the repayment of the Company's outstanding receivables balance in an accelerated manner.' The use of the word 'subsequently' suggests possibly that the gas suppliers may not be included in the first tranche of the bond programme, hence nothing as yet to RNS. As regards the offtakers that are Gencos, it seems that they are negotiating directly with them about accelerated payments, which will undoubtedly create a time lag from the point at which the Gencos receive their payments.",

The key paragraph for me is: Ikon (Proton Energy CEO) told CNBC africa that the successful transaction marked a turning point for the industry by restoring cashflow and encouraging new investment.  He said generation companies had agreed to a 40% haircut on outstanding receivables in exchange for certainty of payment and improved market conditions. Now its hard to verify that 40%, but if that indeed is the case and the various gencos have accepted it, it might not necessarily be a bad thing.  If this means that SAVE has signed a similar agreement, does this mean we get certainty that we get $300m (60% of $500m) of our receivables paid sooner rather than later.  Does this improve the gas/electricity market over the medium to long term in Nigeria?",

Just my opinion but perhaps SAVEs renewables/Power projects and pipeline imo sits with the Kansagra family interests of expansion across Africa as in Nigeria and other sectors. If the receivables are addressed ($200m out of $500m. Can it be resolved in its entirety over next 24 months ? ) and the Chad/Cameroon assets give a successful award ($300m out of $1.4b). It would contribute significantly to the turnaround of the company. Nipcos 26.41% stake (7p) has cost them \u00a339.2m ($52m+).  AKs reinvestment now around \u00a318m and total holding of \u00a320.5m. Pound/Dollar now \u00a31/$1.37. Dollar/Naira $1/N1390.",

Obvious value to Nipco of the up/mid stream Nigeria assets - instead of not getting paid for the gas it could be fed into their downstream assets, and sold for a handsome price. 2. Sale of the Niger assets to Chinese interests, they control the Benin pipeline and might be in a position to open up a second route through Chad/Cameroon 3. Sale of arbitration claims to a fund that knows the business - Elliot, Aurelius, Burford, Parabellum 4.

With Doba nationalised and Niger oil in the ground for the foreseeable future, subject to the whims of the Niger junta and CNPC, the best one can hope for is that Chad make a payout to avoid their Vision 2030 plan to attract investors look absurd. CNPC seem to be in trouble in Niger for not using enough local labour so perhaps there is an angle there for SAVE to exploit. But the bigger issue is 'what is the point of SAVE as a company ?' Is it renewables? There are focused funds for that, tied in with development agencies - I don't see Savannah's edge. Is it the 'generational' opportunities as the majors pull out of onshore? The locals seem to have the edge there, pretty dire results to date from AK.  Feels like an unwieldy conglomerate that has lost its sense or purpose as well as its auditors - if the vision was as an ethically secure way for funds to invest in African energy the audit problems certainly will not help. I assume NIPCO see their investment as securing their source of gas, having already built a retail operation - which does make sense. It would probably make even more sense for them to consolidate their control over Accugas and the other Nigerian assets, and dump the rest of the scattershot portfolio.",

Calabar Generation Company (Calabar GenCo): A major Accugas customer, owned by Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), a government entity under the Federal Ministry of Power. Accugas also supplies gas to several National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) stations, many of which are government\u2011owned or managed through NDPHC (e.g. Ibom Power, though partially private). Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), a government corporation, acts as intermediary/guarantor for payments to GenCos, and thus indirectly to gas suppliers like Accugas when GenCos can't pay. So there is a strong tie-in between the govt.and Accugas. Calabar is it's biggest customer so hopefully payments to Calabar will filter through to Savannah. Gas suppliers (Accugas) are mentioned specifically in the Power Gen bond prospectus but I've not seen any direct reference to them so far regarding payments.

          "content": "Https://guardian.ng/featured/fg-issues-n501b-inaugural-power-sector-bond-to-clear-gencos-debts/ Federal Government of Nigeria has issued a N501 billion inaugural bond under the Presidential Power Sector Debt Reduction Programme (PPSDRP), recording 100 per cent subscription from pension funds, banks, asset managers, and other investors, marking a significant step towards resolving legacy debts, restoring liquidity, and strengthening confidence in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). The programme, championed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is designed to address long-standing payment arrears owed to power generation companies, which for over a decade constrained liquidity, weakened balance sheets, and discouraged investment across the power sector value chain. The signing follows the successful completion of Series 1 Power Sector Bond Issuance by NBET Finance Company Plc. The Series 1 issuance closed at N501 billion, comprising N300 billion raised from the capital markets and N201 billion in bonds allotted to participating power generation companies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the reform agenda. Under the programme, verified receivables for electricity supplied between February 2015 and March 2025 are being settled through negotiated agreements with power generation companies. To date, five power generation companies representing fourteen power plants nationwide \u2013 First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), Geregu Power Plc, Ibom Power Company Limited, Mabon Limited, and Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) \u2013 have executed Settlement Agreements with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET).The total negotiated settlement amount for these companies stands at N827.16 billion, to be paid in four phased instalments. Proceeds from the Series 1 issuance will fund the first and second instalment payments to participating power generation companies with signed Settlement Agreements, estimated at N421.42 billion, representing approximately 50 per cent of the total negotiated settlement amount. Payments for this initial phase will be made through a mix of cash and notes. Speaking at the bond issuance signing ceremony in Lagos on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Arowolo Verheijen, stated that the programme represents a decisive reset of the electricity market, combining debt resolution with broader financial and structural reforms. Verheijen commended the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, as well as the support of the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, and the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, in making the PPSDRP a reality......",

Hopefully it means we are getting closer to a fixed repayment plan for SAVE's legacy debt (\u00a3500m receivables balance).  Hopefully we can get more info soon from SAVE themselves on this.  Did email Sally from IR on what happened to the Retail investor coffee morning, but as of yet no reply.",

          "content": "... Seplat Energy\u2019s (NGX: SEPLAT, LSE: SEPL) shares rose 6.2% on the NGX in the first trading week of 2026, reaching a 52-week high of NGN6,171 ($4.33), after Heirs Energies acquired a significant minority stake in the Nigerian oil and gas producer. Seplat is a Nigerian independent oil and gas company focused on the development and production of hydrocarbons in the Niger Delta. The rally followed Heirs Energies\u2019 acquisition of a 20.07% stake previously held by Maurel & Prom S.A., a transaction valued at about $500mn. The deal involved 120.4mn shares priced at \u00a33.05 ($4.09) each and was completed in late 2025. Investors viewed the purchase as a long-term endorsement of Seplat Energy\u2019s assets and growth strategy. Seplat Energy reported strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2025. Revenue rose 213% year on year to NGN3.36 trillion ($2.35bn), exceeding the company\u2019s combined revenue from 2020 to 2024. Operating profit before tax increased to NGN879bn ($616mn) from NGN367bn ($257mn) a year earlier. Net profit, however, declined to NGN147bn ($103mn) following a tax charge of NGN732bn ($513mn). Despite the higher tax burden, shareholder returns improved. Earnings per share rose 144% to NGN240.18. Dividends declared by the third quarter of 2025 amounted to 167 cents per share, or NGN157bn ($110mn), maintaining Seplat\u2019s position as one of the Nigerian Exchange\u2019s regular dividend-paying energy companies. Operational performance was driven by a 231% increase in crude oil sales to NGN3.1 trillion ($2.17bn). Output growth followed the integration of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited\u2019s offshore assets, which added more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well restoration activities contributed an additional 33,400 barrels per day. Although oil prices fell 13% during the period, total lifted volumes increased 270% to 27.9mn barrels. Gas revenue rose to NGN215bn ($151mn), supported by liquefied petroleum gas exports and condensate sales valued at NGN51bn ($36mn). Seplat Energy has set a target to double production to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, supported by planned capital expenditure of $2.5bn-$3bn. The company has said it expects to generate $5bn-$6bn in free cash flow and distribute up to $1bn in dividends over the period.",

The acquisition was completed through the BlueCore Gas InfraCo consortium \u2013 comprising Levene Energy, Afrigaz Energie, Energy& LLP and emPERSAND \u2013 and marks a key step in Levene Energy\u2019s transition from oil and refined products into a fully integrated and infrastructure-backed clean energy company. Through the transaction, the BlueCore consortium has acquired 100% of Axxela, purchasing the interests of Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation in a deal valued at approximately $285 million. The acquisition was supported by a structural debt and equity financing package arranged by Standard Bank. The acquisition aligns with BlueCore\u2019s strategy to scale gas and power infrastructure across West Africa, while positioning Levene Energy to participate in long-term energy transition assets supporting industrial demand and regional energy security. https://energycapitalpower.com/levene-energy-enters-nigerias-gas-market-with-axxela-equity-deal/ 9-1-2026 BlueCore acquires Axxela, signals confidence in Nigeria\u2019s gas infrastructure BlueCore Gas InfraCo Limited has completed the acquisition of Axxela Limited, a leading gas and power infrastructure company, from international owners Helios Investment Partners and Sojitz Corporation. The transaction highlighted the growing bankability of Nigeria\u2019s midstream gas assets, which are critical for power generation, industrial activity, and national energy security. Market participants view gas as a key transition fuel, enabling reliable power, reducing diesel use, and cutting gas flaring. \u201cThis transaction reflects a broader shift in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure investment landscape, where well-run operating assets are increasingly able to attract domestic long-term institutional capital,\u201d said Dolu Olugbenjo of Stanbic IBTC Asset Management. https://businessday.ng/energy/article/bluecore-acquires-axxela-signals-confidence-in-nigerias-gas-infrastructure/ For reference SAVE supply gas to an Axxela subsiduary.",

          "content": "Interesting article from Business Day. A few snippets - read the article for full details https://businessday.ng/energy/power/article/power-firms-turning-page-on-debt-as-fg-clears-arrears-sahara/ Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group, has said Nigeria\u2019s power sector is entering a more stable and investable phase, driven by Federal Government reforms and the gradual resolution of legacy debts that have long constrained growth across the electricity value chain. Adesina, during an interview, pointed out that recent infrastructure and macroeconomic policies under President Bola Tinubu had introduced a level of clarity and predictability that is reshaping investment decisions in the sector. He noted that the Administration\u2019s approach had helped address structural bottlenecks that previously undermined investor confidence. Besides, Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had already settled $438 million, about 73% of its original $600 million loan obligation, despite long standing liquidity challenges in the industry. According to him, the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing legacy debt settlement programme is critical to easing pressure on power companies, gas suppliers and lenders, while creating room for new capital inflows. He explained that improved policy coordination, relative exchange rate stability, easing inflationary pressures and moderated interest rates are allowing power sector operators to plan with greater conviction. Adesina added that the developments, combined with closer collaboration among government agencies, regulators, financiers and industry players, are laying the foundation for sustained growth and operational stability in Nigeria\u2019s electricity market. Sahara Power is Nigeria\u2019s foremost power company, responsible for about 19 per cent of total power generated in the nation. Its subsidiaries include Egbin Power Plc, the largest thermal power plant in sub Saharan Africa, First Independent Power Limited, a leading generating company in the Niger Delta, and Ikeja Electric, the largest privately run distribution company in sub-Saharan Africa. Adesina disclosed that Sahara Power had undertaken extensive scenario planning and aligned its strategic objectives with what he described as the president\u2019s bold, clear-sighted and long-term oriented infrastructure plan. According to him, the administration has shown uncommon resolve in tackling structural bottlenecks that have historically constrained investment, particularly in the energy value chain.",

In Petronas accounts they were 'held for sale'. SHT pre-empted, as was their right, implying they paid the same as the Savannah offer. Perenco were apparently involved in financing the purchase. The sale was completed with a ceremony in Kuala Lumpar, and Petronas accounts stated 'no material effect' upon disposal, implying price received was similar to carrying value. This sets a precedent and a price on the Exxon/Savannah assets, and Savannah state that Chad admit that compensation is owed. Meanwhile the oil minister has changed since the nationalisation. Ndolenodji Alixe Naimbaye has no history of supporting nationalisation, and is currently trying to attract investment, for example SEMICA 2026 in January,  EGYPES in March. The World Bank is involved in financing several energy projects in Chad, eg Scatec $100m, PAAET $295m. The US is the largest shareholder in the World Bank, and we now know how Trump feels about nationalisation without compensation. Doba output has stagnated since nationalisation, due to a 'lack of investment'. Nationalisation without compensation has rarely succeeded, Gaddafi and Maduro both tried it... In all, it looks probable that Savannah will win significant compensation in arbitration. And this does not appear to be priced in at 8p/share.",

Savannah is in an exclusivity period in respect of the proposed acquisition of majority interests in a portfolio of renewable projects located in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an aggregate gross capacity in excess of 100 MW and a strong payment history. The proposed acquisition would also include a portfolio of renewable development projects in the same country with a targeted gross capacity of approximately 40 MW. The transaction, which remains subject to the execution of long-form documentation and other customary conditions, is envisaged to involve a potential gross consideration in the US$70 million to US$90 million range and would be expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash resources. This proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah. However, shareholders are advised that there can be no certainty that the transaction will proceed on the above summarised terms or be completed at all. The Company maintains an active business development pipeline comprising a number of potential transactions at various stages of evaluation, although no other opportunities have, at this stage, reached such a level to necessitate disclosure under applicable regulations. The Business development pipeline is sufficiently large that we are however confident of announcing further transaction(s) over the course of the next 24 months in the African oil and gas and power space\u201d. This acquisition is in addition to the Klinchenberg Transaction that is targeted to complete in Q1 2026. The statement that the \"proposed acquisition represents the most advanced transaction currently being progressed by Savannah\" appears to me to be a message to the market that a suspension from a reverse takeover is unlikely in the foreseeable future, perhaps to alleviate PI jitters in this respect.",
