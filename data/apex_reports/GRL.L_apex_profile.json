Gold production for the Period totalled\n90.6 kilos of gold\n,\nequivalent to 2,912 troy ounces, all of which was sold during the Period (refined from 113 kilos of dor\u00e9, equivalent to 3,640 ounces). This generated\napproximately US$10 million\nin revenue, at an average realised gold price of approximately\nUS$3,464/oz - compared with a weighted average gold price of approximately US$3,325/oz during the Period.\nTotal material mined during the Period was approximately 744,000 tonnes, including approximately 144,000 tonnes of ore, which is consistent with the reported gold production.\nOperations during the Period were impacted by a combination of increased frequency of regulatory inspections, all of which were dealt with in a professional and satisfactory manner, but nonetheless were time consuming and diverted management focus from routine operational activities, and an unusually heavy rainy season which resulted in three months of heavy rainfall.\nThe heavy rainfall disrupted mining operations and the stacking of agglomerated ore, and average stacked ore volumes reduced from approximately\n36,000 tonnes per month\nto\n14,000 tonnes per month\n. Leach performance was also affected during the Period due to increased solution dilution.\nMining and Processing Plan\nDuring the Period, the Company continued to advance its heap leach and processing infrastructure. A new\nscreening and conveying system was completed and\ncommissioned in\nDecember 2025\n, enabling stacking rates of up to\n56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month\n, providing increased operational flexibility.\nMining in 2026 will continue to focus on near-surface oxide material from the Homase Mine open pit operations. Ore will be sourced primarily from\u00a0Pit 3, which the Company began mining in December 2025, following the completion of the Pit 1 pushback which gave access to\napproximately\n100,000 tonnes of ore\n, which\nwas completed during the Period\n.\nThe mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods, with moderated mining and stacking rates during the wetter months to reduce the impact of rainfall on mining continuity, agglomeration and leach performance. An additional intermediary pond has been included in the FY26 budget to further mitigate solution dilution.\nSubject to permitting, and the further expansion of the heap leach pad area, the Company expects to mine approximately\u00a0250,000 tonnes of ore\u00a0during FY26, at an average mined grade of approximately\u00a01.0 g/t of gold.\nHeap Leach Pad Capacity\nHeap leach operations are dependent on favourable dry-season operating conditions, and are planned at an average stacking rate of approximately\u00a036,000 tonnes per month, with the variations between 14,000 - 56,000 tonnes per month, consistent with historical performance,\nDuring 2026, ore stacking will be supported by the existing leach pads together with\u00a0Pad 6, which is currently under construction and scheduled for geomembrane lining and commissioning in Q1 2026. Pad 6 measures approximately\u00a0160 metres by 120 metres\u00a0and represents the largest leach pad constructed at the Homase mine to date, providing additional stacking flexibility and operational resilience.\nProduction Guidance\nBased on the planned mining and stacking profile, heap leach recovery characteristics of oxide material and the available leach pad capacity, the Company is targeting total gold production of approximately 4,000 ounces of gold in FY26.\nThis guidance assumes average metallurgical recoveries of approximately 68%, in line with historical oxide performance and normal seasonal variability.\nFinancial Performance and Guidance\nGoldStone has been\nself-funding since January 2023\nand, during the Period, reduced its historical balance sheet liabilities by settling approximately\nUS$2.5 million of historical creditor balances\n.\nThe Company achieved an average\nAll-In Sustaining Cost (\"AISC\") of US$2,781 per ounce\nfor the year to November 2025.\nFor FY26, AISC is expected to be approximately US$2,500 - US$2,900 per ounce reflecting:\n\u00b7\nIncreased stacking and leach pad capacity\n\u00b7\nImproved equipment utilisation\n\u00b7\nOngoing cost discipline\n\u00b7\nSeasonal rainfall adjustments\nCapital Expenditure\nCapital expenditure in respect of the Homase Mine during FY26 is expected to be limited and largely restricted to:\n\u00b7\nCompletion and commissioning of Pad 6\n\u00b7\nExpansion of the adsorption plant\n\u00b7\nConstruction of an intermediary pond to enhance recovery\n\u00b7\nRoutine maintenance capital for mining and processing equipment\nCommunity Engagement\nThe Mine Clinic, completed during the Period, is now fully operational and open to local communities. In addition, construction has commenced on a new\ncommunity centre in Krodua village\n, reinforcing the Company's ongoing commitment to local development and stakeholder engagement.\nBoard Changes\nAs announced on 22 December 2025, the Company appointed\ntwo new directors\nto the Board. These appointments are intended to strengthen the Board's collective experience and support GoldStone as it advances its operational and corporate objectives.\nOutlook\nDespite operational challenges experienced during the Period, the Board believes that the Homase Mine is well positioned to deliver improved operational consistency in 2026. With mining access established, enhanced heap leach infrastructure in place and disciplined planning around seasonal conditions, the Company remains focused on maximising cash generation, strengthening its financial position. This was supported by\nAsian Investment Management Services Ltd\nextending the Gold Loan maturity date to 31 December 2026 and the\ninterest payments being\u00a0frozen to 30 June 2026\n, as announced on 30 December 2025, which will help the Company in continuing to develop its resource base to deliver long-term value for shareholders.\nEmma Priestley, Chief Executive Officer of GoldStone Resources Limited, commented:\n\"The past year has seen steady operational progress at our Ghanaian operation. While we faced challenges from numerous regulatory inspections and unusually heavy rainfall, resulting in operational disruptions, the team has continued to advance key infrastructure and improved the Company's financial position with the added support from our major shareholder\nAsian Investment Management Services Ltd\n.\n\"With the strengthening of the Board, the Company is well placed to continue focusing on operational stability and incremental improvements as we move into the next phase of development.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.
