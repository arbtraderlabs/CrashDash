Therefore, it quickly became apparent that significant optimisation work was required in order to enhance recoveries due to agglomeration issues.\nTo undertake this, further investment was required and a\nconvertible loan note was entered into on 27 January 2023 with Blue Gold International Limited (\"\nBGL\n\") in the nominal amount of \u00a32,400,000 (the \"\nLoan Notes\n\") which is due for redemption on 30 November 2024. At the election of BGL, the Loan Notes (together with accrued interest to date) may be converted (in whole or in part) at any time prior to redemption into new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary\nShares\n\") at a conversion price of \u00a30.0325 per share. BGL has also received warrants to subscribe for up to 60,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of \u00a30.04 per share exercisable at any time until 26 January 2025.\nThe proceeds from the Loan Notes contributed towards the purchase of plant and equipment, including a radial stacker, to assist in reducing the operating costs of the operation, increase production, and improve the recovery rate of the heap leach operation, which during 2022 yielded 65% of the contained gold delivered to the heap.\nThe team immediately commenced detailed test work and cost analysis to further understand the leach kinetics in order to optimise the recovery of the remaining contained gold in the heap. This work informed the reconfiguration of the agglomeration and crushing circuit to handle the excess clay encountered and the greater than expected amount of silt originating from the oxide orebody's fragile phyllitic content. A modified screening system has been designed and built to control the feed sizing, which has allowed for the oversize >80mm to be removed from the circuit thus allowing for more consistency within the agglomeration drum.\nThis work programme improved recoveries from the heap leach operation, however our ability to regain some lost ground from our initial production target has been further frustrated by a very extreme and prolonged rainy season, which significantly curtailed stacking from June to October 2023. Production for the year to 31 December 2023 was 95,497 tonnes of ore, agglomerated and stacked, averaging 1g/t Au with 1,275.25 oz of gold bullion sold at an average price USD1,969.82/oz. This was a disappointing result for us, however, the practical and learned experiences should ensure that our production trajectory improves going forward.\nAs shareholders will be aware, the current available mineable resource from the first pit within the Homase Mine was estimated by management to be 304,000 tonnes @ 1.7g/t of oxide ore. From the second pit, it is estimated by management that there is 640,000 tonnes @ 1.1g/t of oxide ore, which was derived from the update regarding the mineable resource announced on 12 November 2020. The mineable resource is within the confines of the 602,000oz JORC (2012) resource previously announced.\nExploration\nThe Akrokeri Licence is a primary exploration focus of our geological team, and they are working tirelessly with the aim of adding a significant deposit to GoldStone. The exploration centred on the former Akrokeri Underground Mine and along strike from it. During the period and post period end, our operational team continue with the reassessment of the former mine workings and artisanal mine workings, building the database with historical exploration work and consolidating historical geological reports that reference not just the Akrokeri Mine but also other historical exploration targets in the vicinity of the Akrokeri Mine.\nThe main ore body at Akrokeri is a lenticular quartz-carbonate vein, in places with parallels, within a substantial mineralized structural corridor, trending north and dipping to the west at about 70\u00b0. It lies on the eastern contact of a massive granitoid within Birimian-age meta-sedimentary units, predominantly phyllites that dip steeply north-west. The contained gold mineralisation occurs as coarse visible gold and is also associated with pyrite, arsenopyrite, and galena in the vein-quartz and in altered wallrocks.\nIn August 2022, we commenced a Diamond Drilling programme at Akrokeri to advance high-priority gold targets towards production. Akrokeri benefits from both the right geological setting, being approximately 12km NNE and along strike from the Obuasi Mine, owned by AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, and its potential is supported by verified accounts of historical production, reported to be some 75,000 ounces of gold from approximately 104,000 tons (94,347 tonnes) of ore, equating to an average recovered grade equivalent to approximately 24g/t. A total of 20 diamond drillholes were drilled, totaling 1,979.5 metres, 14 probing the southern extension of the South Shaft of the former Akrokeri Mine and the remaining six holes around the North Shaft, which sits half a kilometre north of the South Shaft.\nThe assays completed and announced on 5 April 2023 showed there is a significant mineralised lode hosting gold at 4.1m @ 11.01 g/t, including 1m @ 41.04 g/t in hole 22AKDD002. This gold-bearing zone has been defined over a distance of approximately 360 metres southwards from the South Shaft, at which point it appeared that there may be a significant fault that displaces the zone westwards. The results from this exploration programme provided an explanation as to why the southern extension had not been identified at the surface in the past and has provided a basis to continue exploring this part of the historical mine area.\nIn addition, an area, approximately 2km south of the South Shaft, hosts sulphide-rich sheared metasediments which were identified from the interpretation of the drilling results and assays, this underpins the probability that this southern area has considerable potential and merits further systematic exploration. These results give strong grounds for continued exploration and further core drilling at Akrokeri.\nThe Company continues to review all current and historical data derived from the exploration program at Akrokeri, and from continued exploration along the Homase Trend, including targeted soil geochemistry from soil and auger sampling.\nResults from exploration at the Homase trend confirmed anomalies that demonstrate a new mineralised zone to the west of the main Homase orebody and also shows further extension along strike to the north and south of the known Homase Trend.\nCorporate and Financial Review\nLosses from operations for the six months to 30 June 2023 were US$3.1 million (H1 2022: loss of US$0.3 million).\nThe financial statements at the end of the Period show the Group's balance sheet, with net assets standing at US$8.6 million (H1 2022: US$16.0 million).\nCash and cash equivalents as at 30 June 2023 were US0.3 million (as at 30 June 2022: US$0.9 million).\nOn 3 January 2024, the Company announced a standstill agreement with AIMSL in respect of its Gold Loan agreement (the \"\nStandstill\nAgreement\n\"). This Standstill Agreement, which was necessary due to the inability to complete a negotiation on an extension within the appropriate timeframe, provided the Company with the potential to defer repayment of the gold loan until 29 June 2024.\nAs announced on 10 April 2024, the Company has conditionally raised \u00a31.82 million before expenses by way of the Subscription of, in aggregate, 182,000,000 new Ordinary Shares at a price of 1 penny per Subscription Share together with one warrant per Subscription Share to subscribe for a further new Ordinary Share at an exercise price of 2 pence during the period of 24 months from the date of Admission (the \"\nWarrants\n\") (the \"\nSubscription\n\").\nThe net proceeds of the Subscription will be used to partially settle the Company's overdue creditor balances in line with payment plans agreed with the Company's major creditors, to progress the Company's strategy of developing and improving production at its Homase Mine in Ghana and for general working capital purposes.\nAs also announced on 10 April 2024, the Company has entered into an agreement (the \"\nAmendment\nAgreement\n\") with AIMSL in respect of the Gold Loan Agreement to extend the Standstill Period under terms of the Standstill Agreement dated 29 December 2023, to 31 December 2025. Pursuant to the Amendment Agreement, AIMSL has also agreed to accept settlement of the interest accrued under the Gold Loan Agreement to 31 December 2023 by the issue to AIMSL of 101,803,680 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nConversion\nShares\n\"). Following and subject to issue of the Conversion Shares, the outstanding balance in respect of the Gold Loan and accrued interest will be reduced to the principal of 1,871.43 troy ounces and will accrue interest at 14% from 1 January 2024.\nOutlook\nIt is with cautious optimism that I look forward to 2024. 2023 was a difficult period of hard-won lessons, but these lessons will be valuable as we go into H2 2024.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their patience and continued support, and I look forward to reporting on our progress moving forward.\nEmma Priestley\nChief Executive Officer\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nS.

information\nThe financial statements present the consolidated results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the \"\nGroup\n\") for each of the periods ending 30 June 2023, 30 June 2022 and 31 December 2022.\nAs permitted, the Group has chosen not to adopt International Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' in preparing these interim financial statements. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.\nThe unaudited interim financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts. The information has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK adopted International Accounting Standards. Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in preparing the interim financial information are consistent with those that have been adopted in the Group's 2022 audited financial statements. Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors on 10 April 2024 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was qualified, as set out in the auditors report therein. The Directors approved these unaudited condensed interim financial statements on 10 April 2024.\nThere are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 January 2023 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.\nThe financial information for the 6 months ended 30 June 2023 and the 6 months ended 30 June 2022 have not been audited.\nThe business is not subject to seasonal variations. No dividends have been paid in the period (2022: US$ Nil).\n2.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe key risks that could affect the Group's short and medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the Group's 2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements, a copy of which is available on the Company's website:\nwww.goldstoneresources.com\n.The Group's key financial risks are the availability of adequate funding and foreign exchange movements.\n3.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in note 2(d) of the Group's 2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the measurement of certain investments at fair value.\n4.\nEarnings per share\nin united states dollars\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2023\n6 months ended\n30 June\n2022\nyear ended\n31 December\n2022\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\nloss attributable to shareholders (in USD)\n(3,711,249)\n(648,167)\n(674,413)\nweighted average number of ordinary shares\n368,618,154\n360,234,874\n367,663,379\nbasic and diluted earnings per share (in USD)\n(0.010)\n(0.002)\n(0.002)\n5.\nOperating segments\nThe Group has two reportable segments, exploration and corporate, which are the Group's strategic divisions. For each of the strategic divisions, the Group's CEO, deemed to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"\nCODM\n\"), reviews internal management reports on at least a monthly basis. The results are then subsequently shared with the Board.
