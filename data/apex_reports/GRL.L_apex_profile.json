Gold production for the Period totalled\n90.6 kilos of gold\n,\nequivalent to 2,912 troy ounces, all of which was sold during the Period (refined from 113 kilos of dor\u00e9, equivalent to 3,640 ounces). This generated\napproximately US$10 million\nin revenue, at an average realised gold price of approximately\nUS$3,464/oz - compared with a weighted average gold price of approximately US$3,325/oz during the Period.\nTotal material mined during the Period was approximately 744,000 tonnes, including approximately 144,000 tonnes of ore, which is consistent with the reported gold production.\nOperations during the Period were impacted by a combination of increased frequency of regulatory inspections, all of which were dealt with in a professional and satisfactory manner, but nonetheless were time consuming and diverted management focus from routine operational activities, and an unusually heavy rainy season which resulted in three months of heavy rainfall.\nThe heavy rainfall disrupted mining operations and the stacking of agglomerated ore, and average stacked ore volumes reduced from approximately\n36,000 tonnes per month\nto\n14,000 tonnes per month\n. Leach performance was also affected during the Period due to increased solution dilution.\nMining and Processing Plan\nDuring the Period, the Company continued to advance its heap leach and processing infrastructure. A new\nscreening and conveying system was completed and\ncommissioned in\nDecember 2025\n, enabling stacking rates of up to\n56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month\n, providing increased operational flexibility.\nMining in 2026 will continue to focus on near-surface oxide material from the Homase Mine open pit operations. Ore will be sourced primarily from\u00a0Pit 3, which the Company began mining in December 2025, following the completion of the Pit 1 pushback which gave access to\napproximately\n100,000 tonnes of ore\n, which\nwas completed during the Period\n.\nThe mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods, with moderated mining and stacking rates during the wetter months to reduce the impact of rainfall on mining continuity, agglomeration and leach performance. An additional intermediary pond has been included in the FY26 budget to further mitigate solution dilution.\nSubject to permitting, and the further expansion of the heap leach pad area, the Company expects to mine approximately\u00a0250,000 tonnes of ore\u00a0during FY26, at an average mined grade of approximately\u00a01.0 g/t of gold.\nHeap Leach Pad Capacity\nHeap leach operations are dependent on favourable dry-season operating conditions, and are planned at an average stacking rate of approximately\u00a036,000 tonnes per month, with the variations between 14,000 - 56,000 tonnes per month, consistent with historical performance,\nDuring 2026, ore stacking will be supported by the existing leach pads together with\u00a0Pad 6, which is currently under construction and scheduled for geomembrane lining and commissioning in Q1 2026. Pad 6 measures approximately\u00a0160 metres by 120 metres\u00a0and represents the largest leach pad constructed at the Homase mine to date, providing additional stacking flexibility and operational resilience.\nProduction Guidance\nBased on the planned mining and stacking profile, heap leach recovery characteristics of oxide material and the available leach pad capacity, the Company is targeting total gold production of approximately 4,000 ounces of gold in FY26.\nThis guidance assumes average metallurgical recoveries of approximately 68%, in line with historical oxide performance and normal seasonal variability.\nFinancial Performance and Guidance\nGoldStone has been\nself-funding since January 2023\nand, during the Period, reduced its historical balance sheet liabilities by settling approximately\nUS$2.5 million of historical creditor balances\n.\nThe Company achieved an average\nAll-In Sustaining Cost (\"AISC\") of US$2,781 per ounce\nfor the year to November 2025.\nFor FY26, AISC is expected to be approximately US$2,500 - US$2,900 per ounce reflecting:\n\u00b7\nIncreased stacking and leach pad capacity\n\u00b7\nImproved equipment utilisation\n\u00b7\nOngoing cost discipline\n\u00b7\nSeasonal rainfall adjustments\nCapital Expenditure\nCapital expenditure in respect of the Homase Mine during FY26 is expected to be limited and largely restricted to:\n\u00b7\nCompletion and commissioning of Pad 6\n\u00b7\nExpansion of the adsorption plant\n\u00b7\nConstruction of an intermediary pond to enhance recovery\n\u00b7\nRoutine maintenance capital for mining and processing equipment\nCommunity Engagement\nThe Mine Clinic, completed during the Period, is now fully operational and open to local communities. In addition, construction has commenced on a new\ncommunity centre in Krodua village\n, reinforcing the Company's ongoing commitment to local development and stakeholder engagement.\nBoard Changes\nAs announced on 22 December 2025, the Company appointed\ntwo new directors\nto the Board. These appointments are intended to strengthen the Board's collective experience and support GoldStone as it advances its operational and corporate objectives.\nOutlook\nDespite operational challenges experienced during the Period, the Board believes that the Homase Mine is well positioned to deliver improved operational consistency in 2026. With mining access established, enhanced heap leach infrastructure in place and disciplined planning around seasonal conditions, the Company remains focused on maximising cash generation, strengthening its financial position. This was supported by\nAsian Investment Management Services Ltd\nextending the Gold Loan maturity date to 31 December 2026 and the\ninterest payments being\u00a0frozen to 30 June 2026\n, as announced on 30 December 2025, which will help the Company in continuing to develop its resource base to deliver long-term value for shareholders.\nEmma Priestley, Chief Executive Officer of GoldStone Resources Limited, commented:\n\"The past year has seen steady operational progress at our Ghanaian operation. While we faced challenges from numerous regulatory inspections and unusually heavy rainfall, resulting in operational disruptions, the team has continued to advance key infrastructure and improved the Company's financial position with the added support from our major shareholder\nAsian Investment Management Services Ltd\n.\n\"With the strengthening of the Board, the Company is well placed to continue focusing on operational stability and incremental improvements as we move into the next phase of development.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

Gold production for the Period totalled\n90.6 kilos of gold\n,\nequivalent to 2,912 troy ounces, all of which was sold during the Period (refined from 113 kilos of dor\u00e9, equivalent to 3,640 ounces). This generated\napproximately US$10 million\nin revenue, at an average realised gold price of approximately\nUS$3,464/oz - compared with a weighted average gold price of approximately US$3,325/oz during the Period.\nTotal material mined during the Period was approximately 744,000 tonnes, including approximately 144,000 tonnes of ore, which is consistent with the reported gold production.\nOperations during the Period were impacted by a combination of increased frequency of regulatory inspections, all of which were dealt with in a professional and satisfactory manner, but nonetheless were time consuming and diverted management focus from routine operational activities, and an unusually heavy rainy season which resulted in three months of heavy rainfall.\nThe heavy rainfall disrupted mining operations and the stacking of agglomerated ore, and average stacked ore volumes reduced from approximately\n36,000 tonnes per month\nto\n14,000 tonnes per month\n. Leach performance was also affected during the Period due to increased solution dilution.\nMining and Processing Plan\nDuring the Period, the Company continued to advance its heap leach and processing infrastructure. A new\nscreening and conveying system was completed and\ncommissioned in\nDecember 2025\n, enabling stacking rates of up to\n56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month\n, providing increased operational flexibility.\nMining in 2026 will continue to focus on near-surface oxide material from the Homase Mine open pit operations. Ore will be sourced primarily from\u00a0Pit 3, which the Company began mining in December 2025, following the completion of the Pit 1 pushback which gave access to\napproximately\n100,000 tonnes of ore\n, which\nwas completed during the Period\n.\nThe mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods, with moderated mining and stacking rates during the wetter months to reduce the impact of rainfall on mining continuity, agglomeration and leach performance. An additional intermediary pond has been included in the FY26 budget to further mitigate solution dilution.\nSubject to permitting, and the further expansion of the heap leach pad area, the Company expects to mine approximately\u00a0250,000 tonnes of ore\u00a0during FY26, at an average mined grade of approximately\u00a01.0 g/t of gold.\nHeap Leach Pad Capacity\nHeap leach operations are dependent on favourable dry-season operating conditions, and are planned at an average stacking rate of approximately\u00a036,000 tonnes per month, with the variations between 14,000 - 56,000 tonnes per month, consistent with historical performance,\nDuring 2026, ore stacking will be supported by the existing leach pads together with\u00a0Pad 6, which is currently under construction and scheduled for geomembrane lining and commissioning in Q1 2026. Pad 6 measures approximately\u00a0160 metres by 120 metres\u00a0and represents the largest leach pad constructed at the Homase mine to date, providing additional stacking flexibility and operational resilience.\nProduction Guidance\nBased on the planned mining and stacking profile, heap leach recovery characteristics of oxide material and the available leach pad capacity, the Company is targeting total gold production of approximately 4,000 ounces of gold in FY26.\nThis guidance assumes average metallurgical recoveries of approximately 68%, in line with historical oxide performance and normal seasonal variability.\nFinancial Performance and Guidance\nGoldStone has been\nself-funding since January 2023\nand, during the Period, reduced its historical balance sheet liabilities by settling approximately\nUS$2.5 million of historical creditor balances\n.\nThe Company achieved an average\nAll-In Sustaining Cost (\"AISC\") of US$2,781 per ounce\nfor the year to November 2025.\nFor FY26, AISC is expected to be approximately US$2,500 - US$2,900 per ounce reflecting:\n\u00b7\nIncreased stacking and leach pad capacity\n\u00b7\nImproved equipment utilisation\n\u00b7\nOngoing cost discipline\n\u00b7\nSeasonal rainfall adjustments\nCapital Expenditure\nCapital expenditure in respect of the Homase Mine during FY26 is expected to be limited and largely restricted to:\n\u00b7\nCompletion and commissioning of Pad 6\n\u00b7\nExpansion of the adsorption plant\n\u00b7\nConstruction of an intermediary pond to enhance recovery\n\u00b7\nRoutine maintenance capital for mining and processing equipment\nCommunity Engagement\nThe Mine Clinic, completed",

Whilst the past 6 and 12 months have presented challenges for the board and management, I feel tremendous pride when I look at what has been achieved in recent months at Homase, and the continued promise of what can be delivered at both the Homase open pit and the Akrokeri underground mine in the longer term.\nPost-period, the Board has seen a change in leadership with Angela List stepping down and Campbell Smyth assuming the role of Interim Chairman. We thank Angela for her efforts during her time as Chair, and welcome Campbell to his expanded role as we continue to execute our strategy.\nGold production continued to progress during the period. As announced on 2 September 2025, the Company poured 11.06 kilograms (approximately 355.6 ounces) of gold dor\u00e9, underlining our ability to maintain steady production as we optimise our operations.\nExpansion of our heap leach facilities also continues to move forward with the engineering design is complete, the construction permit pending, and the Company have ordered and paid for the geotextile and geomembrane liner, with delivery anticipated by the end of the month. This expansion will provide the additional capacity needed to support sustained growth throughout the remaining months of 2025 and into 2026.\nOperationally, our focus remains on delivering 48,000 tonnes of agglomerated stacked ore per month. Together with the recommencement of mining at Pit 1, maintaining an average grade of 1 g/t, this strategy is expected to support our production profile through the remainder of 2025.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in the fundamentals of our assets and our ability to execute our growth plans. We thank our employees and partners for their hard work and commitment, and our shareholders for their continued support as we move through this growth and ramp up phase.\nEmma K Priestley\nChief Executive Officer\n29 September 2025\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.goldstoneresources.com\nor contact\n:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

I am pleased to report that the efforts of the entire team are bearing fruit and that we remain confident and enthusiastic about the Group's ability to transition into a profitable mining company.\nFollowing a challenging start to 2024, our production profile at the Homase Gold Project in the Ashanti Region of Ghana improved considerably during the final quarter of the year. This positive momentum has continued into 2025, with consistent and improving production levels that reflect the changes implemented at site. This includes enhancements in equipment and processes that are now delivering measurable results in both output and recovery rates.\nOn the corporate side, the Group has taken important steps to strengthen its financial position and improve its balance sheet, reducing financial pressure and ensuring that GoldStone is positioned strongly, as gold production continues to ramp up throughout 2025 and into 2026. The standstill agreement with Asian Investment Management Services Limited (\"AIMSL\") remains in place, with the repayment now deferred to the end of 2025. This will allow the Group to focus on further operational improvements and strategic planning.\nThe operational team at Homase has demonstrated exceptional commitment and resilience, driving the\nturnaround in performance on the ground. As we continue through 2025, our priority remains to build on this progress, both in terms of production and efficiency, while assessing the most viable methods for further unlocking value from the Homase and Akrokeri licence areas.\nThe strength of the gold market continues to underpin this strategic direction. In 2024 and into 2025, gold prices remained robust, driven by persistent global macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and continued investor appetite for safe-haven assets. This favourable price environment enhances the value of each incremental improvement we make at both Homase and Akrokeri and supports our efforts to generate sustainable cash flow. With our low-cost, scalable production model and improving operational performance, GoldStone is well positioned to capitalise on the current market dynamics. As we continue to de-risk operations and improve efficiency, we believe we are strongly placed to benefit from the upside of a resilient gold price and to deliver long-term value to shareholders.\nAs Chair, I remain encouraged by the collaborative spirit and technical focus across the Group. Our management team, both in Ghana and at the corporate level, has shown commendable tenacity and professionalism. I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of our shareholders, whose support and patience have allowed us to navigate through a difficult period and emerge stronger.\nWith Homase in production, exploration upside, and a clear pathway to scaling operations, we believe that 2025 will be an important year for GoldStone. We look forward to updating the market on our continued progress.\nAngela List\nNon-Executive Chair\nChief Executive Officer's REPORT\n2024 has been a year of steady operational improvement and important corporate progress for GoldStone. Our primary focus remained the continued optimisation of production at the Homase Open Pit Mine in Ghana, while also working to strengthen the Group's financial and governance framework. I am pleased to report that the steps that we have taken are yielding tangible results.\nProduction at Homase improved significantly in the second half of 2024 and this upward trend has continued into 2025. We have seen consistent growth in throughput and gold production, following the introduction of enhanced equipment and a more robust plant configuration. This performance marks a critical shift towards our longer-term objective of achieving stable, profitable gold output and site-level cashflow.\nDuring 2024, the Group focused heavily",

With effect from Admission, this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nOn Admission,\nceteris paribus\n, AIMSL will hold 243,803,680 Ordinary Shares in the Company representing approximately 25.7% per cent. of the Company's issued share capital.\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

Lower-than-expected ore grades in the final stages of the Pit 2 of operations, which is nearing the limits of the oxide ore, are currently impacting final gold production volumes, however operations will shortly be re-entering the higher grade Pit 1, which was placed on hold in 2023 due to the now completed relocation of a stream. As such, mining operations will re-commence in Pit 1 within a month, where expected grades are 1-1.2 g/t, which with increased stacking and the continued improvement in leach kinetic rates is expected to facilitate the achievement of our production target over the coming months.\n\u00b7\nExpansion in Progress:\nOperations are currently advancing on the second lift of pads 3 and 4, the extension to Cell 5 is nearing completion. The civil engineering work is underway for the construction of Cells 6 and 7. This work will support the expansion of both mining and processing operations throughout 2025, and preparatory work has already commenced for the expansion of Pit 1.\nEmma Priestley, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"We have seen significant recent operational improvement and now have the key building blocks in place to continue this momentum throughout 2025. We continue to work towards our target of 1,000 ounces of dor\u00e9 per month and believe the progress we've made in recent weeks demonstrates our ability to meet this goal.\"\nFigure 1: Poured Dor\u00e9 16.3 kilos\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

While 2023 brought its challenges, particularly in meeting production targets, we have emerged in 2024 in a much stronger position. This recovery has been supported by the deferral of our secured gold loan repayment to December 2025 and a successful fundraising initiative.\nAt the producing Homase Mine, significant infrastructure upgrades have been implemented, enhancing the mine's long-term capacity. Accordingly, I am pleased to report that H1 2024, we produced 1,333.81 ounces of gold (2023: 124.80). Post period end, the Company has continued to produce approximately 250 troy ounces per month, with latest full month production in August 2024 being 236 ounces of dor\u00e9.\nOur optimisation strategy at Homase continues to progress well as we look to deliver 48,000 tonnes of stacked and agglomerated ore by the end of the year. The Company is currently stacking some 150tph on a single 12 hour shift , and towards the end of 2024, will be running two shifts, for a 24 hour operation, as we build up to 48,000 tpcm, which is expected to facilitate production of approximately 1,000 oz dor\u00e9 per month from the beginning of 2025, based on the current recovery rate of 68% and at a stacked grade of 1g/t.\nThe strategy also includes the development of additional heap leach pads, which are on track and within budget; Pad 5 was completed post period end, and earthworks for Pads 6 and 7 are underway.\nA key pillar of the Company's strategy is to add additional gold resources to our portfolio. In line with this, we will continue exploration efforts along the Homase Trend, that will include core infill drilling to explore the deeper ore zones of Homase, and further explore the parallel zones that have been identified within the mining lease as announced on 8 July 2024. The Company does plan for further exploration programmes within the prospecting licences of Akrokeri and Homase, which enclose the Homase Mine, that includes the recent consolidation and review of all the historical data, at the former Akrokeri Underground Mine and its surrounding areas and develop other underexplored areas that hold potential for further mineral discoveries.\nDuring the period, Bill Trew stepped down from the Board and Campbell Smyth has joined as a Non-Executive Director. Campbell brings over 30 years of experience in fund management, capital markets, and corporate finance, particularly within the venture capital and resource sectors.\nLooking ahead, we are optimistic about GoldStone's growth prospects in the years to come as we improve both production and exploration at the Akrokeri-Homase project and unlock its full potential. Notably, our production ramp-up aligns with a gold market that continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience and strength, supported by diverse factors driving its long-term success.\nThe Board would like to thank shareholders for their continued support as we work towards fully realising the value of our assets and delivering long-term shareholder returns.\nEmma K Priestley\nChief Executive Officer\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.goldstoneresources.com\nor contact\n:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

Despite the many challenges associated with the Company's ordinary shares being suspended from trading for such a long period of time, the Board and management team have remained committed to building value for our Shareholders and are now pleased that the upgraded plant is delivering the improved heap-leaching gold recoveries we targeted.\n\"\nImportantly, the capital-expenditure requirements to increase gold production are relatively minimal henceforth, merely requiring completion of leach pads 5, 6, and 7 and construction of an additional pond. These works will allow the Company to further realise the considerable potential of the Homase Mine's oxide resource base, with the key objective of increasing monthly gold production to 1,000 ounces within six months and achieving [increased operating] cash flow through optimising unit costs and decreasing G&A exposure.\n\"\nI would like to thank the Board and the Company's advisers for their support and to the management team in Ghana for maintaining the mining operations in good order - and especially the Shareholders for their patience as we focused on improving the gold recoveries and ensuring a long-life mining operation.\n\"\nHomase Gold Project - Production\nIn 2023, the Company elected to suspend mining in order to evaluate processing options. This was facilitated by the \u00a32.4 million investment, announced on 27 January 2023, which enabled engineering improvements and further test work to be undertaken.\nAs announced by the Company on 31 May 2023, the Company's process plant on site was extensively upgraded during 2023, with the acquisition of vibrating screens, improved cement feed, and the introduction of a radial stacker, resulting in a significant increase in gold recovery rate to 68% demonstrated over the past two months (2022 average of 34%). The Company is now on track to start increasing production to deliver the planned 50,000 tonnes of stacked and agglomerated ore within six months, and this level is expected to be maintained on a monthly basis to ensure that gold-production targets of 1,000oz pcm can be achieved.\nThe Company has now hired a 50-tonne excavator and three 45-tonne ADT trucks (Figure 2), which will allow a substantial increase in production from Homase's Pit 2, which is yielding an average grade of 1.1g/t.\nOn the heap leach pads, the Company has levelled and compacted Pads 1, 2 and 3 in readiness for the second lift - superimposition of the next layer of ore for leaching. Pad 4 is nearing completion, Pad 5 is being constructed, and civil engineering has begun for Pads 6 and 7.\nAnother important achievement in 2023 was the commissioning of the on-site laboratory, allowing the Company to undertake continuous Column Leach test work and Fire Assays, with the appropriate microbalances and an Atomic Absorption machine to ensure accurate analysis. This facility now enables better grade control, critical for both mining and processing.\nDespite limited cash resources during 2023 and H1 2024, the Company remained focused on resuming mining and increasing production, and with the equity raise announced on 24 May 2024, the Company was able to return to trading and the Board now look forward to progressing operations.\nFigure 1.

The Company's Laboratory with the Muffle Furnace and Column Leach Test Work\nContinued Desk Review for Exploration\nThroughout 2023 and in H1 2024, the Company continued to review historical exploration datasets for the Homase mine and its extended mineralised trend, as described in the Company's announcement on 20 June 2018, that extends north-east ",

The existing resource is confined to a 4km zone of the Homase Trend, including Homase North, Homase Pit and Homase South.\nThe project hosts two former mines, the Akrokerri Ashanti Mine Ltd, which produced 75,000 oz gold at 24 g/t recovered grade in the early 1900s, and the Homase Pit which AngloGold Ashanti developed in 2002/03 producing 52,000 oz gold at 2.5 g/t recovered. Production is currently focussed on the Homase Mine however it is the Company's intention to build a portfolio of high-quality gold projects in Ghana, with a particular focus on the highly prospective Ashanti Gold Belt.\nCHAIR'S REPORT\nThe team has had a dual focus during 2023; firstly to improve operational performance at our first mining operation, the Homase Gold Project in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, and secondly to advance the corporate activities of the Company in order to resume trading of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the AIM market of the London stock exchange. 2023 was undoubtedly challenging for the whole team, however as at the time of writing, the business is now back on an even keel, and we are excited and enthusiastic about GoldStone's future.\nThe Company announced in January 2023 that it had raised \u00a32,400,000 via the\nissue of a convertible loan note and used the proceeds to\ninvest in the necessary equipment and infrastructure to improve the long-term production profile of the Homase Mine. E\nquipment was bought, and the plant was modified to increase the gold recovery factor to an average of 60-70%.\nMining and stacking recommenced in June 2023, with approximately 1,257oz produced in 2023, and production and stacking is expected to increase throughout 2024 which will in turn increase the gold production and sales. At the time of writing, a total of 1,350oz has been produced from the Homase Mine in 2024, and the Board is confident that this production, combined with the Company's recent fundraising activities, will support production at this rate over the months to come.\nDespite the hard work and perseverance of the team during 2023, we did not reach our production target for 2023. Today, approximately 810 ounces are estimated by management, remaining within the heap,\nclassed as Gold in Process (\"GIP\"), but there will be limited recovery from this GIP gold until an alternative process method is introduced, which the Company is reviewing.\nAs Shareholders will be aware in November 2023, the Company's secured gold loan from Asian Investment Management Services Limited (\"AIMSL\") was due for repayment. Post period end, in January 2024 the Company agreed\na standstill arrangement with AIMSL which, following a further amendment, has deferred repayment until 31 December 2025. This has been an important development for GoldStone, and one which prompted a corporate restructure, including the appointment of myself as Chair of the Board and the appointment of Campbell Smyth, who represents the AIMSL shareholder. This also prompted the recruitment of a new operational team at Homase, which the Nguvu Mining Ltd has aided and assisted in. I see this as a new dawn for GoldStone and, speaking on behalf of the Board, we are all extremely eager to ramp up production and, subject to availability of capital, conduct further exploration drilling to begin to unlock the true value of the Homase and Akrokeri Projects.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the GoldStone management team, some of whom have been working in difficult conditions for many months at a time; their dedication and commitment to making a success of this project is commendable. I would also like to thank my predecessor, Bill Trew, for his contributions to the Company, who stood down from the Board of Directors on 1 April 2024. A",

The Company has, to date, received \u00a3634,000 in funds due pursuant to the Subscription. Asian Investment Services Limited (\"\nAIMSL\n\"), a substantial shareholder in the Company and the provider of the Gold Loan, has agreed to subscribe for \u00a3200,000 of Subscription Shares for cash pursuant to the Subscription (the \"\nAIMSL\nSubscription\n\") to provide total gross proceeds of \u00a3834,000 (the \"\nFundraise\n\"). The Board believes that the Fundraise, in conjunction with the Group's ongoing revenues and creditor arrangements, provides sufficient working capital for continued operations, and accordingly intends to close the Fundraise on receipt of funds from AIMSL, expected by Thursday, 23 May 2024, subject to which Admission is expected to take place on 24 May 2024.\nThe Company notes that it has produced 1,153oz, averaging 230 oz of gold per month, from the Homase Mime in 2024 to date, and the Board believes the Fundraise provides sufficient working capital to continue production at at least this rate over the coming months. The Company may, in due course, seek to raise additional capital to support increasing its rate of production, to support additional exploration activities to increase the Company's resource base and to reduce creditors.\nThe Company will provide a further update on receipt of funds from AIMSL with respect to timing for Admission, resultant total voting rights, and restoration of the Company's Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM.\nAIMSL Subscription and Related Party Transaction\nThe Company notes that, in conjunction with the AIMSL Subscription, the number of shares to be issued on Admission pursuant to the conversion of interest accrued on the Gold Loan pursuant to the Amendment Agreement will be reduced to 52,800,000 Conversion Shares, representing approximately 300 oz of the 578.4 oz of gold interest accrued on the Gold Loan to 31 December 2023. This is in order to ensure AIMSL's interest in the Company remains below 30% of the Company's issued share capital on Admission. The balance of the Conversion Shares will be issued to AIMSL in due course on the same terms at such time as this can be achieved without increasing AIMSL's interest in the Company's Ordinary Shares above 30%.\nIt is also noted the AIMS intends to appoint a nominee Non-Executive Director to the Board of the Company in due course, as it is entitled to do pursuant to the Gold Loan agreement.\nAIMSL, currently holds 122,000,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company. Accordingly, the AIMSL Subscription, as detailed above, constitutes a related party transaction pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The Board of Goldstone considers, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Strand Hanson Limited, that the terms and conditions of the AIMSL Subscription are fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of the Company are concerned.\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nEmma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

Therefore, it quickly became apparent that significant optimisation work was required in order to enhance recoveries due to agglomeration issues.\nTo undertake this, further investment was required and a\nconvertible loan note was entered into on 27 January 2023 with Blue Gold International Limited (\"\nBGL\n\") in the nominal amount of \u00a32,400,000 (the \"\nLoan Notes\n\") which is due for redemption on 30 November 2024. At the election of BGL, the Loan Notes (together with accrued interest to date) may be converted (in whole or in part) at any time prior to redemption into new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary\nShares\n\") at a conversion price of \u00a30.0325 per share. BGL has also received warrants to subscribe for up to 60,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of \u00a30.04 per share exercisable at any time until 26 January 2025.\nThe proceeds from the Loan Notes contributed towards the purchase of plant and equipment, including a radial stacker, to assist in reducing the operating costs of the operation, increase production, and improve the recovery rate of the heap leach operation, which during 2022 yielded 65% of the contained gold delivered to the heap.\nThe team immediately commenced detailed test work and cost analysis to further understand the leach kinetics in order to optimise the recovery of the remaining contained gold in the heap. This work informed the reconfiguration of the agglomeration and crushing circuit to handle the excess clay encountered and the greater than expected amount of silt originating from the oxide orebody's fragile phyllitic content. A modified screening system has been designed and built to control the feed sizing, which has allowed for the oversize >80mm to be removed from the circuit thus allowing for more consistency within the agglomeration drum.\nThis work programme improved recoveries from the heap leach operation, however our ability to regain some lost ground from our initial production target has been further frustrated by a very extreme and prolonged rainy season, which significantly curtailed stacking from June to October 2023. Production for the year to 31 December 2023 was 95,497 tonnes of ore, agglomerated and stacked, averaging 1g/t Au with 1,275.25 oz of gold bullion sold at an average price USD1,969.82/oz. This was a disappointing result for us, however, the practical and learned experiences should ensure that our production trajectory improves going forward.\nAs shareholders will be aware, the current available mineable resource from the first pit within the Homase Mine was estimated by management to be 304,000 tonnes @ 1.7g/t of oxide ore. From the second pit, it is estimated by management that there is 640,000 tonnes @ 1.1g/t of oxide ore, which was derived from the update regarding the mineable resource announced on 12 November 2020. The mineable resource is within the confines of the 602,000oz JORC (2012) resource previously announced.\nExploration\nThe Akrokeri Licence is a primary exploration focus of our geological team, and they are working tirelessly with the aim of adding a significant deposit to GoldStone. The exploration centred on the former Akrokeri Underground Mine and along strike from it. During the period and post period end, our operational team continue with the reassessment of the former mine workings and artisanal mine workings, building the database with historical exploration work and consolidating historical geological reports that reference not just the Akrokeri Mine but also other historical exploration targets in the vicinity of the Akrokeri Mine.\nThe main ore body at Akrokeri is a lenticular quartz-carbonate vein, in places with parallels, within a substantial mineralized structural corridor, trending north and dipping to the west at about 70\u00b0. It lies on the eastern contact of a massive granitoid within Birimian-age meta-sedimentary units, predominantly phyllites that dip steeply north-west. The contained gold mineralisation occurs as coarse visible gold and is also associated with pyrite, arsenopyrite, and galena in the vein-quartz and in altered wallrocks.\nIn August 2022, we commenced a Diamond Drilling programme at Akrokeri to advance ",

The existing resource is confined to a 4km zone of the Homase Trend, including Homase North, Homase Pit and Homase South.\nThe project hosts two former mines, the Akrokerri Ashanti Mine Ltd, which produced 75,000 oz gold at 24 g/t recovered grade in the early 1900s, and the Homase Pit which AngloGold Ashanti developed in 2002/03 producing 52,000 oz gold at 2.5 g/t recovered. Production is currently focussed on the Homase Mine however it is the Company's intention to build a portfolio of high-quality gold projects in Ghana, with a particular focus on the highly prospective Ashanti Gold Belt.\nCHAIR'S REPORT\nIt gives me great pleasure to present my first statement as Chair of GoldStone, having assumed the position in January 2024. I join as Chair at a pivotal time for GoldStone, as we look to solidify and extend our position as an emerging gold producer focussed on the famously productive Ashanti Gold Belt in Ghana. 2022 was a year of significant progress for GoldStone, with the commencement of commercial gold production, but also a year of challenge as we looked to remedy a number of technical issues in order to optimise production and move towards profitability. As shareholders will be aware, the publication of this report is now over nine months past our intended release date and so it is appropriate to also comment on the post period developments for the Company. As such, 2023 could be defined as year of reflection and innovation as we looked to address the stubborn agglomeration issues that we have experienced since operations commenced at our initial production asset, the Homase Mine in southwest Ghana.\nDuring the year under review, GoldStone produced and sold 5,155 troy ounces of gold from Homase, realising an average price of US$1,727 per troy ounce for revenues of US$8.9m. From this gold production, gold loan repayments were made via the delivery of 675 troy ounces to Asia Investments Management Services Limited (\"AIMSL\").\nAs shareholders will be aware, this production figure would have been higher were it not for the estimated 192 troy ounces of gold, amounting to some US$350,000, that was stolen in a robbery, as announced on 29 June 2022. This was a serious incident for GoldStone, and one which highlighted various areas for improvement in terms of our security solution in-country. Investigations relating to the robbery are on-going, with the target of pursuing charges on those responsible, and all necessary changes have been made to our contract security to ensure that the highest levels of safety and security are enforced.\nWe were disappointed not to reach our 2022 production target of 7,000 troy ounces of gold, with the known complications of the heap leach operation which led to this shortfall, there are some 2,000 ounces remaining within the heap,\nclassed as GIP (Gold in Process), but there will be limited recovery from this GIP gold until a new process method is introduced.\nAs referred to previously, GoldStone has been working to ameliorate some persistent agglomeration issues, which, together with inclement weather during H2 2022, negatively impacted gold recovery rates and affected the stacking of the material. The Company continues to test and assess agglomeration methods to resolve and improve recovery factor.\nGiven the lower than forecast production for the year, the Board were mindful of the importance of preserving cash within the business for working capital purposes. Accordingly, during the year, certain directors agreed to convert US$239,250 of outstanding fees, accrued and unpaid to 30 June 2022, into equity. The Board's continued, and indeed, increased alignment with shareholders, is a clear signal of both their commitment t",

Participants in the Subscription will also receive, for each Subscription Share, one warrant over a further new Ordinary Share exercisable at a price of 2 pence per share for 24 months from the date of issue (the \"\nWarrants\n\").\nIn addition, the Company has entered into an agreement (the \"\nAmendment Agreement\n\") with Asian Investment Management Services Limited (\"\nAIMSL\n\") to extend to 31 December 2025 the standstill period in the Standstill Agreement dated 29 December 2023 relating to the exercise of certain of AIMSL's rights under the gold loan agreement entered into with the Company on 19 June 2020 (\"\nGold Loan Agreement\n\"). Pursuant to the Amendment Agreement, AIMSL has also agreed to accept settlement of the interest accrued under the Gold Loan Agreement to 31 December 2023 by the issue to AIMSL of 101,803,680 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nConversion Shares\n\"). Following and subject to issue of the Conversion Shares, the outstanding balance in respect of the Gold Loan and accrued interest will be reduced to the principal of 1,871.43 troy ounces and will accrue interest at 14% from 1 January 2024.\nThe Subscription Shares and Conversion Shares represent approximately 23% and 13% respectively of the Company's share capital as enlarged by the issue of the Subscription Shares and the Conversion Shares.\nThe Subscription Price of 1 penny represents a discount of approximately 53% to the mid-market closing price on AIM of 2.15 pence per Ordinary Share on 30 June 2023, being the latest trading day prior to suspension of the Company's Ordinary Shares from trading on AIM.\nThe issue of the Subscription Shares, the Warrants and the Conversion Shares will be conditional,\ninter alia\n, on the Company obtaining the requisite shareholder approvals in respect of the issue of such shares from its\u00a0shareholders\u00a0at the Company's forthcoming annual general meeting to be convened shortly (the \"\nAGM\n\").\nThe net proceeds of the Subscription will be used to partially settle the Company's overdue creditor balances in line with payment plans agreed with the Company's major creditors, to progress the Company's strategy of developing and improving production at its Homase Mine in Ghana and for general working capital purposes.\nIt is noted that, in the event the resolutions related to the Subscription (the \"Resolutions\") are not passed at the AGM, the Board would, in light of the Company's significant overdue creditor balances, likely have to file insolvency of the Company under Jersey Law. Accordingly, the Board strongly encourages all shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM.\nDirectors' Anticipated Participation\nIt is noted that certain of the Company's directors and a senior employee also intend to convert certain outstanding cash fees on the same terms as the Subscription, following publication of the Company's Annual Report and Accounts in respect of the year to 31 December 2022 and interim results for the 6 months to 30 June 2023 (the \"\nAccounts\n\"), expected later today (the \"\nDirector\nSubscription\n\").\nRecommendation and Irrevocable Undertakings\nThe Board intends to recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions at the AGM and each director intends to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of the shareholdings owned or controlled by them.\nIt is also noted that the Company has received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the AGM from Paracale Gold Limited and AIMSL in respect of their holdings of, in aggregate, 247,656,575 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 49.7% or the Company's currently issued share capital.\nRelated Party Transaction\nEntering into the Amendment Agreement (including the agreement to accept the Conversion Shares in settlement of accrued interest) with AIMSL, as a substantial shareholder of the Company, is deemed to constitute a related party transaction under the AIM Rules for Companies. Having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Strand Hanson Limited, the directors consider the terms of such arrangement to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nCircular and Notice of AGM\nA circular relating,\ninter alia\n, to the Subscription (the \"\nCircular\n\") will be posted to shareholders shortly and will be made available to",

The Board is in discussions with its Secured Creditor and, until those discussions have been concluded, the Company's auditors are not in a position to finalise their audit opinion in respect of the Company's final results for the 12 months to 31 December 2022 (the \"\n2022 Accounts\n\") and thus sign off on the 2022 Accounts. The Company will therefore not be able to publish its accounts in advance of a suitable solution being reached.\nWhilst the Board is in active discussions with stakeholders to achieve an appropriate solution with respect to the Gold Loan and the provision of additional working capital for the Company, there can be no guarantee that such an agreement can be reached or additional working capital provided. The Board is taking appropriate professional advice, but in the event that a solution cannot be achieved and the outstanding principal amount of the Gold Loan and accrued interest thereon (which as of 30 September 2023 amounted to, in aggregate, 2,354 ounces of gold) cannot be repaid or rescheduled prior to 10 November 2023, security over the Company's primary assets could potentially be enforced.\nThe Company's Ordinary Shares will remain suspended from trading on AIM until such time as it has satisfied the requirements of AIM Rule 19 with respect to publication of its 2022 Accounts and AIM Rule 18 with regard to publication of its interim results for the six-month period to 30 June 2023, which were required to be published by 30 September 2023.

As at 30 September 2023, the Company's consolidated unaudited cash position was approximately $0.2m, with consolidated total liabilities estimated at $10.7m, comprising $7.8m of current liabilities (including $4.4m in relation to the Gold Loan referred to above) and the convertible loan note issued to Blue Gold International Limited in January 2023 (approximately $2.9m).\nThe Company will provide a further update(s) in due course as appropriate.\nUnless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms in this announcement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Company's announcements of 2 October 2023.\n- ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nGoldStone Resources Limited\nBill Trew / Emma Priestley\nTel: +44 (0)1534 487 757\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Dance / James Bellman\nTel: +44 (0)20 7409 3494\nS.

No binding agreements have been made yet, and the Company will provide further updates if any such agreements are finalised.\nInterest Conversion - Gold Loan\nThe Company also announces that\u00a0Asian Investment Management Services Limited (\"AIMS\")\u00a0has agreed to accept settlement of approximately\u00a0\u00a31.45 million\u00a0of accrued interest under the gold loan agreement with AIMS, entered into on 19 June 2020 (the \"Gold Loan\") by way of conversion into equity, at an agreed conversion price of\u00a0USD4,250 per ounce\u00a0and an exchange rate of\u00a0USD:GBP 0.74.\nAccordingly, the Company will issue\u00a0144,855,000 new Ordinary Shares\u00a0at the Subscription Price (the \"Interest Conversion Shares\"). Following Admission, AIMS will represent approximately\u00a029.91 per cent.\u00a0of the Enlarged Share Capital (as defined below). Following the issue of the Interest Conversion Shares, the accrued interest remaining on the Gold Loan will be approximately 250 troy ounces in addition to the principal amount outstanding of 1,871.31 troy ounces.\nRelated Party Transaction\nAs AIMS is a substantial shareholder of the Company, the issue of the Interest Conversion Shares is deemed to constitute a related party transaction under the AIM Rules for Companies. Having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Strand Hanson Limited, all of the Company's independent directors in respect of the Interest Conversion Shares (being all directors save for Campbell Smyth) consider the terms of such arrangement to be fair and reasonable insofar as Shareholders are concerned.\nDirector Fee Conversions\nIn order to preserve cash within the Company for working capital purposes, certain of the Company's directors have agreed to convert, in aggregate,\u00a0USD301,153 (being approximately \u00a3222,853), representing\u00a050% of outstanding directors' fees accrued and unpaid for the period from\u00a01 January 2024 to 31 December 2025, into\u00a022,285,317 new Ordinary Shares\u00a0at the Subscription Price (the \"Fee Conversion Shares\").

The question the changes from that of grade to a question of whether they can get their act together and stack more ore\u2026 I guess this then leads on to a different question. Is the stacked ore low cos leach rates are slower than expected? Or can they just not mine the ore in sufficient quantity?

Lots of things can be right at the same time BTW, they clearly have issues upscalling ore processing and stacking using limited capex and inexperience. But equally, the CEO's communications and PR is appalling, its unforgivable for a CEO of a listed company to disappear from site when you have operational set backs, you need to manage them, the 'ostrich' routine does no one any favours, least of all the SP. One thing is for sure, if we have an improvement in Q1 2026, the microcap here will mean any leak and buying will show up in the SP first and vice versa. That will be the immediate 'tell' for shareholders.",

The conveyor belt system is not covered and the ore will already be soaked as they add the lime/cement which will have a detrimental affect on the chemical reaction to separate the gold from the ore. The rest of the process will also be affected by the moisture content of the agglomeration ore! As you alluded  to before GRL are a very small company with little money for the next step up but that's not to say 2026 will be better than forecast! The last update was more detailed than previous communications albeit not as positive as previous updates but I'd rather they told it as it was along with projections for 2026! Why do you say the CEO disappeared from site?",

That said, you can't update the market every month when things are going well, then every 5 months when you've operational set backs, it's inconsistent, that doesn't foster market confidence. This company needs to 'grow up' on its reporting cycle, big boys and girls in mining Report detailed updates every quarter, let's hope GRL will move to that. And investor can set a calander to that, with a CEO confrence call after it. These things are important. I believe there is a good chance this company succeeds, and I also believe there is a chance the Q1 figures blows by the stated amounts, as my musing yesterday showed, the Ore Body and its understanding of it, looks fine, it appears to be s ground operation and stacking issues, which I also get is CAPEX intensive, who knows, maybe it was a CAPEX issue, not a technical issue that made them slow up on the stacking regimes.

That's great, myself and others predicted more like 1B shares at 0.25p to raise such an amount. The directors have also taken all their wages at 1p and it's not an egregious amount either for publicly limited company directors. And finally another 145m shares at 1p to pay down some of the debt.

If you look back at past RNS\u2019s, I\u2019ve lost count of the times they\u2019ve stated there is expansion going on (some new pit/pad or other supposedly being built) which will \u2018imminently increase production substantially\u2019, only for that never to materialise. It\u2019s still running, which is a big positive, but the old problems of almost zero communication, and clarity, remain. As PI\u2019s we just have no idea what\u2019s really going on. To starve us of production figures shows the contempt the board has for us. We need to know figures, good or bad, and plans to sort those numbers and timeframes if they are bad, and in a truthful format! Let\u2019s hope 2026 finally brings long suffering investors some good news! Anyone know what their PR company does apart from oversee the odd RNS? What sort of serious PR company would put themselves in the firing line for criticism by being associated with GRL?",

That\u2019s been the case from day one.\" That's exactly right and it's up to the individual to assess the degree of risk/reward they are willing to take! GRL even stated in their 'Risk management\" section of the Final Results  \"Development and mining for natural resources is speculative and involves significant risk. \" The Interim Results were only three months ago: Produced 2,917 ounces of gold to the end of August 2025. \u2022     Significant infrastructure upgrades, paid from cashflow, have enhanced long-term capacity. \u2022     Focus on delivering production targets with 48,000 tonnes per month of agglomerated ore delivered to the heap leach pads. \u2022     Gross profits in the period increased by more than 200% versus H1 FY24,  supported by the strong gold price during the period. \u2022     Liabilities reduced with the successful conversion of the Loan Note on 28 January 2025. \u2022     Cambell Smyth, who brings over 30 years of experience in fund management, capital markets, and corporate finance, appointed as Interim Chairman. Yesterday GRL confirmed the \"Gold Loan Standstill Extension\" with Asian Investment Management Services Ltd (\"AIMS\") which was great to hear as a few posters on the BB's were scaremongering with all sorts of scenarios and they have been proved wrong yet again! 2025 has been disappointing in regards not getting near their '1,000 ounces per month target' but they are producing gold in an era of a strong gold market which is set to continue!  I'm looking forward to 2026 and see if GRL can get production up and keep it there but not as a  \"long suffering investor\" but one who knows the risks involved!",

It's also difficulty of execution, they've took over a disused mine, then on a shoestring capex budget, got it into production, and actually have it operationally profitable with the debt leftover to get it there, that achievement puts GRL in the 1% of mine exploration developers, most fail miserably. Yes, to do that and hold on to the majority of the mine, they've had to be economical with the truth, provide truth limited updates to the market to get bondholders exit liquidity early in 2025 for example and everything in between. It's tough to hear these things if you don't understand what you're investing in, but there we are. As they move on to the next chapter of this story, as a producer upping the production numbers, that has to change as the investor profile changes. Updates need to go quarterly, comms needs to improve, the website needs updated regularly, the CEO is done, neither her history here or her skills are survivable and I expect her gone in weeks and replaced. The company needs a 're-write' and that is now obviously in train with the new NED Appointments and Gold Loan Deferment.",

The \u2018bashers\u2019 have essentially lost money and are resigned to it and are trying to warn the \u2018rampers\u2019. The question remains fundamental- why is there so little gold being poured? Can anyone answer that? I\u2019m not bashing I\u2019m asking a question. The answers that I can tell are; - incompetent management? - or are the gold grades not actually good enough? I think that only pit 4 gold is JORC compliant so the grades question is valid\u2026 I thought that the management had taken steps to improve the gold pours; - changed the team working for them, which led to increased the stacking of ore - increased heap leach capacity). So it looked like management were doing a good job. But the gold pours at the end of 2025 are down vs the start. How can this possibly happen when the HL capacity and stacking is higher?? On that basis something is fundamentally not right. It\u2019s not bashing. It\u2019s just a fact. The share price should be multiples of where it is. Given how 2025 progressed you cannot see why there would be any improvement for 2026. AIMSL have extended the loan to allow them (AIMSL) to decide what to do with this asset. In addition we can all agree the price of gold will be higher at then end of this year so are AIMSL taking the longer term view of waiting for a higher price of gold in 2027 before taking the asset and selling it on?\u2026.",

I suggest shareholders should be grateful to AIMs for allowing this entity to remain in a position where it can still mine gold for at least 6 months (but who knows at what cost - as GRL have not provided any operational feedback or even if they are still operating the mine since late September). also \". . I'd expect an update by the end of this month. . .\",  some posters are a little more ambitious for an update - especially considering the failed production targets. May I ask if you be getting very annoyed by February without an update? My thoughts - if GRL was planning to give a production update to SH - it would have happened in December along with some waffle (to be believe or not) about 2026 production figures. As they never - I suspect the only update shall be the mandatory LSE AIM requirements - which I understand next is a statement for 2025 year end. Maybe an event takes place that forces them to make an earlier production statement - such as possible cash raise - as they have stated they need capital (assume to advance in production output). Overall - the quicker SH hear about any further cash investment in production - the more time in 2026 they have to increase production to pay back this farcical gold-loan. But I am sure - any further raise or loan - shall require EP to be a long way from controlling the till (maybe still with GRL - but not a name on the RNS).",

Depending on how many tests they did to arrive at the expected 1 g/t grade could be an issue too!

GRL meeting or realistically  getting no way near to their 'Target' figure has seen the decline in SP through 2025 which was made worse by AGM shenanigans and then the uncertainty over the AIMS issue over the last few months! At the present time GRL haven't updated the market with any production figures since the Interim Results (30th September) but last month they have strengthened the Board with two independent non-executive directors and the AIMS agreement has been re-negotiated! Therefore a lot has happened in a few weeks and now GRL need to show the market at least a steady increase in gold production through 2026 whether that be by monthly or quarterly updates. The SP has already reacted to the recent RNS statements in a positive fashion and I see no reason for that not to continue IF they can achieve said gold production! GRL are in a similar if not improved position to the start of 2025 so exciting times.......possibly/hopefully!",

The question the changes from that of grade to a question of whether they can get their act together and stack more ore\u2026 I guess this then leads on to a different question. Is the stacked ore low cos leach rates are slower than expected? Or can they just not mine the ore in sufficient quantity?

One thing is for sure, if we have an improvement in Q1 2026, the microcap here will mean any leak and buying will show up in the SP first and vice versa.

The rest of the process will also be affected by the moisture content of the agglomeration ore! As you alluded  to before GRL are a very small company with little money for the next step up but that's not to say 2026 will be better than forecast! The last update was more detailed than previous communications albeit not as positive as previous updates but I'd rather they told it as it was along with projections for 2026!

This company needs to 'grow up' on its reporting cycle, big boys and girls in mining Report detailed updates every quarter, let's hope GRL will move to that. And investor can set a calander to that, with a CEO confrence call after it. These things are important. I believe there is a good chance this company succeeds, and I also believe there is a chance the Q1 figures blows by the stated amounts, as my musing yesterday showed, the Ore Body and its understanding of it, looks fine, it appears to be s ground operation and stacking issues, which I also get is CAPEX intensive, who knows, maybe it was a CAPEX issue, not a technical issue that made them slow up on the stacking regimes.

The question the changes from that of grade to a question of whether they can get their act together and stack more ore\u2026 I guess this then leads on to a different question. Is the stacked ore low cos leach rates are slower than expected? Or can they just not mine the ore in sufficient quantity?

One thing is for sure, if we have an improvement in Q1 2026, the microcap here will mean any leak and buying will show up in the SP first and vice versa.

The rest of the process will also be affected by the moisture content of the agglomeration ore! As you alluded  to before GRL are a very small company with little money for the next step up but that's not to say 2026 will be better than forecast! The last update was more detailed than previous communications albeit not as positive as previous updates but I'd rather they told it as it was along with projections for 2026!

This company needs to 'grow up' on its reporting cycle, big boys and girls in mining Report detailed updates every quarter, let's hope GRL will move to that. And investor can set a calander to that, with a CEO confrence call after it. These things are important. I believe there is a good chance this company succeeds, and I also believe there is a chance the Q1 figures blows by the stated amounts, as my musing yesterday showed, the Ore Body and its understanding of it, looks fine, it appears to be s ground operation and stacking issues, which I also get is CAPEX intensive, who knows, maybe it was a CAPEX issue, not a technical issue that made them slow up on the stacking regimes.

The question the changes from that of grade to a question of whether they can get their act together and stack more ore\u2026 I guess this then leads on to a different question. Is the stacked ore low cos leach rates are slower than expected? Or can they just not mine the ore in sufficient quantity? (Or is my memory acting up and they never RNSd that they were stacking 48koz \u2026) In summary (and as usual) better comms are needed to explain what is going on here\u2026",

There was lots of optimise 13 months ago based on wording in previous RNS. Just because production figures are stated to be lower for this year than last year -many posters here actually now believe EP telling truth - but historically - suggest this is difficult. 6 years of krap incorrect information - maybe it shall be 7 years at the end of 2026 - so be cautious of future statements - and only believe production figures which needs to be factual. Production since august/september is non existence - will they provide production figures for January or February  !!? My view - EP's history speaks for itself.",

AIMS / Paracle, and whomever else ponied up this cash obviously think its a good investment, and believe EP is the person to lead it, their information will be better than ours.

I think there\u2019s a real chance of a turnaround now but I haven\u2019t bought back in, I can\u2019t square the fact that the recent interview sounds almost identical to the year before. In parts almost word for word. And not enough explanation has been given as to why production slowed to a crawl in H2, swept under the carpet and so can\u2019t be sure they\u2019ll even hit the ground running with these near $5k gold price. If I end up closing out other positions and this retraces a bit more I\u2019ll maybe take a punt but for now remains on the watchlist - would I be shocked if this eventually ends up at 5p+ ? No, it\u2019s more than possible now so GL to holders :)",

The Company plans to use the remaining funds to invest in gold projects outside Ghana, aiming to diversify its asset base and enhance Shareholder value. It is currently in advanced discussions regarding a potential investment in a company with gold assets in Sierra Leone. No binding agreements have been made yet, and the Company will provide further updates if any such agreements are finalised.\" So not an acquisition. I'd rather have the remaining ploughed into Homase, but I couldn't vote on that, such a shame. Does it mean they think they have enough funds coming in from Homase to continue expansion? I wonder!",

I know you asked boo but I to would expect an improvement in gold production from the next update for a few reasons: 1. It's the dry season now, therefore no delays from rainfall 2.  \"A new screening and conveying system was completed and commissioned in December 2025, enabling stacking rates of up to 56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month, providing increased operational flexibility.\" That's obviously depending on whether it's on-line and working after commissioning! 3. \"The mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods\" 4. With the new board now settled in, by the sounds of it overseeing day to day activities, along with lessons learnt and the experience gained over the last two years or so, should make the whole process more efficient yielding greater gold production..........in theory! :-)",

My opinion is their current operation is basically keeping the lights on while they 'try' to achieve their long term plan ! The board is now stronger, again in my opinion, and with the recent financial boost the company is looking in a far better state for said future growth! Exciting times one way or t'other!",

You'll know after EGM anyway because at 17% they'll have to declare. Paracle have just about too few shares now that 17%+existing shares wouldn't put them over 30% so it's possible. But my bet is it's (really) AIMS, and when the warrant exercise they own 60% and the show. It's tempting as a trade - but I don't trust EP enough :) good luck those that do!",

It was obvious even the stay of execution would get a rerate with any better news a bigger rerate. These are the events traders look for which is why they come in before/after news to try and pump it Instead I put my money elsewhere and I hope it works out - I went asx/psl where they're drilling next to Greatlands plot. Hopefully it works out. I remain very bullish on gold (this is my first gold divestment since GRL debarcle), very bearish on EP here, but as always, I hope you guys win, it sucks to lose, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

There was lots of optimise 13 months ago based on wording in previous RNS. Just because production figures are stated to be lower for this year than last year -many posters here actually now believe EP telling truth - but historically - suggest this is difficult. 6 years of krap incorrect information - maybe it shall be 7 years at the end of 2026 - so be cautious of future statements - and only believe production figures which needs to be factual. Production since august/september is non existence - will they provide production figures for January or February  !!? My view - EP's history speaks for itself.",

AIMS / Paracle, and whomever else ponied up this cash obviously think its a good investment, and believe EP is the person to lead it, their information will be better than ours. If you want my tuppence, I believe we will achieve over 2k ounces production in Q1 this year. Hold me to this statement.",

You have clearly had more experience than me of the ups and downs of Goldstone (having watched them since 2019/2020) as I'm a fairly new investor in this particular share. It does seem a long time to merely be watching a company. As for the script of 'Fawlty Towers' it's probably one of the best ever written!",

I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

If they never allowed the roll-over - then my statement below is an acceptable way forward - as the gold-loan was worth considerably more than the MCAP value of GRL that includes the ownership of Homase licence. Together with the recent knowledge that production since September 2025 is probably less than the amount of gold in a Ratners wedding ring - suggest some look at divine intervention. However - with gold price as it is - and any evidence from GRL that they are actually achieving the low production levels stated recently in RNS - then it is possible for MCAP to get to \u00a325m+ if gold price shows stability.",

I know you asked boo but I to would expect an improvement in gold production from the next update for a few reasons: 1. It's the dry season now, therefore no delays from rainfall 2.  \"A new screening and conveying system was completed and commissioned in December 2025, enabling stacking rates of up to 56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month, providing increased operational flexibility.\" That's obviously depending on whether it's on-line and working after commissioning! 3. \"The mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods\" 4. With the new board now settled in, by the sounds of it overseeing day to day activities, along with lessons learnt and the experience gained over the last two years or so, should make the whole process more efficient yielding greater gold production..........in theory! :-)",

My opinion is their current operation is basically keeping the lights on while they 'try' to achieve their long term plan ! The board is now stronger, again in my opinion, and with the recent financial boost the company is looking in a far better state for said future growth! Exciting times one way or t'other!",

You'll know after EGM anyway because at 17% they'll have to declare. Paracle have just about too few shares now that 17%+existing shares wouldn't put them over 30% so it's possible. But my bet is it's (really) AIMS, and when the warrant exercise they own 60% and the show. It's tempting as a trade - but I don't trust EP enough :) good luck those that do!",

It was priced to fail. I would only have put a small amount in and, being not a trader, in the end didn't. It was obvious even the stay of execution would get a rerate with any better news a bigger rerate. These are the events traders look for which is why they come in before/after news to try and pump it Instead I put my money elsewhere and I hope it works out - I went asx/psl where they're drilling next to Greatlands plot. Hopefully it works out. I remain very bullish on gold (this is my first gold divestment since GRL debarcle), very bearish on EP here, but as always, I hope you guys win, it sucks to lose, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

That's the problem with mega high risk, AIM start ups like a Junior Gold Explorer / Miner like GRL, it's cash hungry, until the point its not, and it's self sustaining in revenue and positive cash, and its timing this as an PI that is the skill. AIMS / Paracle, and whomever else ponied up this cash obviously think its a good investment, and believe EP is the person to lead it, their information will be better than ours. If you want my tuppence, I believe we will achieve over 2k ounces production in Q1 this year. Hold me to this statement.",

In parts almost word for word. And not enough explanation has been given as to why production slowed to a crawl in H2, swept under the carpet and so can\u2019t be sure they\u2019ll even hit the ground running with these near $5k gold price. If I end up closing out other positions and this retraces a bit more I\u2019ll maybe take a punt but for now remains on the watchlist - would I be shocked if this eventually ends up at 5p+ ?

The vote was passed on a show of hands, which illustrates the importance of being there if you are serious about involvement. Mr Robinson (possibly as a proxy of Somercourt Investments, his family office)as an existing shareholder was present and joined the discussion. He assured us he is not an insider, knows no more than any of us what the board has in mind for broadening the focus of the company but is supportive nevertheless.  I detected no intention to demand a seventh director but given the gist of his positive intervention I was not inclined to try to pin him down and neither did anyone else.  Given his experience, status and access to analytical support no one here can lay claim to it seems appropriate to get in behind him but that's a personal choice of course.  The two new directors were in the room and appeared engaged but probably rightly did not contribute to the discussion. One has deep Sierra Leone experience, the relevance of which is clear, the other has Ghana experience which will be invaluable given the social desire for change and legislative developments there.  The board met before and after in private and you can read the result for yourself.",

Neither was Angela present or mentioned. After having attended several AGM\u2019s, this meeting felt different. Rather than explaining the most recent issues, explain away upsets, as most other meetings seemed to do, this meeting came out with a plan. Here are my notes from the meeting: \u2022\tDue to issues at the AGM (an ambush from an unfriendly agent, if I understood correctly \u2013 I was not present), financing issues could not be properly addressed. They have been in the present EGM. \u2022\tThe present meeting was organised to put forward and complete the investment attracted to complete the reorganisation and restructure of the company to expedite progress in Ghana. \u2022\tThe investor (George Robinson \u2013 see below) came in at a substantial premium to share price. The confidence in this investment has been confirmed by the rise in share price. \u2022\tGeorge Robinson has been an investor since 2017. He is part of a family investment group as well as Sloane Robinson, private investors into the metals industries. I was told that they have been very successful. He was present, and gave a very positive view of his investment. \u2022\tWe were told that historic local creditors have all now been paid (diesel, cyanide, etc), so the Ghana company is in financial state. \u2022\tThere is lots of potential from the area surrounding the main pit, and which will be drilled. Stage one will drill approx. 5,000 metres, whilst there will be 16,000 \u2013 18,000 metres to follow. \u2022\tWe were told that there are approx  600,000ozs of known gold in the ground. This sets Goldstone up for a prospective future if this is maintained.",

          "content": "It\u2019s great news unless you don\u2019t hold and want a lower entry lol The statement refers to a single gold pour of approximately 12 kilograms of dor\u00e9 (a semi-pure alloy, typically mostly gold with some silver and impurities) completed at the end of January 2026, which the company equates to approximately 385 ounces. This is the contained gold content in troy ounces (the standard unit for precious metals). The conversion uses the fact that 1 kilogram \u2248 32.1507 troy ounces, so: - 12 kg \u00d7 32.1507 oz/kg \u2248 385.8 troy ounces (rounded to 385 ounces in the statement). Dor\u00e9 bars are not pure gold (often 90\u201399% gold), but the \"equivalent to approximately 385 ounces\" specifically means the fine gold content (pure gold weight) in troy ounces, after accounting for the actual purity of that dor\u00e9 pour. Annual Equivalent: The quote describes one pour (for one month, January 2026). To estimate an annual production rate, assuming this pour is representative of monthly output and production continues at a similar pace throughout the year: - 385 ounces per month \u00d7 12 months = approximately 4,620 ounces per year. This is a rough extrapolation (actual monthly pours can vary due to processing, ore grades, etc.), but it gives a sense of scale: roughly 4,600\u20134,700 ounces of gold per year if sustained at that level.",

From the RNS date 21 Jan: Homase mine investment: it is observed that all the money invested in Homase since 2022 has actually reduced the production - good investment EP: (RNS Dated 30 Dec 2022 production = 5153 troy ounces of GOLD, RNS dated 7th Jan 2026 production = 2912 troy ounces of GOLD) - well done EP, have a biscuit. Paying-off gold loan - interest payment on this mickey mouse loan has probably dwarfed the actual loan (actual loan was $3m) - EP to give AIMS another 13% equity - thats approx 30% total. AIMS investment = $3m. AIMS returns = $3.8m in equity,  creditor of $9m for outstanding gold loan (based on the recent conversion rate). AIMS returns already now at $12.8m. Suggesting an APR of 35%. EP deserves a chocolate Hobnob for that financial bargaining (suspect anyone else would get a better return if using their visa or mastercard). Now blindly investing in Sierra Leone (no information provide - so blind investment to SH) - even though GRL cannot even pay salaries - all managed by EP. Note: 5153oz annual production (from 2022)  would produce revenue of over $25m.",

As we all know the share price has just reached that level and fallen back. The iron rule of placings at discount is that the share price falls back. So here we are. The fixation with tailings may well have suppressed the price when the value really lies in the exploration. Not much on tailings in the RNS. Given this I would imagine Mr Robinson has been briefed on the exploration plan and therefore the counter parties. So either he thinks 1p is the value now and in two years time or he is looking to make a good turn on his money. I was simply asking how others feel about the warrants being at the same price as the subscription when often they anticipate growth and with talk of Sierra Leone the RNS points to considerably more than just keeping the pits open and the lights on.\"",

You have clearly had more experience than me of the ups and downs of Goldstone (having watched them since 2019/2020) as I'm a fairly new investor in this particular share.

I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

I thought the point of share chat sites was to encourage discussion and debate about the share in question,  to try to put forward considered and balanced points of view and not to be constantly negative (or positive). You have clearly had more experience than me of the ups and downs of Goldstone (having watched them since 2019/2020) as I'm a fairly new investor in this particular share. It does seem a long time to merely be watching a company. As for the script of 'Fawlty Towers' it's probably one of the best ever written!",

          "content": "Mr 05, \". . could you please tell me why you are invested in Goldstone resources. . \", sorry - I do not join in such irrelevant discussion. I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

If they never allowed the roll-over - then my statement below is an acceptable way forward - as the gold-loan was worth considerably more than the MCAP value of GRL that includes the ownership of Homase licence. Together with the recent knowledge that production since September 2025 is probably less than the amount of gold in a Ratners wedding ring - suggest some look at divine intervention. However - with gold price as it is - and any evidence from GRL that they are actually achieving the low production levels stated recently in RNS - then it is possible for MCAP to get to \u00a325m+ if gold price shows stability.",

With the new board now settled in, by the sounds of it overseeing day to day activities, along with lessons learnt and the experience gained over the last two years or so, should make the whole process more efficient yielding greater gold production..........in theory! :-)",

You'll know after EGM anyway because at 17% they'll have to declare. Paracle have just about too few shares now that 17%+existing shares wouldn't put them over 30% so it's possible. But my bet is it's (really) AIMS, and when the warrant exercise they own 60% and the show. It's tempting as a trade - but I don't trust EP enough :) good luck those that do!",

It was priced to fail. I would only have put a small amount in and, being not a trader, in the end didn't. It was obvious even the stay of execution would get a rerate with any better news a bigger rerate. These are the events traders look for which is why they come in before/after news to try and pump it Instead I put my money elsewhere and I hope it works out - I went asx/psl where they're drilling next to Greatlands plot. Hopefully it works out. I remain very bullish on gold (this is my first gold divestment since GRL debarcle), very bearish on EP here, but as always, I hope you guys win, it sucks to lose, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. What we can all agree on long may the price of gold rise, and I don't think there's that much chance of a reversal with the Big Orange in charge over the pond. GLA",

In parts almost word for word. And not enough explanation has been given as to why production slowed to a crawl in H2, swept under the carpet and so can\u2019t be sure they\u2019ll even hit the ground running with these near $5k gold price. If I end up closing out other positions and this retraces a bit more I\u2019ll maybe take a punt but for now remains on the watchlist - would I be shocked if this eventually ends up at 5p+ ? No, it\u2019s more than possible now so GL to holders :)",

This interim role will be covered until such time as Mr Wilkins's and Mr Edwards-Jones's suspension is over and a conclusion has been reached on the outcome of the investigation.

The vote was passed on a show of hands, which illustrates the importance of being there if you are serious about involvement. Mr Robinson (possibly as a proxy of Somercourt Investments, his family office)as an existing shareholder was present and joined the discussion. He assured us he is not an insider, knows no more than any of us what the board has in mind for broadening the focus of the company but is supportive nevertheless.  I detected no intention to demand a seventh director but given the gist of his positive intervention I was not inclined to try to pin him down and neither did anyone else.  Given his experience, status and access to analytical support no one here can lay claim to it seems appropriate to get in behind him but that's a personal choice of course.  The two new directors were in the room and appeared engaged but probably rightly did not contribute to the discussion. One has deep Sierra Leone experience, the relevance of which is clear, the other has Ghana experience which will be invaluable given the social desire for change and legislative developments there.  The board met before and after in private and you can read the result for yourself.",

Neither was Angela present or mentioned. After having attended several AGM\u2019s, this meeting felt different. Rather than explaining the most recent issues, explain away upsets, as most other meetings seemed to do, this meeting came out with a plan. Here are my notes from the meeting: \u2022\tDue to issues at the AGM (an ambush from an unfriendly agent, if I understood correctly \u2013 I was not present), financing issues could not be properly addressed. They have been in the present EGM. \u2022\tThe present meeting was organised to put forward and complete the investment attracted to complete the reorganisation and restructure of the company to expedite progress in Ghana. \u2022\tThe investor (George Robinson \u2013 see below) came in at a substantial premium to share price. The confidence in this investment has been confirmed by the rise in share price. \u2022\tGeorge Robinson has been an investor since 2017. He is part of a family investment group as well as Sloane Robinson, private investors into the metals industries. I was told that they have been very successful. He was present, and gave a very positive view of his investment. \u2022\tWe were told that historic local creditors have all now been paid (diesel, cyanide, etc), so the Ghana company is in financial state. \u2022\tThere is lots of potential from the area surrounding the main pit, and which will be drilled. Stage one will drill approx. 5,000 metres, whilst there will be 16,000 \u2013 18,000 metres to follow. \u2022\tWe were told that there are approx  600,000ozs of known gold in the ground. This sets Goldstone up for a prospective future if this is maintained.",

          "content": "It\u2019s great news unless you don\u2019t hold and want a lower entry lol The statement refers to a single gold pour of approximately 12 kilograms of dor\u00e9 (a semi-pure alloy, typically mostly gold with some silver and impurities) completed at the end of January 2026, which the company equates to approximately 385 ounces. This is the contained gold content in troy ounces (the standard unit for precious metals). The conversion uses the fact that 1 kilogram \u2248 32.1507 troy ounces, so: - 12 kg \u00d7 32.1507 oz/kg \u2248 385.8 troy ounces (rounded to 385 ounces in the statement). Dor\u00e9 bars are not pure gold (often 90\u201399% gold), but the \"equivalent to approximately 385 ounces\" specifically means the fine gold content (pure gold weight) in troy ounces, after accounting for the actual purity of that dor\u00e9 pour. Annual Equivalent: The quote describes one pour (for one month, January 2026). To estimate an annual production rate, assuming this pour is representative of monthly output and production continues at a similar pace throughout the year: - 385 ounces per month \u00d7 12 months = approximately 4,620 ounces per year. This is a rough extrapolation (actual monthly pours can vary due to processing, ore grades, etc.), but it gives a sense of scale: roughly 4,600\u20134,700 ounces of gold per year if sustained at that level.",

From the RNS date 21 Jan: Homase mine investment: it is observed that all the money invested in Homase since 2022 has actually reduced the production - good investment EP: (RNS Dated 30 Dec 2022 production = 5153 troy ounces of GOLD, RNS dated 7th Jan 2026 production = 2912 troy ounces of GOLD) - well done EP, have a biscuit. Paying-off gold loan - interest payment on this mickey mouse loan has probably dwarfed the actual loan (actual loan was $3m) - EP to give AIMS another 13% equity - thats approx 30% total. AIMS investment = $3m. AIMS returns = $3.8m in equity,  creditor of $9m for outstanding gold loan (based on the recent conversion rate). AIMS returns already now at $12.8m. Suggesting an APR of 35%. EP deserves a chocolate Hobnob for that financial bargaining (suspect anyone else would get a better return if using their visa or mastercard). Now blindly investing in Sierra Leone (no information provide - so blind investment to SH) - even though GRL cannot even pay salaries - all managed by EP. Note: 5153oz annual production (from 2022)  would produce revenue of over $25m.",

As we all know the share price has just reached that level and fallen back. The iron rule of placings at discount is that the share price falls back. So here we are. The fixation with tailings may well have suppressed the price when the value really lies in the exploration. Not much on tailings in the RNS. Given this I would imagine Mr Robinson has been briefed on the exploration plan and therefore the counter parties. So either he thinks 1p is the value now and in two years time or he is looking to make a good turn on his money. I was simply asking how others feel about the warrants being at the same price as the subscription when often they anticipate growth and with talk of Sierra Leone the RNS points to considerably more than just keeping the pits open and the lights on.\"",

Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

If they never allowed the roll-over - then my statement below is an acceptable way forward - as the gold-loan was worth considerably more than the MCAP value of GRL that includes the ownership of Homase licence. Together with the recent knowledge that production since September 2025 is probably less than the amount of gold in a Ratners wedding ring - suggest some look at divine intervention. However - with gold price as it is - and any evidence from GRL that they are actually achieving the low production levels stated recently in RNS - then it is possible for MCAP to get to \u00a325m+ if gold price shows stability.",

I make that somewhere in the region of 5 to 10p a share if you can get AISCs at $2.5k an ounce. It's always been an insane risk v reward proposition here, and its getting less and less risky.",

I know you asked boo but I to would expect an improvement in gold production from the next update for a few reasons: 1. It's the dry season now, therefore no delays from rainfall 2.  \"A new screening and conveying system was completed and commissioned in December 2025, enabling stacking rates of up to 56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month, providing increased operational flexibility.\" That's obviously depending on whether it's on-line and working after commissioning! 3. \"The mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods\" 4. With the new board now settled in, by the sounds of it overseeing day to day activities, along with lessons learnt and the experience gained over the last two years or so, should make the whole process more efficient yielding greater gold production..........in theory! :-)",

My opinion is their current operation is basically keeping the lights on while they 'try' to achieve their long term plan ! The board is now stronger, again in my opinion, and with the recent financial boost the company is looking in a far better state for said future growth! Exciting times one way or t'other!",

You'll know after EGM anyway because at 17% they'll have to declare. Paracle have just about too few shares now that 17%+existing shares wouldn't put them over 30% so it's possible. But my bet is it's (really) AIMS, and when the warrant exercise they own 60% and the show. It's tempting as a trade - but I don't trust EP enough :) good luck those that do!",

It was obvious even the stay of execution would get a rerate with any better news a bigger rerate. These are the events traders look for which is why they come in before/after news to try and pump it Instead I put my money elsewhere and I hope it works out - I went asx/psl where they're drilling next to Greatlands plot. Hopefully it works out. I remain very bullish on gold (this is my first gold divestment since GRL debarcle), very bearish on EP here, but as always, I hope you guys win, it sucks to lose, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

There was lots of optimise 13 months ago based on wording in previous RNS. Just because production figures are stated to be lower for this year than last year -many posters here actually now believe EP telling truth - but historically - suggest this is difficult. 6 years of krap incorrect information - maybe it shall be 7 years at the end of 2026 - so be cautious of future statements - and only believe production figures which needs to be factual. Production since august/september is non existence - will they provide production figures for January or February  !!? My view - EP's history speaks for itself.",

That's the problem with mega high risk, AIM start ups like a Junior Gold Explorer / Miner like GRL, it's cash hungry, until the point its not, and it's self sustaining in revenue and positive cash, and its timing this as an PI that is the skill. AIMS / Paracle, and whomever else ponied up this cash obviously think its a good investment, and believe EP is the person to lead it, their information will be better than ours. If you want my tuppence, I believe we will achieve over 2k ounces production in Q1 this year. Hold me to this statement.",

If I end up closing out other positions and this retraces a bit more I\u2019ll maybe take a punt but for now remains on the watchlist - would I be shocked if this eventually ends up at 5p+ ?

People like us put our real, hard earned money into companies like GRL based on the information that people in a position like yours put out.  Just one of the many smoke and mirrors nonsense RNS\u2019s perpetrated by GRL during your tenure. Another example, as Kenny and others have pointed out, is that the actual production relative to the supposed stacking never added up. I for one am glad you\u2019ve gone and I hope you never gain any further control over this company. That\u2019s not to say we\u2019ve not still got glaring issues.

The Company has, to date, recovered and sold some 5,403 ounces of gold, with the remaining contained gold, estimated to be 5,553 ounces, still within the pads. The Company is assessing the economics of re-agglomerating this ore on the heap leach pads, as insufficient cement was added and this needs to be remediated. You was there .. what happened to the 5,553 ounces ? At the time I think it was Troy rather than dore ?? How can you explain this proven production back then when further plant etc. has been added and we go backwards to a 4,000 Oz target which I think now is dore weight ? 48,000t of ore stacking at over 1g/t - simply does not add up You have questions to answer also imho.",

The Company's Board has commenced investigations into allegations made in relation to Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's recent conduct and certain historic payments made to Lloyd Edwards-Jones S.A.S., the Company's former Corporate Finance Adviser. The investigations are being undertaken with input from the Company's professional advisers and a further announcement will be made as soon as these investigations have concluded. To minimise any disruption to the ongoing operations of the Company during the period of Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's suspension, the Company has put interim financial oversight arrangements in place while it advances the appointment of an interim CFO. This interim role will be covered until such time as Mr Wilkins's and Mr Edwards-Jones's suspension is over and a conclusion has been reached on the outcome of the investigation. The individual concerned will be supported by Catherine Evans, Chair of the Audit Committee and Ryan McDermott, CEO, as well as by other members of the Board and senior management team to ensure operational continuity.",

The Company's Board has commenced investigations into allegations made in relation to Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's recent conduct and certain historic payments made to Lloyd Edwards-Jones S.A.S., the Company's former Corporate Finance Adviser. The investigations are being undertaken with input from the Company's professional advisers and a further announcement will be made as soon as these investigations have concluded. To minimise any disruption to the ongoing operations of the Company during the period of Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's suspension, the Company has put interim financial oversight arrangements in place while it advances the appointment of an interim CFO. This interim role will be covered until such time as Mr Wilkins's and Mr Edwards-Jones's suspension is over and a conclusion has been reached on the outcome of the investigation. The individual concerned will be supported by Catherine Evans, Chair of the Audit Committee and Ryan McDermott, CEO, as well as by other members of the Board and senior management team to ensure operational continuity.",

The vote was passed on a show of hands, which illustrates the importance of being there if you are serious about involvement. Mr Robinson (possibly as a proxy of Somercourt Investments, his family office)as an existing shareholder was present and joined the discussion. He assured us he is not an insider, knows no more than any of us what the board has in mind for broadening the focus of the company but is supportive nevertheless.  I detected no intention to demand a seventh director but given the gist of his positive intervention I was not inclined to try to pin him down and neither did anyone else.  Given his experience, status and access to analytical support no one here can lay claim to it seems appropriate to get in behind him but that's a personal choice of course.  The two new directors were in the room and appeared engaged but probably rightly did not contribute to the discussion. One has deep Sierra Leone experience, the relevance of which is clear, the other has Ghana experience which will be invaluable given the social desire for change and legislative developments there.  The board met before and after in private and you can read the result for yourself.",

Neither was Angela present or mentioned. After having attended several AGM\u2019s, this meeting felt different. Rather than explaining the most recent issues, explain away upsets, as most other meetings seemed to do, this meeting came out with a plan. Here are my notes from the meeting: \u2022\tDue to issues at the AGM (an ambush from an unfriendly agent, if I understood correctly \u2013 I was not present), financing issues could not be properly addressed. They have been in the present EGM. \u2022\tThe present meeting was organised to put forward and complete the investment attracted to complete the reorganisation and restructure of the company to expedite progress in Ghana. \u2022\tThe investor (George Robinson \u2013 see below) came in at a substantial premium to share price. The confidence in this investment has been confirmed by the rise in share price. \u2022\tGeorge Robinson has been an investor since 2017. He is part of a family investment group as well as Sloane Robinson, private investors into the metals industries. I was told that they have been very successful. He was present, and gave a very positive view of his investment. \u2022\tWe were told that historic local creditors have all now been paid (diesel, cyanide, etc), so the Ghana company is in financial state. \u2022\tThere is lots of potential from the area surrounding the main pit, and which will be drilled. Stage one will drill approx. 5,000 metres, whilst there will be 16,000 \u2013 18,000 metres to follow. \u2022\tWe were told that there are approx  600,000ozs of known gold in the ground. This sets Goldstone up for a prospective future if this is maintained.",

          "content": "It\u2019s great news unless you don\u2019t hold and want a lower entry lol The statement refers to a single gold pour of approximately 12 kilograms of dor\u00e9 (a semi-pure alloy, typically mostly gold with some silver and impurities) completed at the end of January 2026, which the company equates to approximately 385 ounces. This is the contained gold content in troy ounces (the standard unit for precious metals). The conversion uses the fact that 1 kilogram \u2248 32.1507 troy ounces, so: - 12 kg \u00d7 32.1507 oz/kg \u2248 385.8 troy ounces (rounded to 385 ounces in the statement). Dor\u00e9 bars are not pure gold (often 90\u201399% gold), but the \"equivalent to approximately 385 ounces\" specifically means the fine gold content (pure gold weight) in troy ounces, after accounting for the actual purity of that dor\u00e9 pour. Annual Equivalent: The quote describes one pour (for one month, January 2026). To estimate an annual production rate, assuming this pour is representative of monthly output and production continues at a similar pace throughout the year: - 385 ounces per month \u00d7 12 months = approximately 4,620 ounces per year. This is a rough extrapolation (actual monthly pours can vary due to processing, ore grades, etc.), but it gives a sense of scale: roughly 4,600\u20134,700 ounces of gold per year if sustained at that level.",

Paying-off gold loan - interest payment on this mickey mouse loan has probably dwarfed the actual loan (actual loan was $3m) - EP to give AIMS another 13% equity - thats approx 30% total. AIMS investment = $3m. AIMS returns = $3.8m in equity,  creditor of $9m for outstanding gold loan (based on the recent conversion rate). AIMS returns already now at $12.8m. Suggesting an APR of 35%. EP deserves a chocolate Hobnob for that financial bargaining (suspect anyone else would get a better return if using their visa or mastercard). Now blindly investing in Sierra Leone (no information provide - so blind investment to SH) - even though GRL cannot even pay salaries - all managed by EP. Note: 5153oz annual production (from 2022)  would produce revenue of over $25m.",

As we all know the share price has just reached that level and fallen back. The iron rule of placings at discount is that the share price falls back. So here we are. The fixation with tailings may well have suppressed the price when the value really lies in the exploration. Not much on tailings in the RNS. Given this I would imagine Mr Robinson has been briefed on the exploration plan and therefore the counter parties. So either he thinks 1p is the value now and in two years time or he is looking to make a good turn on his money. I was simply asking how others feel about the warrants being at the same price as the subscription when often they anticipate growth and with talk of Sierra Leone the RNS points to considerably more than just keeping the pits open and the lights on.\"",

You have clearly had more experience than me of the ups and downs of Goldstone (having watched them since 2019/2020) as I'm a fairly new investor in this particular share. It does seem a long time to merely be watching a company. As for the script of 'Fawlty Towers' it's probably one of the best ever written!",

I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

I thought the point of share chat sites was to encourage discussion and debate about the share in question,  to try to put forward considered and balanced points of view and not to be constantly negative (or positive). You have clearly had more experience than me of the ups and downs of Goldstone (having watched them since 2019/2020) as I'm a fairly new investor in this particular share. It does seem a long time to merely be watching a company. As for the script of 'Fawlty Towers' it's probably one of the best ever written!",

          "content": "Mr 05, \". . could you please tell me why you are invested in Goldstone resources. . \", sorry - I do not join in such irrelevant discussion. I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

If they never allowed the roll-over - then my statement below is an acceptable way forward - as the gold-loan was worth considerably more than the MCAP value of GRL that includes the ownership of Homase licence. Together with the recent knowledge that production since September 2025 is probably less than the amount of gold in a Ratners wedding ring - suggest some look at divine intervention. However - with gold price as it is - and any evidence from GRL that they are actually achieving the low production levels stated recently in RNS - then it is possible for MCAP to get to \u00a325m+ if gold price shows stability.",

GRL are in a bit of a speculation situation regarding the SP after the recent rise so now all depends on news after the EGM which is on Thursday, 5 February to see where they are heading, in my opinion.

With the new board now settled in, by the sounds of it overseeing day to day activities, along with lessons learnt and the experience gained over the last two years or so, should make the whole process more efficient yielding greater gold production..........in theory! :-)",

You'll know after EGM anyway because at 17% they'll have to declare. Paracle have just about too few shares now that 17%+existing shares wouldn't put them over 30% so it's possible. But my bet is it's (really) AIMS, and when the warrant exercise they own 60% and the show. It's tempting as a trade - but I don't trust EP enough :) good luck those that do!",

It was priced to fail. I would only have put a small amount in and, being not a trader, in the end didn't. It was obvious even the stay of execution would get a rerate with any better news a bigger rerate. These are the events traders look for which is why they come in before/after news to try and pump it Instead I put my money elsewhere and I hope it works out - I went asx/psl where they're drilling next to Greatlands plot. Hopefully it works out. I remain very bullish on gold (this is my first gold divestment since GRL debarcle), very bearish on EP here, but as always, I hope you guys win, it sucks to lose, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. What we can all agree on long may the price of gold rise, and I don't think there's that much chance of a reversal with the Big Orange in charge over the pond. GLA",

Production since august/september is non existence - will they provide production figures for January or February  !!? My view - EP's history speaks for itself.",

In parts almost word for word. And not enough explanation has been given as to why production slowed to a crawl in H2, swept under the carpet and so can\u2019t be sure they\u2019ll even hit the ground running with these near $5k gold price. If I end up closing out other positions and this retraces a bit more I\u2019ll maybe take a punt but for now remains on the watchlist - would I be shocked if this eventually ends up at 5p+ ? No, it\u2019s more than possible now so GL to holders :)",

Not helped by in-house company issues either! The 'targets' have been lowered for this year which are now more or less the same level as 2022 and that's with all the new machinery in place along with other plant enhancements ! I believe a lot of the under performing is mainly due to : 1. GRL are operating a very small scale mining operation (one step up from actually panning for gold) where the slightest issue is detrimental to gold production 2. A lack of experience by GRL management in actually running a very small scale mining operation as their 2025 'targets' prove 3. The rainy season does affect production in a big way and especially with the size of this operation 4. In-house company issues but hopefully all now resolved with a stronger more focused team! Therefore with recent further improvements to plant now in place and the experience gained over the last few years I am expecting a better year for both the company and the SP....he says bravely or stupidly before anyone says it!  :-) 5 February 2026 -\"and the Company looks forward to progressing a 4,000-5,000 metre drill programme over the next six months.\" An update regarding this is called for as it reads like one of last years 'targets' as in I look forward to winning the lottery every week!",

The Company's Board has commenced investigations into allegations made in relation to Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's recent conduct and certain historic payments made to Lloyd Edwards-Jones S.A.S., the Company's former Corporate Finance Adviser. The investigations are being undertaken with input from the Company's professional advisers and a further announcement will be made as soon as these investigations have concluded. To minimise any disruption to the ongoing operations of the Company during the period of Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's suspension, the Company has put interim financial oversight arrangements in place while it advances the appointment of an interim CFO. This interim role will be covered until such time as Mr Wilkins's and Mr Edwards-Jones's suspension is over and a conclusion has been reached on the outcome of the investigation. The individual concerned will be supported by Catherine Evans, Chair of the Audit Committee and Ryan McDermott, CEO, as well as by other members of the Board and senior management team to ensure operational continuity.",

The Company's Board has commenced investigations into allegations made in relation to Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's recent conduct and certain historic payments made to Lloyd Edwards-Jones S.A.S., the Company's former Corporate Finance Adviser. The investigations are being undertaken with input from the Company's professional advisers and a further announcement will be made as soon as these investigations have concluded. To minimise any disruption to the ongoing operations of the Company during the period of Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's suspension, the Company has put interim financial oversight arrangements in place while it advances the appointment of an interim CFO. This interim role will be covered until such time as Mr Wilkins's and Mr Edwards-Jones's suspension is over and a conclusion has been reached on the outcome of the investigation. The individual concerned will be supported by Catherine Evans, Chair of the Audit Committee and Ryan McDermott, CEO, as well as by other members of the Board and senior management team to ensure operational continuity.",

The vote was passed on a show of hands, which illustrates the importance of being there if you are serious about involvement. Mr Robinson (possibly as a proxy of Somercourt Investments, his family office)as an existing shareholder was present and joined the discussion. He assured us he is not an insider, knows no more than any of us what the board has in mind for broadening the focus of the company but is supportive nevertheless.  I detected no intention to demand a seventh director but given the gist of his positive intervention I was not inclined to try to pin him down and neither did anyone else.  Given his experience, status and access to analytical support no one here can lay claim to it seems appropriate to get in behind him but that's a personal choice of course.  The two new directors were in the room and appeared engaged but probably rightly did not contribute to the discussion. One has deep Sierra Leone experience, the relevance of which is clear, the other has Ghana experience which will be invaluable given the social desire for change and legislative developments there.  The board met before and after in private and you can read the result for yourself.",

Neither was Angela present or mentioned. After having attended several AGM\u2019s, this meeting felt different. Rather than explaining the most recent issues, explain away upsets, as most other meetings seemed to do, this meeting came out with a plan. Here are my notes from the meeting: \u2022\tDue to issues at the AGM (an ambush from an unfriendly agent, if I understood correctly \u2013 I was not present), financing issues could not be properly addressed. They have been in the present EGM. \u2022\tThe present meeting was organised to put forward and complete the investment attracted to complete the reorganisation and restructure of the company to expedite progress in Ghana. \u2022\tThe investor (George Robinson \u2013 see below) came in at a substantial premium to share price. The confidence in this investment has been confirmed by the rise in share price. \u2022\tGeorge Robinson has been an investor since 2017. He is part of a family investment group as well as Sloane Robinson, private investors into the metals industries. I was told that they have been very successful. He was present, and gave a very positive view of his investment. \u2022\tWe were told that historic local creditors have all now been paid (diesel, cyanide, etc), so the Ghana company is in financial state. \u2022\tThere is lots of potential from the area surrounding the main pit, and which will be drilled. Stage one will drill approx. 5,000 metres, whilst there will be 16,000 \u2013 18,000 metres to follow. \u2022\tWe were told that there are approx  600,000ozs of known gold in the ground. This sets Goldstone up for a prospective future if this is maintained.",

          "content": "It\u2019s great news unless you don\u2019t hold and want a lower entry lol The statement refers to a single gold pour of approximately 12 kilograms of dor\u00e9 (a semi-pure alloy, typically mostly gold with some silver and impurities) completed at the end of January 2026, which the company equates to approximately 385 ounces. This is the contained gold content in troy ounces (the standard unit for precious metals). The conversion uses the fact that 1 kilogram \u2248 32.1507 troy ounces, so: - 12 kg \u00d7 32.1507 oz/kg \u2248 385.8 troy ounces (rounded to 385 ounces in the statement). Dor\u00e9 bars are not pure gold (often 90\u201399% gold), but the \"equivalent to approximately 385 ounces\" specifically means the fine gold content (pure gold weight) in troy ounces, after accounting for the actual purity of that dor\u00e9 pour. Annual Equivalent: The quote describes one pour (for one month, January 2026). To estimate an annual production rate, assuming this pour is representative of monthly output and production continues at a similar pace throughout the year: - 385 ounces per month \u00d7 12 months = approximately 4,620 ounces per year. This is a rough extrapolation (actual monthly pours can vary due to processing, ore grades, etc.), but it gives a sense of scale: roughly 4,600\u20134,700 ounces of gold per year if sustained at that level.",

From the RNS date 21 Jan: Homase mine investment: it is observed that all the money invested in Homase since 2022 has actually reduced the production - good investment EP: (RNS Dated 30 Dec 2022 production = 5153 troy ounces of GOLD, RNS dated 7th Jan 2026 production = 2912 troy ounces of GOLD) - well done EP, have a biscuit. Paying-off gold loan - interest payment on this mickey mouse loan has probably dwarfed the actual loan (actual loan was $3m) - EP to give AIMS another 13% equity - thats approx 30% total. AIMS investment = $3m. AIMS returns = $3.8m in equity,  creditor of $9m for outstanding gold loan (based on the recent conversion rate). AIMS returns already now at $12.8m. Suggesting an APR of 35%. EP deserves a chocolate Hobnob for that financial bargaining (suspect anyone else would get a better return if using their visa or mastercard). Now blindly investing in Sierra Leone (no information provide - so blind investment to SH) - even though GRL cannot even pay salaries - all managed by EP. Note: 5153oz annual production (from 2022)  would produce revenue of over $25m.",

As we all know the share price has just reached that level and fallen back. The iron rule of placings at discount is that the share price falls back. So here we are. The fixation with tailings may well have suppressed the price when the value really lies in the exploration. Not much on tailings in the RNS. Given this I would imagine Mr Robinson has been briefed on the exploration plan and therefore the counter parties. So either he thinks 1p is the value now and in two years time or he is looking to make a good turn on his money. I was simply asking how others feel about the warrants being at the same price as the subscription when often they anticipate growth and with talk of Sierra Leone the RNS points to considerably more than just keeping the pits open and the lights on.\"",

I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

I thought the point of share chat sites was to encourage discussion and debate about the share in question,  to try to put forward considered and balanced points of view and not to be constantly negative (or positive). You have clearly had more experience than me of the ups and downs of Goldstone (having watched them since 2019/2020) as I'm a fairly new investor in this particular share. It does seem a long time to merely be watching a company. As for the script of 'Fawlty Towers' it's probably one of the best ever written!",

          "content": "Mr 05, \". . could you please tell me why you are invested in Goldstone resources. . \", sorry - I do not join in such irrelevant discussion. I am interested in GRL based on their historic RNS statements going back to 2019/2020. Please read - especially the ones released throughout 2022 - they make as good reading as the script to faulty towers. Prospects going forward! - wonderful if you believe even half the wording in the RNS !! The use of the word \"believe\" in that statement is the main issue. If gold grades are there (and I have doubts) - then I am sure the Homase mine can be profitable (if no debt attached - such as the gold loan). One serious help over the last 6 months - the increase in Au price has kept GRL alive - and even if the gold grades are lower than the JORC code states - then the high price keeps it moving forward and even low production can maintain payment to keep the lights on. I do see the company MCAP increasing to \u00a325m+ if they show evidence they can maintain minimum of 400 oz/month and Au over $4500 oz together with planned production improvements. Note - the AISC is currently higher than the gold price was in earlier 2025 - and considering it was suggested to be in $600oz in Dec 2021 - something is seriously wrong. This risk shall be with this company until it at least halves the AISC. I also think GRL are struggling to keep AISC even at the higher limit of the range based on lack of detail/evidence they have provided - every forward statement they have released in RNS since 2020 - have been followed later by the actual performance figures being magnitures worst. So MCAP \u00a325m if their RNS are true!!",

If they never allowed the roll-over - then my statement below is an acceptable way forward - as the gold-loan was worth considerably more than the MCAP value of GRL that includes the ownership of Homase licence. Together with the recent knowledge that production since September 2025 is probably less than the amount of gold in a Ratners wedding ring - suggest some look at divine intervention. However - with gold price as it is - and any evidence from GRL that they are actually achieving the low production levels stated recently in RNS - then it is possible for MCAP to get to \u00a325m+ if gold price shows stability.",

It's the dry season now, therefore no delays from rainfall 2.  \"A new screening and conveying system was completed and commissioned in December 2025, enabling stacking rates of up to 56,000 tonnes of agglomerated ore per month, providing increased operational flexibility.\" That's obviously depending on whether it's on-line and working after commissioning! 3. \"The mining schedule has been restructured to maximise production during drier operational periods\" 4. With the new board now settled in, by the sounds of it overseeing day to day activities, along with lessons learnt and the experience gained over the last two years or so, should make the whole process more efficient yielding greater gold production..........in theory! :-)",

I\u2019ve seen so many false dawns with this outfit. Remember  corporate investors putting in chunks at 8p or something? We all expected they must know something and went with it. Now people are getting fizzy b*lls over 1.5p Remember Bill Trew saying they should do 28,000oz for the year? Remember EP blatantly lying that GRl was on course for 1000oz a month from Jan \u201825? I hope it goes ballistic, but I think you can only ever have a very modest level in trust in anything this board of directors says.",

I think what most are missing, whether deliberately or not, is that GRL were/are a very small mining company but they are producing gold from a very gold rich area of Ghana! My opinion is their current operation is basically keeping the lights on while they 'try' to achieve their long term plan ! The board is now stronger, again in my opinion, and with the recent financial boost the company is looking in a far better state for said future growth! Exciting times one way or t'other!",

You'll know after EGM anyway because at 17% they'll have to declare. Paracle have just about too few shares now that 17%+existing shares wouldn't put them over 30% so it's possible.

It was obvious even the stay of execution would get a rerate with any better news a bigger rerate. These are the events traders look for which is why they come in before/after news to try and pump it Instead I put my money elsewhere and I hope it works out - I went asx/psl where they're drilling next to Greatlands plot. Hopefully it works out. I remain very bullish on gold (this is my first gold divestment since GRL debarcle), very bearish on EP here, but as always, I hope you guys win, it sucks to lose, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

In parts almost word for word. And not enough explanation has been given as to why production slowed to a crawl in H2, swept under the carpet and so can\u2019t be sure they\u2019ll even hit the ground running with these near $5k gold price. If I end up closing out other positions and this retraces a bit more I\u2019ll maybe take a punt but for now remains on the watchlist - would I be shocked if this eventually ends up at 5p+ ? No, it\u2019s more than possible now so GL to holders :)",
