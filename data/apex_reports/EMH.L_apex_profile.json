Often, but not always, forward looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward looking words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", and \"guidance\", or other similar words and may include, without limitation, sta\ntements regarding plans, strategies and objectives of management, anticipatedproduction or construction commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs.\nForward looking\nstatements inherently involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results, performance, and achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance, or achievements. Relevant factors may include, but are not limited to, changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange fluctuations and general economic conditions, increased costs and demand for production inputs, the speculative nature of exploration and project development, including the risks of obtaining necessary licences and permits and diminishing quantities or grades of reserves, political and social risks, changes to the regulatory framework within which the company operates or may in the future operate, environmental conditions including extreme weather conditions, recruitment and retention of personnel, industrial relations issues and litigation.\nForward looking\nstatements are based on the Company and its management's good faith assumptions relating to the financial, market, regulatory and other relevant environments that will exist and affect the company's business and operations in the future. The company does not give any assurance that the assumptions on which forward looking statements are based will prove to be correct, or that the company's business or operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not foreseen or foreseeable by the company or management or beyond the company's control.\nAlthough the Company attempts and has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in forward looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results, performance, achievements or events not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and many events are beyond the reasonable control of the company.\nAccordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements in these materials speak only at the date of issue. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange listing rules, in providing this information the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward looking statements or to advise of any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nLITHIUM CLASSIFICATION AND CONVERSION FACTORS\nLithium grades are normally presented in percentages or parts per million (ppm). Grades of deposits are also expressed as lithium compounds in percentages, for example as a percent lithium oxide (Li2O) content or percent lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) content.\nLithium carbonate equivalent (\"\nLCE\n\") is the industry standard terminology for, and is equivalent to, Li2CO3. Use of LCE is to provide data comparable with industry reports and is the total equivalent amount of lithium carbonate, assuming the lithium content in the deposit is converted to lithium carbonate, using the conversion rates in the table included below to get an equivalent Li2CO3 value in percent. Use of LCE assumes 100% recovery and no process losses in the extraction of Li2CO3 from the deposit.\nLithium resources and reserves are usually presented in tonnes of LCE or Li.\nThe standard conversion factors are set out in the table below:\nTable: Conversion Factors for Lithium Compounds and Minerals\nConvert from\nConvert to Li\nConvert to Li2O\nConvert to Li2CO3\nConvert to LiOH.H2O\nLithium\nLi\n1.000\n2.153\n5.325\n6.048\nLithium Oxide\nLi2O\n0.464\n1.000\n2.473\n2.809\nLithium Carbonate\nLi2CO3\n0.188\n0.404\n1.000\n1.136\nLithium Hydroxide\nLiOH.H2O\n0.165\n0.356\n0.880\n1.000\nLithium Fluoride\nLiF\n0.268\n0.576\n1.424\n1.618\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The documentation is expected to be made publicly available for consultation later this quarter, with the Ministry to determine the timing for public submissions and hearings.\nScope of the EIA\nThe EIA identifies and assesses potential environmental impacts associated with the Project and outlines proposed mitigation and management measures, including monitoring requirements. It considers physical, biological and socio-economic factors from an environmental protection perspective and incorporates the technical modelling required under Czech and EU regulations.\nEU Just Transition Fund Condition Met\nSubmission of the EIA satisfies a key condition of the EU Just Transition Fund (\nJTF\n) grant\nawarded to the Cinovec Project\n[2]\n.\nIn April 2025, the Czech selection panel approved\u00a0CZK 800 million\u00a0(approximately\u00a0US$36\nmillion\u00a0at the time) in grant funding.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nEuropean Metals Holdings Limited\n(ASX & AIM: EMH, OTCQX and OTCQB: EMHXY and EMHLF)\n(\"European Metals\" or the \"Company\")\nEMH UPDATED\nDFS CONFIRMS LONG-LIFE BATTERY-GRADE LITHIUM CARBONATE PRODUCER AT CINOVEC STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED TO SUPPLY EUROPEAN EV AND ENERGY-STORAGE SECTORS\nFurther to the announcement by the Company on 19 December 2025, and following discussions with the ASX, the DFS has been updated for the following reasons.\n(1) The ASX will not permit the inclusion of the final 4 years of the production schedule thereby reducing the production schedule from 27 years to 23 years. The Company has been forced to accept this refusal despite its confidence that the production schedule as originally year disclosed in its AIM announcement of 19 December 2025 is in compliance with the JORC Code.\n(2) This reduction in the mine plan has resulted in a reduction in the Pre-tax NPV8 of the Cinovec Project from 1.712bn to 1.455bn and the Pre-tax IRR from 15.3% to 14.8%.\n(3) The Company is highly confident that the inferred resources in years 24-27 of the Original mine plan will be converted to indicated resources upon additional infill drilling of the inferred resources (all prior upgrades from inferred have converted 100% of the inferred resources to indicated resources) however in order to allow trading in its shares on the ASX to continue it has reduced the mine plan for the DFS to 23 Years.\n(4) The Company is working with its consultants to revise the mine plan to revert to 27 years in a manner which is compliant with JORC and also with the ASX's interpretation thereof and to issue an updated DFS with these additional years included in the near future.\nThe updated DFS announcement is disclosed below.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nDefinitive Feasibility Study (DFS) confirms Cinovec as a long-life producer of battery-grade lithium carbonate, strategically located within the European EV and battery manufacturing corridor.\n\u00b7\nSteady-state (excluding ramp up/ramp down) production of 37,500tonnes per annum (tpa)\u00a0of battery-grade lithium carbonate (Li\u2082CO\u2083), representing\u00a0approximately 5.2% of EU demand in 2030\n[1]\nand sufficient for\u00a0up to 1,300,000 60kWh EV batteries annually\n[2]\n.\n\u00b7\n26+ year operating life, underpinned by a\u00a0JORC Resource of\n747.54 Mt @ 0.19% Li (0.40% Li\u2082O\u00a0) (7.45 Mt LCE)\nand a\u00a0JORC Reserve of\n54.40 Mt @ 0.27% Li (0.58% Li\u2082O\u00a0) (145,000 t contained Li)\n, with expansion optionality.\n\u00b7\nRobust economics based upon the first 23 years of the full LOM 27-year production schedule: (ungeared, using flat US$26,000 lithium carbonate price)\n[3]\no\nPre-tax NPV8%:\u00a0US$1.455bn (Inclusive of Grants and exclusive of inferred resources)\no\nPre-tax IRR:\u00a014.8% (Inclusive of Grants and exclusive of inferred resources)\no\nLOM C1 costs:\u00a0US$12,621/t;\no\nLOM AISC:\u00a0US$13,879/t\nNote: PFS price assumption for lithium carbonate is based on long term incentive price which exceeds current Chinese spot price\n[4]\n\u00b7\nInitial CAPEX of US$1.72bn (\n(including contingency and net of approved grants)\nand sustaining CAPEX (life of mine) of US$0.498B\n.\n\u00b7\nSignificant government support:\u00a0Approval for\u00a0up to EUR 360m\u00a0Czech Government grant +\u00a0US$36m\u00a0EU Just Transition Fund grant\n[5]\n.\n\u00b7\nDFS completion enables advancement of key workstreams:\no\nEU stakeholder engagement for additional grant and debt support\no\nFormal project financing discussions\no\nFinalisation of advanced off-take negotiations\n\u00b7\nVertically integrated project\u00a0comprising underground mine, Prun\u00e9\u0159ov beneficiation and lithium chemical plant and all necessary integration of utilities and transport requirements.\n\u00b7\nStrong ESG profile\u00a0aligned with EU CRMA, Equator Principles and International Finance Corporation standards.\nEuropean Metals Holdings Limited (\"European Metals\" or \"the Company\")\nannounces the results of the\u00a0Definitive Feasibility Study (\nDFS\n)\u00a0for the Cinovec Lithium Project (\nCinovec or Project\n), located in the Czech Republic. Cinovec hosts Europe's largest hard-rock lithium resource and one of the world's largest non-brine lithium deposits. The DFS was prepared by DRA Global (processing, including Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation (\nFECAB\n) and Lithium Chemical Plant (\nLCP\n)), Bara Consulting (mining), and specialist engineering, logistics, environmental and permitting consultants. Affiliated Czech\npartners, including CEZ, have also contributed extensive site, permitting, and regulatory frameworks.\nThe DFS builds on more than a decade of\ndrilling and sampling,\nmetallurgical testwork, mine design, environmental studies, permitting preparation, stakeholder engagement, infrastructure planning and engineering.\nThe Cinovec Project is fully located within the Czech Republic, providing\u00a0EU-domestic supply of lithium\u00a0to meet the continent's fast-growing requirements for EV batteries and energy-storage systems. The Project sits within 200-350 km of several gigafactories either operating, under construction, or planned within the EU and can benefit from its proximity to a large share of automotive industry entities (OEMs) in Central Europe with 22 car manufacturing plants within 400 km of Prague with over 8 million vehicles manufactured in the area annually.\nFigure 1: Cinovec's location with proximity to gigafactories/OEMs either operating, under construction, or planned within the EU\nExecutive Chairman\u00a0Keith Coughlan\u00a0said:\n\"The DFS confirms Cinovec as one of Europe's most advanced and strategically significant lithium projects. With strong economics, central location and substantial government backing - including approval for up to EUR 360 million in Czech Government grant funding - the Project is uniquely positioned to supply long-term lithium carbonate into the European battery and EV sectors.\nEMH\nis well placed\u00a0being in partnership with CEZ, a major Czech semi-government company, and together having attracted significant European grant funding. Post this funding, the Board will continue to minimise dilution at the corporate level as it focuses on funding alternatives at the project level. Geomet, being the project company for Cinovec, will be primarily responsible for raising the early-stage funds with the majority being required towards the end of 2026. The partners are in advanced discussion with various parties with a view to provide\u00a0funding to cover this requirement.\n\"With the DFS now released, we are advancing discussions with EU institutions regarding additional grants and strategic debt, progressing project financing with commercial lenders and potential strategic partners and moving toward the completion of off-take agreements, which are already at an advanced stage with major European battery and automotive groups. These steps collectively position Cinovec for a final investment decision.\"\nDFS Cautionary Statement\nThe DFS discussed herein has been undertaken to explore the technical and economic feasibility of developing the Cinovec Lithium Project to economically and sustainably exploit the Project's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve.\nGeomet s.r.o. controls the mineral exploration licenses awarded by the Czech State over the Cinovec Lithium Project. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. The estimated Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource underpinning the base case production target have been prepared by a Competent Person in accordance with the requirements in the JORC Code.\nThe Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve underpinning the estimated life of mine production under the DFS (production target) have been prepared by a competent person or persons and reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. The entire processing schedule is set out over a period of 27 years, which comprises Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource (~75.5%) and Inferred Mineral Resource (~24.5%). The production target set out in this DFS covers the initial 23 years of the Processing Schedule and is based on 88% inventory within the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources category, with 12% being classified within the Inferred Mineral Resources category. The Company has not included years 24 to 27 of the production schedule in the DFS as they are entirely based on inventory in the Inferred Mineral Resources category. There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources, return the same grade and tonnage distribution, or that the production target itself would be realised. Of the Mineral Resource scheduled for extraction in this production target, ~54% is classified as Probable Ore Reserve and ~19% is classified as Proved Ore Reserve. The stated production target is based on the Company's current expectations of the future results or events and should not be solely relied upon by investors when making investing decisions. Further evaluation work and appropriate studies are required to establish sufficient confidence that this target will be met. The proportion of Inferred Mineral Resource is not a determining factor for viability of the Project.\nThe economic outcomes associated with the DFS are based on certain assumptions made for commodity prices, concentrate treatment and recovery charges, exchange rates and other economic variables, which are not within the Company's control and subject to change from time to time. Changes in such assumptions may have a material impact on economic outcomes.\nTo achieve the range of outcomes indicated in the DFS, debt and equity funding will be required. THE DFS estimates that US$2.164bn in construction capital will be required. Investors should note that there is no certainty that the Geomet s.r.o. may be able to raise the amount of funding when needed and/or reach a Final Investment Decision by the date proposed in the DFS. It is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that may be dilutive to, or otherwise affect the value of EMH's existing shares. It is also possible that Geomet s.r.o. could pursue other 'value realisation' strategies such as a sale or partial sale of the Company's share of the Project.\nThis announcement contains forward\u2010looking statements and forecast financial information. including the use of a flat US$26,000/t lithium carbonate price, the production target set out in the PFS and the financial information on which it is based. The basis for that conclusion is contained throughout this announcement and all material assumptions, including the JORC modifying factors, upon which the forward looking statements and forecast financial information are based, are disclosed in this announcement. However, such forecasts, projections and information are not a guarantee of future performance and involve unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and developments will almost certainly differ materially from those expressed or implied. There are a number of risks, both specific to EMH, and of a general nature, which may affect the future operating and financial performance of EMH, and the value of an investment in EMH including and not limited to title risk, renewal risk, economic conditions, stock market fluctuations, commodity demand and price movements, timing of access to infrastructure, timing of environmental approvals, regulatory risks, operational risks, reliance on key personnel, Reserve estimations, cultural resources risks, foreign currency fluctuations, and mining development, construction and commissioning risks. It should be noted that the NPV break even lithium/carbonate price is approximately US$20,500/t\nand that the Shanghai Metal Markets Lithium Carbonate Index (Battery Grade), delivered to China, VAT inclusive price is US$12,264/t from as at 19 November 2025\nGiven the uncertainties involved, investors should not make any investment decisions based solely on the results of the DFS.\nINTRODUCTION & DFS BACKGROUND\nThe Definitive Feasibility Study (\nDFS\n) for the Cinovec Lithium Project represents the culmination of more than a decade of combined geological, metallurgical, environmental, mining and engineering work undertaken by European Metals and the project operating company, Geomet s.r.o. The DFS has been prepared by DRA Global (processing, including Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation and Lithium Chemical Plant), Bara Consulting (mining) other specialist engineering groups (Dukla bulk materials handling hub, infrastructure) and multiple Czech and international environmental, permitting and logistics consultants.\nThe DFS consolidates:\n\u00b7\nUp-to-date geological interpretation supported by additional diamond drilling.\n\u00b7\nExpanded metallurgical programs including locked-cycle flotation campaigns and sustained pilot-scale operation of the downstream lithium chemical process.\n\u00b7\nMine design and geotechnical modelling incorporating both historical mining data and contemporary laboratory testing.\n\u00b7\nDFS level engineering for the aerial conveyor system, Dukla bulk materials handling hub, Prun\u00e9\u0159ov beneficiation plant (\nFECAB\n), Prun\u00e9\u0159ov Lithium Chemical Plant (\nLCP\n), backfill paste plant and Doly N\u00e1stup Tu\u0161imice open pit coal mine (\nDNT\n) tailings storage facility.\n\u00b7\nDFS level Hydrogeological, hydrological, biodiversity, noise, vibration, air quality and visual modelling which will be utilised as part of a unified Environmental Impact Assessment (\nEIA\n).\n\u00b7\nA full Project Execution Plan (\nPEP\n), risk assessment, cost estimation, and implementation scheduling.\nThe DFS demonstrates that Cinovec is technically feasible, economically robust and strategically aligned with the European Union's objectives to internalise the supply chain for battery-grade lithium chemicals. The study confirms that all components of the proposed vertically integrated operation - from underground mining through to lithium carbonate packaging - can be constructed and operated entirely within the Czech Republic, providing security of supply to European EV and energy-storage markets.\nKEY PROJECT METRICS\nKey Metrics\nMeasured, Indicated and Inferred Resources (Mt)\n747.54\nProved and Probable Ore Reserves (Mt)\n54.40\nMine Life (Years)\n22.6\nProduction Life (Years)\n20.3\nAnnual Crusher Feed (tonnes per annum)\n3.2M\nTotal Ore - Li Grade\n0.27%\nLi2CO3 - Life of Mine Tonnes\n869,941\nFirst 5 Full Production Years\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nYear 5\nOre Mined (million tonnes)\n2.54\n2.86\n3.20\n3.20\n3.21\nOre Grade (% Li\u2082O)\n0.57%\n0.59%\n0.59%\n0.59%\n0.62%\nOre Grade (%Li)\n0.265%\n0.272%\n0.273%\n0.276%\n0.287%\nLi2CO3 Tonnes per annum\n28,824\n33,583\n37,580\n38,010\n39,747\nProject Economics (Real)\nCosts (USD)\nLOM (000's)\nLi2CO3/t\nTotal C1 Costs\n9,243,496\n12,261\nAll-in-Sustaining Cost\n10,164,579\n13,879\nInitial Capex\n2,164,880\n2,489\nApproved Grants (US 000's)\nCombined Government and Just Transition Fund\n463,008\nInitial Capex - Grants\n1,701,872\nSustaining Capex\n498,710\n573\nCashflow (USD)\nWith Grant\nWithout Grant\nPrice for Li2CO3 (USD /Tonne)\n26,000\n26,000\nLOM Gross Revenue (000's)\n19,042,009\n19,042,009\nLOM EBITDA (000's)\n9,353,777\n9,353,777\nPre Tax NPV (8% Disc.

The sensitivity analyses have been performed using a post-tax (nominal) discount rate of 8% with each variable as follows flexed \u00b1X% using the midpoint price range applied as the central case. The central case assumes a Lithium Carbonate price of US$26,000/t\u00a0real\u00a0and results in an NPV of US$1,715M\u00a0at an 8%\u00a0pre-tax, nominal discount rate, with grant allowances included.\nFigure 3 Graph of the mine production profile by resource category\nProject Funding Sources and Strategy\nEMH\nis well placed\u00a0being in partnership with CEZ, a major Czech semi-government company, and together having attracted significant European grant funding. Post this funding, the Board will continue to minimalise dilution at the corporate level as it focuses on funding alternatives at the project level. Geomet, being the project company for Cinovec, will be primarily responsible for raising the early stage funds with the majority being required towards the end of 2026. The partners are in advanced discussion with various parties with a view to provide\u00a0funding to cover this requirement.\nGiven the technical and economic viability demonstrated by the Feasibility Study, the Company has reasonable grounds to believe the Project could be financed via a combination of debt and equity.\nFollowing the completion of the DFS, the Company will seek to formalise the ongoing discussions with potential debt or equity institutions. The Company expects debt could potentially be secured from a range of sources including European banks (eg EIB/KFW), Australian banks, European critical minerals funds, resource credit funds, export credit agencies, Government agencies and in conjunction with product sales or offtake agreements. The viability of the Project is enhanced by having a joint venture partner in the CEZ Group and the very clear political and economic support of the Czech Government and European Union, which will assist in negotiations for debt and equity.\nThe Company may also consider commencing a formal strategic partnering process whereby alternative funding options, including undertaking a corporate transaction, a joint venture partnership, a partial asset sale and/or offtake pre-payment could be undertaken if it maximises shareholder value over the long term.\nThe Company has maintained close contact with a number of potential offtakers in Europe and globally during the course of development of the DFS. Discussions with these parties will now be formalised.\nThe support of the Czech Government in the grant award is confirmation that the Cinovec Project is a foundation stone enabling the development of downstream industries, expected to bring significant industrial partners to invest in Czechia, whether in the Cinovec Project itself or the enabled Pre-CAM, CAM, Li-ion battery or BEV industries.\nThere is no certainty that the Company will be able to source funding as and when required. It is also possible that required funding may only be available on terms that may be dilutive to or otherwise affect the value of the Company's existing shares.\nThe Company has formed the view that there is a reasonable basis to believe that requisite future funding for development of the Project will be available when required based on the following:\n\u00b7\nEMH has a market capitalisation of approximately A$80 million and a strong track record of raising equity funding for the advancement of the Project. Approximately A$61.7M has been raised from sophisticated investors, brokers and existing shareholders, and used to advance its share of the Cinovec project;\n\u00b7\nThe Project is Critical to European critical mineral security, with proven mining and straightforward processing methods and, once in operation, will be a significant source of lithium carbonate outside China;\n\u00b7\nDemand growth for lithium is expected to be strong and funding for high-quality resource projects delivering production of this metal is likely to be available. The Project has the potential to become a top-tier lithium carbonate producer within the EU and provide a strategically certain supply of lithium carbonate to gigafactories and OEM automotive suppliers all located within the European jurisdiction, which is expected to attract a range of financiers and partners;\n\u00b7\nEconomic viability at this early stage of the Project, in a range of scenarios, has been demonstrated by strong free cashflow and a capital investment payback period of 7 years as outlined in the Feasibility Study.\n\u00b7\nVulcan Energy has recently completed a fund raising for a lithium battery metal project of similar size and with a similar NPV and was able to attract a debt package of \u20ac1,185m (A$2,116m) in senior debt funding by a syndicate of 13 financial institutions comprising the European Investment Bank, five Export Credit Agencies and seven commercial banks.\n\u00b7\nVulcan Energy also raised:\n(1) \u20ac204m in German government grants\n(2) \u20ac150m equity investment in Vulcan's primary German holding subsidiary, Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH (GermanSubCo), by the KfW Raw Materials Fund (KfW) to acquire a 14% interest in GermanSubCo\n(3) \u20ac133m investment by a consortium of strategic investors comprising HOCHTIEF, Siemens Financial Services and Demeter to acquire a 15% equity interest in the Phase One Lionheart project entity With HOCHTIEF and Siemen being involved in the construction and development of the Project.\nNEXT STEPS\nWith the DFS now complete, European Metals will proceed with the following key workstreams and accelerate Cinovec's development:\nEU & Czech Government Engagement\nThe Company will advance discussions regarding:\n\u00b7\nAdditional EU-level grant funding\n\u00b7\nStrategic debt facilities from European Investment Bank (\nEIB\n), Export Credit Agencies (\nECAs\n) and other supranational lenders\n\u00b7\nAccess to Critical Raw Materials Act (\nCRMA\n)-backed financing mechanisms\n\u00b7\nCzech co-funding structures and regional development incentives\nProject Financing\nThe DFS provides the foundation for:\n\u00b7\nFormal engagement with commercial lenders\n\u00b7\nDue diligence by commercial lenders, EIB, ECAs and other supranational lenders\n\u00b7\nEvaluation of strategic partners for equity and project-level funding\n\u00b7\nFinancial structuring scenarios that optimise cost of capital\nOff-Take Agreements\nThe Company is engaged in\u00a0advanced discussions\u00a0with:\n\u00b7\nMajor Czech and European battery manufacturers\n\u00b7\nCathode active material producers\n\u00b7\nAutomotive OEMs\nWith DFS parameters finalised, these discussions will progress to:\n\u00b7\nBinding term sheets\n\u00b7\nVolumetric commitments\n\u00b7\nMulti-year supply agreements\n\u00b7\nTechnical qualification programmes\nEnvironmental & Permitting\n\u00b7\nSubmission of the\u00a0Unified EIA\n\u00b7\nFinalisation of land-use and construction permits for all sites\n\u00b7\nFinalisation of water, waste, air, and operational approvals\n\u00b7\nOngoing Natura 2000 and Protected Landscape Area consultations\nCinovec's location within the EU provides a significant competitive advantage for off-take partners seeking secure domestic supply.\nPreparation for Final Investment Decision (FID)\nFID-enabling activities include:\n\u00b7\nCompletion of front-end engineering and design (\nFEED\n) (including contract for EPCM partner)\n\u00b7\nEarly works packages (clearing, utilities, geotechnical groundwork)\n\u00b7\nContractor prequalification\n\u00b7\nDetailed project execution modelling\n\u00b7\nCompletion of full financing package\nDFS OVERVIEW\nPROJECT LOCATION & STRATEGIC CONTEXT\nCinovec is located in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region of northern Czech Republic, near the German border, and within 200-350 km of multiple operating or announced European gigafactories.\nThe Project in its entirety comprises of 6 distinctive interconnected elements,\n(See Figure 3)\nnamely:\n1. Underground mine and associated surface infrastructure at a portal site, located close to Cinovec village on the Czechia / German border.\n2. Aerial Conveyor System (\nACS\n) ore transportation link running approximately 7.3km between the mine portal and an ore transfer station located at Dukla.\n3. Transfer station located at the Dukla industrial site where ore is transferred from the ACS to rail and tailings material from the processing plant, destined for backfill into the mine, is transferred to the ACS to be returned to the backfill paste plant at the mine portal.\n4. Rail link running 65 km between the transfer station and the processing plant.\n5. The processing plant at Prunerov.\n6. Tailings disposal site located on previously mined land at the Doly\nN\u00e1stup Tu\u0161imice\ncoal mine (\nDNT\n) approximately 7.5km (via road) to the east of the processing plant.\nThe Project is positioned in one of Europe's most industrially developed regions, offering:\n\u00b7\nMining construction, engineering and existing heavy industrial infrastructure and skills base experience.\n\u00b7\nStrong rail, road, water and energy infrastructure.\n\u00b7\nProximity to major EV and battery manufacturing projects in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe.\n\u00b7\nSupportive state and municipal frameworks, with the Czech Republic designating Cinovec as a\u00a0Strategic Deposit.\n\u00b7\nEU-level support through the CRMA, recognising Cinovec as a\u00a0Strategic Project\n[6]\n.\nCinovec therefore sits at the nexus of supply, demand and policy alignment. Its location reduces logistics risk, minimises shipment emissions, and positions the Project as a cornerstone of Europe's push to secure critical minerals within the EU.\nFigure 4: Cinovec's key project components\nGEOLOGY & MINERALISATION\nGeological Setting\nCinovec is a greisen-hosted lithium mica deposit formed within a series of granitic intrusions. The lithium mineralisation occurs primarily within zinnwaldite-rich greisen zones that exhibit:\n\u00b7\nBroad lateral continuity\n\u00b7\nSignificant thicknesses (commonly 20-100 m)\n\u00b7\nPredictable mineralogical behaviour\n\u00b7\nFavourable geotechnical conditions for large-scale underground mining\nFigure 5:\nLongitudinal Section across the C\u00ednovec deposit\nHistorical Mining\nCinovec has a long industrial history. Late 20th-century test-mining for tin in the massive Cinovec orebody extracted approximately\u00a0400,000 tonnes\u00a0of lithium-bearing tin ore from small-scale test stopes, after the high tin grade hydrothermal veins coming off the massive orebody had been largely exhausted over the previous decades. This has left a legacy of drives, stopes and chambers and a wealth of geological data. The historical workings have provided:\n\u00b7\nReal-world geotechnical validation\n\u00b7\nEmpirical data for rock-mass behaviour\n\u00b7\nProven suitability of Sub-Level Open Stoping (\nSLOS\n)\nThese historical data sets significantly reduce uncertainty in the DFS mine design. The planned mine production will not mine through these historical areas, which are located above the DFS mining levels.\nMineralogical Characteristics\nThe dominant lithium mineral is\u00a0zinnwaldite, a lithium-bearing mica with consistent metallurgical behaviour. The DFS incorporates extensive mineralogical characterisation to:\n\u00b7\nDefine metallurgical domains\n\u00b7\nPredict flotation and LCP response\n\u00b7\nSupport recovery assumptions across the mine life\nRESOURCE MODEL & RESERVE BASIS\nDrilling & Data Inputs\nThe DFS incorporates data from:\n\u00b7\nHistorical drilling\n\u00b7\nExtensive new drilling by European Metals\n\u00b7\nUnderground sampling from historical workings\n\u00b7\n8.5 tonnes of bulk metallurgical samples for FECAB testwork and LCP pilot campaigns\nThe dataset supports a high-confidence geological and resource model.\nFigure 6:\nLocations of the drilling at Cinovec on aerial map\nResource Estimate\nThe DFS Mineral Resource estimate comprises:\n\u00b7\n748 Mt @ 0.19% Li\n\u00b7\nContaining\u00a07.45 Mt LCE\nA substantial portion is classified as Measured or Indicated, supporting DFS-level mining and processing assumptions.\nOre Reserve\nThe DFS mine plan is underpinned by a robust Ore Reserve that supports production in the first 22 years of the full LOM 26-year\u00a0operating schedule (which included the inferred resources). Additional blocks defined within the Resource but not yet incorporated into the Reserve represent clear expansion potential beyond the base case.\nReserve estimation incorporates:\n\u00b7\nGeotechnical constraints\n\u00b7\nMining method and design envelopes\n\u00b7\nMining modifying factors\n\u00b7\nMetallurgical recoveries\n\u00b7\nEconomic cut-off grade modelling\nSupporting Metallurgical Testwork\nExtensive metallurgical testwork using core and development rock to support and validate:\n\u00b7\nMineralogy, lithology and liberation properties\n\u00b7\nComminution characteristics\n\u00b7\nFlotation separation efficiency in terms of concentrate grade and lithium recoveries\n\u00b7\nDewatering of concentrates and tailings\nBulk core samples from drilling were processed to produce sufficient concentrate for downstream pilot testwork, validating:\n\u00b7\nLCP extraction efficiency\n\u00b7\nImpurity deportment characteristics\nThis metallurgical dataset provides the technical foundation for both the beneficiation (FECAB) and LCP recovery assumptions adopted in the DFS.\nMINING ENGINEERING & MINE DESIGN\nThe DFS mine design reflects the combined geological, geotechnical and operational characteristics of the Cinovec deposit. The study adopts\u00a0SLOS\u00a0with cemented paste-fill, supported by a robust geotechnical model informed by laboratory testing, historical mining data and numerical simulation.\nMining Method Selection\nSLOS was selected following evaluation of multiple underground mining methods including room-and-pillar, cut-and-fill and drift-and-fill. Key reasons for selecting SLOS include:\n\u00b7\nOrebody geometry:\u00a0Cinovec's thick, laterally continuous greisen zones are highly suited to bulk, long-hole stoping.\n\u00b7\nRock mass competency:\u00a0Laboratory and in situ testing confirm favourable rock-mass conditions.\n\u00b7\nHistorical mine performance:\u00a0Previous workings used variants of sub-level stoping with strong stability outcomes.\n\u00b7\nProductivity & cost:\u00a0SLOS achieves the required mining rate of\u00a0~3.2 Mtpa\u00a0at competitive operating cost.\n\u00b7\nPaste-fill compatibility:\u00a0Large voids created by SLOS can be safely backfilled, enabling high extraction and geotechnical stability.\nFigure 7: Underground Infrastructure - Looking North-Northeast\nStope Geometry & Design Parameters\nStandard stope dimensions are optimised for stability, productivity and minimal dilution.\n\u00b7\nStope height:\u00a020 m\n\u00b7\nStope width:\u00a016 m\n\u00b7\nStope length:\u00a0Up to 50 m\n\u00b7\nMining blocks:\u00a0Four stopes vertically \u00d7 five stopes horizontally, forming 80 \u00d7 80 m blocks\n\u00b7\nRib pillars:\u00a010 m\n\u00b7\nSill pillars:\u00a06 m (11 m total with ore access drives)\nFigure 8:\nNominal Sub-Level Stope Block & Pillar Arrangement\nMini-SLOS Stopes\nCertain mineralised zones require reduced stope height to maintain stability and improve recovery:\n\u00b7\nHeight:\u00a07 m\n\u00b7\nApplication:\u00a0Flatter or thinner ore zones\n\u00b7\nOutcome:\u00a0Increased recovery of marginal domains without compromising safety\nMine Layout & Infrastructure\nThe mine is accessed via a Twin Decline System:\n\u00b7\nOne decline dedicated to vehicle access, services, water, power distribution, ventilation intake\n\u00b7\nOne decline dedicated to the conveyor, forming the mine's primary materials handling backbone\nFigure 9: Twin decline system\nInternal Mine Development\n\u00b7\nSpiral ramps accessing multiple mining horizons\n\u00b7\nOre drives positioned on sub-levels\n\u00b7\nCross-cuts enabling multiple operating fronts\n\u00b7\nVentilation raises and emergency egress\nFigure 10: Access ramps / Drives and LHOS / Rib Pillar Ore Drives\nVentilation & Airflow Modelling\nThe mine uses a push-pull ventilation system designed to:\n\u00b7\nMaintain statutory airflow\n\u00b7\nControl dust and diesel particulates\n\u00b7\nProvide redundancy for fan outages\n\u00b7\nOperate under varying seasonal temperature conditions\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling is integrated into the DFS.\nProduction Schedule\nThe DFS production plan is structured to provide:\n\u00b7\nEarly development ore\u00a0for commissioning\n\u00b7\nRamp-up to full production\u00a0over multiple years\n\u00b7\nSteady-state ore production:\u00a0~3.2 Mtpa\n\u00b7\nMultiple mining fronts to maintain schedule resilience\n\u00b7\nOptimised sequencing for geotechnical stability and paste-fill curing\nPaste-fill System\nPaste-fill forms a critical part of the mine design.\nPaste-fill characteristics:\n\u00b7\nBlend of tailings, cement and water\n\u00b7\nEngineered to achieve required strength and curing performance\n\u00b7\nReturned underground via the rail and subsequently via the aerial conveyor system\nBenefits:\n\u00b7\nMaximises ore extraction\n\u00b7\nMinimises surface tailings footprint\n\u00b7\nEnhances ground stability\n\u00b7\nReduces long-term geotechnical risk\nMATERIALS HANDLING & LOGISTICS\nCinovec employs an integrated materials-handling system linking underground operations with surface processing infrastructure.\nUnderground Crushing & Conveyor Feed\nPrimary and secondary crushing underground reduces ore to <83 mm, enabling efficient feeding to the conveyor decline.

The Project sits within 200-350 km of several gigafactories either operating, under construction, or planned within the EU and can benefit from its proximity to a large share of automotive industry entities (OEMs) in Central Europe with 22 car manufacturing plants within 400 km of Prague with over 8 million vehicles manufactured in the area annually.\nFigure 1: Cinovec's location with proximity to gigafactories/OEMs either operating, under construction, or planned within the EU\nExecutive Chairman\u00a0Keith Coughlan\u00a0said:\n\"The DFS confirms Cinovec as one of Europe's most advanced and strategically significant lithium projects. With strong economics, central location and substantial government backing - including approval for up to EUR 360 million in Czech Government grant funding - the Project is uniquely positioned to supply long-term lithium carbonate into the European battery and EV sectors.\nEMH\nis well placed\u00a0being in partnership with CEZ, a major Czech semi-government company, and together having attracted significant European grant funding. Post this funding, the Board will continue to minimise dilution at the corporate level as it focuses on funding alternatives at the project level. Geomet, being the project company for Cinovec, will be primarily responsible for raising the early-stage funds with the majority being required towards the end of 2026. The partners are in advanced discussion with various parties with a view to provide\u00a0funding to cover this requirement.\nWith the DFS now released, we are advancing discussions with EU institutions regarding additional grants and strategic debt, progressing project financing with commercial lenders and potential strategic partners and moving toward the completion of off-take agreements, which are already at an advanced stage with major European battery and automotive groups. These steps collectively position Cinovec for a final investment decision.\"\nINTRODUCTION & DFS BACKGROUND\nThe Definitive Feasibility Study (\nDFS\n) for the Cinovec Lithium Project represents the culmination of more than a decade of combined geological, metallurgical, environmental, mining and engineering work undertaken by European Metals and the project operating company, Geomet s.r.o. The DFS has been prepared by DRA Global (processing, including Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation and Lithium Chemical Plant), Bara Consulting (mining) other specialist engineering groups (Dukla bulk materials handling hub, infrastructure) and multiple Czech and international environmental, permitting and logistics consultants.\nThe DFS consolidates:\n\u00b7\nUp-to-date geological interpretation supported by additional diamond drilling.\n\u00b7\nExpanded metallurgical programs including locked-cycle flotation campaigns and sustained pilot-scale operation of the downstream lithium chemical process.\n\u00b7\nMine design and geotechnical modelling incorporating both historical mining data and contemporary laboratory testing.\n\u00b7\nDFS level engineering for the aerial conveyor system, Dukla bulk materials handling hub, Prun\u00e9\u0159ov beneficiation plant (\nFECAB\n), Prun\u00e9\u0159ov Lithium Chemical Plant (\nLCP\n), backfill paste plant and Doly N\u00e1stup Tu\u0161imice open pit coal mine (\nDNT\n) tailings storage facility.\n\u00b7\nDFS level Hydrogeological, hydrological, biodiversity, noise, vibration, air quality and visual modelling which will be utilised as part of a unified Environmental Impact Assessment (\nEIA\n).\n\u00b7\nA full Project Execution Plan (\nPEP\n), risk assessment, cost estimation, and implementation scheduling.\nThe DFS demonstrates that Cinovec is technically feasible, economically robust and strategically aligned with the European Union's objectives to internalise the supply chain for battery-grade lithium chemicals. The study confirms that all components of the\nproposed vertically integrated operation - from underground mining through to lithium carbonate packaging - can be constructed and operated entirely within the Czech Republic, providing security of supply to European EV and energy-storage markets.\nKEY PROJECT METRICS\nKey Metrics\nMeasured, Indicated and Inferred Resources (Mt)\n747.54\nProved and Probable Ore Reserves (Mt)\n54.40\nMine Life (Years)\n27.5\nProduction Life (Years)\n25.17\nAnnual Crusher Feed (tonnes per annum)\n3.2M\nTotal Ore - Li Grade\n0.27%\nLi2CO3 - Life of Mine Tonnes\n869,941\nFirst 5 Full Production Years\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nYear 5\nOre Mined (million tonnes)\n2.54\n2.86\n3.20\n3.20\n3.21\nOre Grade (% Li\u2082O)\n0.57%\n0.59%\n0.59%\n0.59%\n0.62%\nOre Grade (%Li)\n0.265%\n0.272%\n0.273%\n0.276%\n0.287%\nLi2CO3 Tonnes per annum\n28,824\n33,583\n37,580\n38,010\n39,747\nProject Economics (Real)\nCosts (USD)\nLOM (000's)\nLi2CO3/t\nTotal C1 Costs\n10,863,328\n12,492\nAll-in-Sustaining Cost\n11,890,115\n13,673\nInitial Capex\n2,164,880\n2,489\nApproved Grants (US 000's)\nCombined Government and Just Transition Fund\n463,008\nInitial Capex - Grants\n1,701,872\nSustaining Capex\n498,710\n573\nCashflow (USD)\nWith Grant\nWithout Grant\nPrice for Li2CO3 (USD /Tonne)\n26,000\n26,000\nLOM Gross Revenue (000's)\n22,610,448\n22,610,448\nLOM EBITDA (000's)\n11,219,043\n11,219,043\nPre Tax NPV (8% Disc.

The sensitivity analyses have been performed using a post-tax (nominal) discount rate of 8% with each variable as follows flexed \u00b1X% using the midpoint price range applied as the central case. The central case assumes a Lithium Carbonate price of US$26,000/t\u00a0real\u00a0and results in an NPV of US$1,715M\u00a0at an 8%\u00a0pre-tax, nominal discount rate, with grant allowances included.\nFigure 3 Graph of the mine production profile by resource category\nProject Funding Sources and Strategy\nEMH\nis well placed\u00a0being in partnership with CEZ, a major Czech semi-government company, and together having attracted significant European grant funding. Post this funding, the Board will continue to minimalise dilution at the corporate level as it focuses on funding alternatives at the project level. Geomet, being the project company for Cinovec, will be primarily responsible for raising the early stage funds with the majority being required towards the end of 2026. The partners are in advanced discussion with various parties with a view to provide\u00a0funding to cover this requirement.\nGiven the technical and economic viability demonstrated by the Feasibility Study, the Company has reasonable grounds to believe the Project could be financed via a combination of debt and equity.\nFollowing the completion of the DFS, the Company will seek to formalise the ongoing discussions with potential debt or equity institutions. The Company expects debt could potentially be secured from a range of sources including European banks (eg EIB/KFW), Australian banks, European critical minerals funds, resource credit funds, export credit agencies, Government agencies and in conjunction with product sales or offtake agreements. The viability of the Project is enhanced by having a joint venture partner in the CEZ Group and the very clear political and economic support of the Czech Government and European Union, which will assist in negotiations for debt and equity.\nThe Company may also consider commencing a formal strategic partnering process whereby alternative funding options, including undertaking a corporate transaction, a joint venture partnership, a partial asset sale and/or offtake pre-payment could be undertaken if it maximises shareholder value over the long term.\nThe Company has maintained close contact with a number of potential offtakers in Europe and globally during the course of development of the DFS. Discussions with these parties will now be formalised.\nThe support of the Czech Government in the grant award is confirmation that the Cinovec Project is a foundation stone enabling the development of downstream industries, expected to bring significant industrial partners to invest in Czechia, whether in the Cinovec Project itself or the enabled Pre-CAM, CAM, Li-ion battery or BEV industries.\nThere is no certainty that the Company will be able to source funding as and when required. It is also possible that required funding may only be available on terms that may be dilutive to or otherwise affect the value of the Company's existing shares.\nThe Company has formed the view that there is a reasonable basis to believe that requisite future funding for development of the Project will be available when required based on the following:\n\u00b7\nEMH has a market capitalisation of approximately A$80 million and a strong track record of raising equity funding for the advancement of the Project. Approximately A$61.7M has been raised from sophisticated investors, brokers and existing shareholders, and used to advance its share of the Cinovec project;\n\u00b7\nThe Project is Critical to European critical mineral security, with proven mining and straightforward processing methods and, once in operation, will be a significant source of lithium carbonate outside China;\n\u00b7\nDemand growth for lithium is expected to be strong and funding for high-quality resource projects delivering production of this metal is likely to be available. The Project has the potential to become a top-tier lithium carbonate producer within the EU and provide a strategically certain supply of lithium carbonate to gigafactories and OEM automotive suppliers all located within the European jurisdiction, which is expected to attract a range of financiers and partners;\n\u00b7\nEconomic viability at this early stage of the Project, in a range of scenarios, has been demonstrated by strong free cashflow and a capital investment payback period of 7 years as outlined in the Feasibility Study.\n\u00b7\nVulcan Energy has recently completed a fund raising for a lithium battery metal project of similar size and with a similar NPV and was able to attract a debt package of \u20ac1,185m (A$2,116m) in senior debt funding by a syndicate of 13 financial institutions comprising the European Investment Bank, five Export Credit Agencies and seven commercial banks.\n\u00b7\nVulcan Energy also raised:\n(1) \u20ac204m in German government grants\n(2) \u20ac150m equity investment in Vulcan's primary German holding subsidiary, Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH (GermanSubCo), by the KfW Raw Materials Fund (KfW) to acquire a 14% interest in GermanSubCo\n(3) \u20ac133m investment by a consortium of strategic investors comprising HOCHTIEF, Siemens Financial Services and Demeter to acquire a 15% equity interest in the Phase One Lionheart project entity With HOCHTIEF and Siemen being involved in the construction and development of the Project.\nNEXT STEPS\nWith the DFS now complete, European Metals will proceed with the following key workstreams and accelerate Cinovec's development:\nEU & Czech Government Engagement\nThe Company will advance discussions regarding:\n\u00b7\nAdditional EU-level grant funding\n\u00b7\nStrategic debt facilities from European Investment Bank (\nEIB\n), Export Credit Agencies (\nECAs\n) and other supranational lenders\n\u00b7\nAccess to Critical Raw Materials Act (\nCRMA\n)-backed financing mechanisms\n\u00b7\nCzech co-funding structures and regional development incentives\nProject Financing\nThe DFS provides the foundation for:\n\u00b7\nFormal engagement with commercial lenders\n\u00b7\nDue diligence by commercial lenders, EIB, ECAs and other supranational lenders\n\u00b7\nEvaluation of strategic partners for equity and project-level funding\n\u00b7\nFinancial structuring scenarios that optimise cost of capital\nOff-Take Agreements\nThe Company is engaged in\u00a0advanced discussions\u00a0with:\n\u00b7\nMajor Czech and European battery manufacturers\n\u00b7\nCathode active material producers\n\u00b7\nAutomotive OEMs\nWith DFS parameters finalised, these discussions will progress to:\n\u00b7\nBinding term sheets\n\u00b7\nVolumetric commitments\n\u00b7\nMulti-year supply agreements\n\u00b7\nTechnical qualification programmes\nEnvironmental & Permitting\n\u00b7\nSubmission of the\u00a0Unified EIA\n\u00b7\nFinalisation of land-use and construction permits for all sites\n\u00b7\nFinalisation of water, waste, air, and operational approvals\n\u00b7\nOngoing Natura 2000 and Protected Landscape Area consultations\nCinovec's location within the EU provides a significant competitive advantage for off-take partners seeking secure domestic supply.\nPreparation for Final Investment Decision (FID)\nFID-enabling activities include:\n\u00b7\nCompletion of front-end engineering and design (\nFEED\n) (including contract for EPCM partner)\n\u00b7\nEarly works packages (clearing, utilities, geotechnical groundwork)\n\u00b7\nContractor prequalification\n\u00b7\nDetailed project execution modelling\n\u00b7\nCompletion of full financing package\nDFS OVERVIEW\nPROJECT LOCATION & STRATEGIC CONTEXT\nCinovec is located in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region of northern Czech Republic, near the German border, and within 200-350 km of multiple operating or announced Europeangigafactories.\nThe Project in its entirety comprises of 6 distinctive interconnected elements,\n(See Figure 3)\nnamely:\n1. Underground mine and associated surface infrastructure at a portal site, located close to Cinovec village on the Czechia / German border.\n2. Aerial Conveyor System (\nACS\n) ore transportation link running approximately 7.3km between the mine portal and an ore transfer station located at Dukla.\n3. Transfer station located at the Dukla industrial site where ore is transferred from the ACS to rail and tailings material from the processing plant, destined for backfill into the mine, is transferred to the ACS to be returned to the backfill paste plant at the mine portal.\n4. Rail link running 65 km between the transfer station and the processing plant.\n5. The processing plant at Prunerov.\n6. Tailings disposal site located on previously mined land at the Doly\nN\u00e1stup Tu\u0161imice\ncoal mine (\nDNT\n) approximately 7.5km (via road) to the east of the processing plant.\nThe Project is positioned in one of Europe's most industrially developed regions, offering:\n\u00b7\nMining construction, engineering and existing heavy industrial infrastructure and skills base experience.\n\u00b7\nStrong rail, road, water and energy infrastructure.\n\u00b7\nProximity to major EV and battery manufacturing projects in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe.\n\u00b7\nSupportive state and municipal frameworks, with the Czech Republic designating Cinovec as a\u00a0Strategic Deposit.\n\u00b7\nEU-level support through the CRMA, recognising Cinovec as a\u00a0Strategic Project\n[4]\n.\nCinovec therefore sits at the nexus of supply, demand and policy alignment. Its location reduces logistics risk, minimises shipment emissions, and positions the Project as a cornerstone of Europe's push to secure critical minerals within the EU.\nFigure 4: Cinovec's key project components\nGEOLOGY & MINERALISATION\nGeological Setting\nCinovec is a greisen-hosted lithium mica deposit formed within a series of granitic intrusions. The lithium mineralisation occurs primarily within zinnwaldite-rich greisen zones that exhibit:\n\u00b7\nBroad lateral continuity\n\u00b7\nSignificant thicknesses (commonly 20-100 m)\n\u00b7\nPredictable mineralogical behaviour\n\u00b7\nFavourable geotechnical conditions for large-scale underground mining\nFigure 5:\nLongitudinal Section across the C\u00ednovec deposit\nHistorical Mining\nCinovec has a long industrial history. Late 20th-century test-mining for tin in the massive Cinovec orebody extracted approximately\u00a0400,000 tonnes\u00a0of lithium-bearing tin ore from small-scale test stopes, after the high tin grade hydrothermal veins coming off the massive orebody had been largely exhausted over the previous decades. This has left a legacy of drives, stopes and chambers and a wealth of geological data. The historical workings have provided:\n\u00b7\nReal-world geotechnical validation\n\u00b7\nEmpirical data for rock-mass behaviour\n\u00b7\nProven suitability of Sub-Level Open Stoping (\nSLOS\n)\nThese historical data sets significantly reduce uncertainty in the DFS mine design. The planned mine production will not mine through these historical areas, which are located above the DFS mining levels.\nMineralogical Characteristics\nThe dominant lithium mineral is\u00a0zinnwaldite, a lithium-bearing mica with consistent metallurgical behaviour. The DFS incorporates extensive mineralogical characterisation to:\n\u00b7\nDefine metallurgical domains\n\u00b7\nPredict flotation and LCP response\n\u00b7\nSupport recovery assumptions across the mine life\nRESOURCE MODEL & RESERVE BASIS\nDrilling & Data Inputs\nThe DFS incorporates data from:\n\u00b7\nHistorical drilling\n\u00b7\nExtensive new drilling by European Metals\n\u00b7\nUnderground sampling from historical workings\n\u00b7\n8.5 tonnes of bulk metallurgical samples for FECAB testwork and LCP pilot campaigns\nThe dataset supports a high-confidence geological and resource model.\nFigure 6:\nLocations of the drilling at Cinovec on aerial map\nResource Estimate\nThe DFS Mineral Resource estimate comprises:\n\u00b7\n748 Mt @ 0.19% Li\n\u00b7\nContaining\u00a07.45 Mt LCE\nA substantial portion is classified as Measured or Indicated, supporting DFS-level mining and processing assumptions.\nCinovec Summary of JORC Reserves and JORC Resources\nThis is an Cinovec Project Reserve and Resource update to the prior releases on 13 October 2021 (JORC Resources) and 4 July 2017 (Maiden JORC Reserve)\nCategory\nGross\nNet Attributable to EMH\nOperator\nTonnes\n(mt)\nGrade\n(% Li)\nContained Li metal (t)\nTonnes\n(mt)\nGrade\n(% Li)\nContained Li metal (t)\nReserves\nProven\n14.5\n0.28\n41,000\n7.1\n0.28\n19,900\nGeomet s.r.o.\nProbable\n39.9\n0.26\n104,000\n19.6\n0.26\n50,800\nGeomet s.r.o.\nTotal Reserves\n54.4\n0.27\n145,000\n26.7\n0.27\n70,700\nResources\nMeasured\n59.82\n0.210\n126,000\n29.3\n0.210\n61,600\nGeomet s.r.o.\nIndicated\n378.23\n0.192\n726,000\n185.3\n0.192\n355,800\nGeomet s.r.o.\nInferred\n309.49\n0.176\n545,000\n151.7\n0.176\n266,900\nGeomet s.r.o.\nTotal Resources1\n747.54\n0.187\n1,397,000\n366.3\n0.187\n684,300\nNote 1: Total Resources are reported inclusive of Reserves.\nDefinitions\nIndicated Mineral Resource\nThe part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are sufficiently well established to allow for a reasonable level of confidence in the estimate, but not as high as for Measured Resources.\nInferred Mineral Resource\nThe part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling, resulting in a lower level of confidence.\nLi\nLithium\nMeasured Mineral Resource\nThe part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow for detailed mine planning.\nMineral Resource Estimate/MRE\nThe estimate of mineral resources as calculated and presented in accordance with a minerals code or standard\nMineral Resource\nA concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.

CEZ's core business is the generation, distribution, trade in, and sales of electri\ncity and heat, trade in and sales of natural gas, and coal extraction. The foundation of power generation at CEZ Group are emission-free sources. The CEZ strategy named Clean Energy for Tomorrow is based on ambitious decarbonisation, development of renewable sources and nuclear energy. CEZ announced that it would move forward its climate neutrality commitment by ten years to 2040.\nThe largest shareholder of its parent company, CEZ a.s., is the Czech Republic\u00a0with a stake of approximately 70%. The shares of CEZ a.s. are traded on the Prague and Warsaw stock exchanges and included in the PX and WIG-CEE exchange indices. CEZ's market capitalization is approximately EUR 28.2 billion.\nAs one of the leading Central European power companies, CEZ intends to develop\nseveral projects in areas of\nenergy storage\nand battery manufacturing\nin the Czech Republic and in Central Europe.\nCEZ is also a market leader for E-mobility in the region and has installed and operates a network of EV charging stations throughout Czech Republic. The automotive industry in the Czech Republic is a significant contributor to GDP, and the number of EV's in the country is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.\nDFS Cautionary Statement\nThe DFS discussed herein has been undertaken to explore the technical and economic feasibility of developing the Cinovec Lithium Project to economically and sustainably exploit the Project's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve.\nGeomet s.r.o. controls the mineral exploration licenses awarded by the Czech State over the Cinovec Lithium Project. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. The estimated Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource underpinning the base case production target have been prepared by a Competent Person in accordance with the requirements in the JORC Code.\nThe Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve underpinning the estimated life of mine production under the DFS (production target) have been prepared by a competent person or persons and reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code. The production target comprises Measured and Indicated (~75.5%) and Inferred Mineral Resource (~24.5%). There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the conversion of Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources, return the same grade and tonnage distribution, or that the production target itself will be realised. Of the Mineral Resource scheduled for extraction in this production target, ~54% is classified as Probable Ore Reserve and ~19% is classified as Proved Ore Reserve. The stated production target is based on the Company's current expectations of the future results or events and should not be solely relied upon by investors when making investing decisions. Further evaluation work and appropriate studies are required to establish sufficient confidence that this target will be met. The proportion of Inferred Mineral Resource is not a determining factor for viability of the Project.\nThe economic outcomes associated with the DFS are based on certain assumptions made for commodity prices, concentrate treatment and recovery charges, exchange rates and other economic variables, which are not within the Company's control and subject tochange from time to time. Changes in such assumptions may have a material impact on economic outcomes.\nTo achieve the range of outcomes indicated in the DFS, debt and equity funding will be required. Investors should note that there is no certainty that the Geomet s.r.o. may be able to raise the amount of funding when needed and/or reach a Final Investment Decision by the date proposed in the DFS. It is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that may be dilutive to, or otherwise affect the value of EMH's existing shares.

Geomet has been granted a preliminary mining permit by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. Cinovec hosts a globally significant hard rock lithium deposit with a total Measured Mineral Resource of 53.3Mt at 0.48% Li2O, Indicated Mineral Resource of 360.2Mt at 0.44% Li2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 294.7Mt at 0.39% Li2O containing a combined 7.39 million tonnes Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n13 October 2021\n)\n(\nResource Upgrade at Cinovec Lithium Project\n).\nAn initial Probable Ore Reserve of 34.5Mt at 0.65% Li2O reported 4 July 2017 (\nCinovec Maiden Ore Reserve - Further Information\n) has been declared to cover the first 20 years mining at an output of 22,500tpa of lithium carbonate (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n11 July 2018) (\nCinovec Production Modelled to Increase to 22,500tpa of Lithium Carbonate\n).\nThis makes Cinovec the largest hard rock lithium deposit in Europe and by far the largest hard rock lithium deposit in the European Union.\nCinovec has been designated a Strategic Project by the European Union under the Critical Raw Materials Act\n(refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 25/ 26 March 2025) (\nCinovec declared a Strategic Project under EU Critical Raw Materials Act\n) and a Strategic Deposit by the Czech Government (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 7 March 2025) (\nCinovec declared Strategic Deposit by Czech Government\n).\nThe deposit has previously had over 400,000 tonnes of ore mined as a trial sub-level open stope underground mining operation.\nOn 19 January 2022, EMH provided an update to the 2019 Pre-Feasibility Study (\"\nPFS\n\") Update. It confirmed the deposit is amenable to bulk underground mining (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 19 January 2022) (\nPFS Update delivers outstanding results\n). Metallurgical test-work has produced both battery-grade lithium hydroxide and battery-grade lithium carbonate at excellent recoveries. In February 2023 DRA Global Limited (\"\nDRA\n\") was appointed to complete the Definitive Feasibility Study (\"\nDFS\n\").\nCinovec is centrally located for European end-users and is well serviced by infrastructure, with a sealed road adjacent to the deposit, rail lines located 5 km north and 8 km south of the deposit, and an active 22 kV transmission line running to the historic mine. The deposit lies in an active mining region.\nThe Cinovec processing plant comprises of a Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation circuit (\"\nFECAB\n\") and Lithium Chemical Plant circuit (\"\nLCP\n\") in combination producing Lithium Hydroxide or Lithium Carbonate end products, and will be located on the Prun\u00e9\u0159ov 1 Power Station site located approximately 59 km by rail from the Cinovec mine site.\n(Refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM releases dated 26 April 2024 (\nNew Lithium Plant Site Expected to Improve Project Permitting and Economics\n) and 27 November 2024 (\nCinovec Project Update\n)).\nThe economic viability of Cinovec has been enhanced by the recent push for supply security of critical raw materials for battery production, including the strong increase in demand for lithium globally, and within Europe specifically, as demonstrated by the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act (\"\nCRMA\n\").\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CEZ\nHeadquartered in the Czech Republic, CEZ a.s. is one of the largest companies in the Czech Republic and a leading energy group operating in Western and Central Europe. CEZ's core business is the generation, distribution, trade in, and sales of electri\ncity and heat, trade in and sales of natural gas, and coal extraction.
