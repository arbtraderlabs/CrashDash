This period was an extremely significant one for the Company in the continued development of the globally significant Cinovec Lithium Project (\n\"\nthe Project\n\"\nor\n\"\nCinovec\n\"\n) in the Czech Republic.\nThe two most significant developments in the period were the successful completion of the Definitive Feasibility Study (\"\nDFS\n\"\nor\n\"\nStudy\n\") for the Cinovec Project, and the announcement of the approval of a major grant for the Project in the order of EUR 360 million. Early in January 2026, post quarter end, the Company also announced the submission of the Environmental Impact Assessment, a key requirement in the final permitting and funding process. The combination of these three developments significantly advances the Cinovec Project towards Final Investment Decision and ultimately, production.\nSuccessful completion of Definitive Feasibility Study\nOn 23 December 2025, the Company announced the successful completion of the DFS for the Cinovec Project. The Study confirms Cinovec as a long-life producer of battery grade lithium carbonate with a forecast production of 37,500 tpa. This production rate equates to approximately 5.2% of forecast EU demand in 2030 and sufficient for the production of approximately 1.3 million 60kWh batteries per annum. These numbers underscore the importance of the Cinovec Project in the supply chain for Electric Vehicles in the EU.\nThe Study demonstrated robust economics with a pre-tax NPV8 of USD 1.455bn and a pre-tax IRR of 14.8% based upon the first 23 years of the full life of mine 27-year production schedule, and its completion enables advancement of key workstreams, such as EU stakeholder engagement for additional grant and debt support, formal project financing discussions, and finalisation of advanced off-take negotiations.\nApproval of up to \u20ac360 Million Czech Government Grant\nOn 28 November 2025, the Company made the very significant announcement of the approval of a grant of up to EUR 360 million for the Cinovec Project under the \"Strategic Investments for a Climate-neutral Economy\" programme (\"\nProgramme\n\").\nThe Programme is designed to support significant investments in the production and expansion of equipment, key components, and critical raw materials essential for the transition to a climate-neutral economy. The Programme is aligned with the European Commission's Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework and aims to accelerate economic development and investment in strategic sectors. The approval of such a significant financial contribution further demonstrates the support for and importance of Cinovec in the future of European electromobility.\nFull Environmental Impact Assessment submitted for Cinovec Lithium Project (Post reporting period)\nPost the quarter end, the Company announced that the f\null Environmental Impact Assessment (\"\nEIA\n\"\n) for the Cinovec Lithium Project had been submitted to the Czech Ministry of the Environment (see ASX/AIM Announcement dated 13 January 2026). The submission completes the two-stage EIA process following screening-stage assessment lodged in 2025. It also satisfies a key condition of the EU Just Transition Fund grant.\nThe Company announced the Just Transition Fund (\"\nJTF\n\") grant on 28 April 2025, detailing the conditions of this CZK 800 million (~EUR 33 million) grant and its importance. The grant was approved shortly after the Cinovec Project had been classified as a Strategic Project under the EU Critical Raw Materials Act, and as a Strategic Deposit by the Czech government for the purposes of the Czech Construction Code.\nThe submission of the EIA is a crucial step in the process of the JTF grant. The completion of the DFS coupled with the approval of the EUR 360 million grant and finally the submission of the EIA, now places the Project within sight of final permitting approvals and the commencement of the drawdown of funds under the JTF grant.\nCORPORATE AND ADMINISTRATION\nCapital Raising Subsequent to End of Quarter\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company completed a placement to raise approximately A$3.46 million (before costs) to high net worth and institutional clients of Barclay Wells and Zeus Capital (\"\nPlacement\n\"). Placement proceeds will be applied towards ongoing development of the Cinovec Lithium Project and general working capital (see ASX/AIM announcement dated 21 January 2026).\nChange of Company Secretary\nDuring the quarter, the Company announced the resignation of Ms Sujana Karthik as Company Secretary and the appointment of Ms Carly Terzanidis as Company Secretary, effective 5 November 2025\n(see ASX/AIM announcement dated 5 November 2025).\nQuarterly Cash Flow Report\nIn accordance with the ASX Listing Rules, the Company will also today lodge its cashflow report for the quarter ended 31 December 2025. Cash outflows of $1.22 million were incurred during the quarter in relation to the Cinovec DFS costs, as part of the Company's investment in the Cinovec Lithium Project in the Czech Republic.\nThe Company also executed a short-term loan facility for $750,000 during the quarter, which will be repaid from the funds raised via the recent capital raising subsequent to the end of the quarter.\nThe Company's total cash was $0.43 million as at 31 December 2025, which on a proforma basis after adjusting for receipt of the net proceeds of the Placement in January 2026 amounting to\u00a0$3.29 million and repayment of the loan of $750,000, would amount to $2.97 million cash.\nPayments to related parties\nAs outlined in the attached Appendix 5B (section 6.1), during the quarter approximately $154,000 in payments were made to related parties and their associates for director salaries, consultancy fees, superannuation and other related costs. A portion of these expenses is to be reimbursed directly from Geomet.\nGEOMET TENEMENT SCHEDULE\nTable 1: Geomet Tenements\nPermit\nCode\nDeposit\nInterest at beginning of Quarter\nAcquired / Disposed\nInterest at end of Quarter\nExploration Area\nCinovec\nN/A\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nCinovec II\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nCinovec III\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nCinovec IV\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nPreliminary Mining Permit\nCinovec II\nCinovec South\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nCinovec III\nCinovec East\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nCinovec IV\nCinovec Northwest\n100%\nN/A\n100%\nThis announcement has been approved for release by the Board.\nCONTACT\nFor further information on this update or the Company generally, please visit our website at\nwww.europeanmet.com\nor see full contact details at the end of this release.\nENQUIRIES:\nEuropean Metals Holdings Limited\nKeith Coughlan, Executive Chairman\nKiran Morzaria, Non-Executive Director\nCarly Terzanidis, Company Secretary\nTel: +61 (0) 419 996 333\nEmail:\nkeith@europeanmet.com\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7440 0647\nTel:\n+61 8 6245 2050\nEmail:\ncosec@europeanmet.com\nZeus Capital Limited\n(Nomad & Broker)\nJames Joyce/Darshan Patel/\nChris Wardley\n(Corporate Finance)\nHarry Ansell (Broking)\nTel: +44 (0) 203 829 5000\nBlytheRay (Financial PR)\nTim Blythe\nMegan Ray\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7138 3222\nChapter 1 Advisors (Financial PR - Aus)\nDavid Tasker\nTel: +61 (0) 433 112 936\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\nCinovec Lithium Project\nGeomet s.r.o. controls the mineral exploration licenses awarded by the Czech State over the Cinovec Lithium Project. Geomet has been granted a preliminary mining permit by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. Cinovec hosts a globally significant hard rock lithium deposit with a total Measured Mineral Resource of 54.4Mt at 0.58% Li2O , Indicated Mineral Resource of 378.23Mt at 0.41% Li2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 309.49Mt at 0.39% Li2O containing a combined 7.45 million tonnes Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n23 December 2025\n) (\nCinovec DFS Confirms Long-life Battery Grade Lithium Carbonate Producer Strategically Positioned to supply European EV and Energy-storage Sectors\n).\nA Proven and Probable Ore Reserve of 54.4Mt at 0.58% Li2O has been declared to cover the first 26 years mining at an output of 37,500tpa of lithium carbonate (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n23 December 2025\n) (\nCinovec DFS Confirms Long-life Battery Grade Lithium Carbonate Producer Strategically Positioned to supply European EV and Energy-storage Sectors\n).\nThe Definitive Feasibility Study (\nDFS\n) confirmed the economic viability of the Cinovec Project with steady-state production of 37,500 tpa of battery-grade lithium carbonate\n(Li\u2082\nCO\u2083)\n, representing ~5.2% of EU demand in 2030 and sufficient for >900,000 50kWh EV batteries annually. Cinovec will have a 28+ year operating life, underpinned by a\u00a0748Mt Resource @ 0.19% Li\u2082O\u00a0and a\u00a055.4Mt Ore Reserve, with expansion optionality (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n23 December 2025\n) (\nCinovec DFS Confirms Long-life Battery Grade Lithium Carbonate Producer Strategically Positioned to supply European EV and Energy-storage Sectors\n).\nThis makes Cinovec the largest hard rock lithium deposit in Europe and by far the largest hard rock lithium deposit in the European Union.\nCinovec has been designated a Strategic Project by the European Union under the Critical Raw Materials Act\n(refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 25/26 March 2025) (\nCinovec declared a Strategic Project under EU Critical Raw Materials Act\n) and a Strategic Deposit by the Czech Government (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 7 March 2025) (\nCinovec declared Strategic Deposit by Czech Government\n).\nCinovec has received recent impetus from the EU and the Czech Government in the form of grants of USD36 million from the EU Just Transition fund (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 28 April 2025) (\nUSD 36 million Just Transition Fund Grant Approved for Cinovec Project\n) and up to EUR360 million by the Czech Government (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 7 March 2025) (\nApproval of up to \u20ac360 Million Czech Government Grant\n).\nThe deposit has previously had over 400,000 tonnes of ore mined as a trial sub-level open stope underground mining operation.\nCinovec is centrally located for European end-users and is well serviced by infrastructure, with a sealed road adjacent to the deposit, rail lines located 5 km north and 8 km south of the deposit, and an active 22 kV transmission line running to the historic mine.

Often, but not always, forward looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward looking words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", and \"guidance\", or other similar words and may include, without limitation, sta\ntements regarding plans, strategies and objectives of management, anticipated production or construction commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs.\nForward looking\nstatements inherently involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results, performance, and achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance, or achievements. Relevant factors may include, but are not limited to, changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange fluctuations and general economic conditions, increased costs and demand for production inputs, the speculative nature of exploration and project development, including the risks of obtaining necessary licences and permits and diminishing quantities or grades of reserves, political and social risks, changes to the regulatory framework within which the company operates or may in the future operate, environmental conditions including extreme weather conditions, recruitment and retention of personnel, industrial relations issues and litigation.\nForward looking\nstatements are based on the Company and its management's good faith assumptions relating to the financial, market, regulatory and other relevant environments that will exist and affect the company's business and operations in the future. The company does not give any assurance that the assumptions on which forward looking statements are based will prove to be correct, or that the company's business or operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not foreseen or foreseeable by the company or management or beyond the company's control.\nAlthough the Company attempts and has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in forward looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results, performance, achievements or events not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and many events are beyond the reasonable control of the company.\nAccordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements in these materials speak only at the date of issue. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange listing rules, in providing this information the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward looking statements or to advise of any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nLITHIUM CLASSIFICATION AND CONVERSION FACTORS\nLithium grades are normally presented in percentages or parts per million (ppm). Grades of deposits are also expressed as lithium compounds in percentages, for example as a percent lithium oxide (Li2O) content or percent lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) content.\nLithium carbonate equivalent (\"\nLCE\n\") is the industry standard terminology for, and is equivalent to, Li2CO3. Use of LCE is to provide data comparable with industry reports and is the total equivalent amount of lithium carbonate, assuming the lithium content in the deposit is converted to lithium carbonate, using the conversion rates in the table included below to get an equivalent Li2CO3 value in percent. Use of LCE assumes 100% recovery and no process losses in the extraction of Li2CO3 from the deposit.\nLithium resources and reserves are usually presented in tonnes of LCE or Li.\nThe standard conversion factors are set out in the table below:\nTable: Conversion Factors for Lithium Compounds and Minerals\nConvert from\nConvert to Li\nConvert to Li2O\nConvert to Li2CO3\nConvert to

The documentation is expected to be made publicly available for consultation later this quarter, with the Ministry to determine the timing for public submissions and hearings.\nScope of the EIA\nThe EIA identifies and assesses potential environmental impacts associated with the Project and outlines proposed mitigation and management measures, including monitoring requirements. It considers physical, biological and socio-economic factors from an environmental protection perspective and incorporates the technical modelling required under Czech and EU regulations.\nEU Just Transition Fund Condition Met\nSubmission of the EIA satisfies a key condition of the EU Just Transition Fund (\nJTF\n) grant\nawarded to the Cinovec Project\n[2]\n.\nIn April 2025, the Czech selection panel approved\u00a0CZK 800 million\u00a0(approximately\u00a0US$36\nmillion\u00a0at the time) in grant funding. Conditions of the grant require:\n\u00fc\nSubmission of the full EIA by\u00a031 December 2025\n\u00b7\nApproval of the EIA by the Czech Ministry of the Environment by\u00a030 June 2026\nExecutive Chairman\u00a0Keith Coughlan\u00a0said:\n\"Submitting the full EIA is an important step forward for Cinovec and follows the completion of the DFS, which confirmed the scale, longevity and strategic importance of the Project. This strategic importance has been definitively unpinned by the ~EUR 360 million grant approved to the project recently.\nEnvironmental approvals are critical to development in the Czech Republic, and meeting the EIA submission deadline was a key requirement under the Just Transition Fund. The Geomet team has done an excellent job delivering this work within the required timeframe and keeping the Project on schedule.\"\nENDS\nThis announcement has been approved for release by the Board.\nCONTACT\nFor further information on this update or the Company generally, please visit our website at\nwww.europeanmet.com\nor see full contact details at the end of this release.\nENQUIRIES:\nEuropean Metals Holdings Limited\nKeith Coughlan, Executive Chairman\nKiran Morzaria, Non-Executive Director\nCarly Terzanidis, Company Secretary\nTel: +61 (0) 419 996 333\nEmail:\nkeith@europeanmet.com\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7440 0647\nTel:\n+61 8 6245 2050\nEmail:\ncosec@europeanmet.com\nZeus Capital Limited\n(Nomad & Broker)\nJames Joyce/ Darshan Patel/\nChris Wardley\n(Corporate Finance)\nHarry Ansell (Broking)\nTel: +44 (0) 203 829 5000\nBlytheRay (Financial PR)\nTim Blythe\nMegan Ray\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7138 3222\nChapter One Advisors (Financial PR - Aus)\nDavid Tasker\nTel: +61 (0) 433 112 936\nEmail:\ndtasker@chapteroneadvisors.com.au\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\nCinovec Lithium Project\nGeomet s.r.o. controls the mineral exploration licenses awarded by the Czech State over the Cinovec Lithium Project. Geomet has been granted a preliminary mining permit by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. Cinovec hosts a globally significant hard rock lithium deposit with a total Measured Mineral Resource of 54.4Mt at 0.58% Li2O , Indicated Mineral Resource of 378.23Mt at 0.41% Li2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 309.49Mt at 0.39% Li2O containing a combined 7.45 million tonnes Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n23 December 2025\n) (\nCinovec DFS Confirms Long-life Battery Grade Lithium Carbonate Producer Strategically Positioned to supply European EV and Energy-storage Sectors\n).\nA Proven and Probable Ore Reserve of 54.4Mt at 0.58% Li2O has been declared to cover the first 26 years mining at an output of 37,500tpa of lithium carbonate (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n23 December 2025\n) (\nCinovec DFS Confirms Long-life Battery Grade Lithium Carbonate Producer Strategically Positioned to supply European EV and Energy-storage Sectors\n).\nThe Definitive Feasibility Study (\nDFS\n) confirmed the economic viability of the Cinovec Project with steady-state production of 37,500 tpa of battery-grade lithium carbonate\n(Li\u2082CO\u2083)\n, representing ~5.2% of EU demand in 2030 and sufficient for >900,000 50kWh EV batteries annually. Cinovec will have a 28+ year operating life, underpinned by a\u00a0748Mt Resource @ 0.19% Li\u2082O\u00a0and a\u00a055.4Mt Ore Reserve, with expansion optionality (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated\n23 December 2025\n) (\nCinovec DFS Confirms Long-life Battery Grade Lithium Carbonate Producer Strategically Positioned to supply European EV and Energy-storage Sectors\n).\nThis makes Cinovec the largest hard rock lithium deposit in Europe and by far the largest hard rock lithium deposit in the European Union.\nCinovec has been designated a Strategic Project by the European Union under the Critical Raw Materials Act\n(refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 25/26 March 2025) (\nCinovec declared a Strategic Project under EU Critical Raw Materials Act\n) and a Strategic Deposit by the Czech Government (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 7 March 2025) (\nCinovec declared Strategic Deposit by Czech Government\n).\nCinovec has received recent impetus from the EU and the Czech Government in the form of grants of USD36 million from the EU Just Transition fund (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 28 April 2025) (\nUSD 36 million Just Transition Fund Grant Approved for Cinovec Project\n) and up to EUR360 million by the Czech Government (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 7 March 2025) (\nApproval of up to \u20ac360 Million Czech Government Grant\n).\nThe deposit has previously had over 400,000 tonnes of ore mined as a trial sub-level open stope underground mining operation.\nCinovec is centrally located for European end-users and is well serviced by infrastructure, with a sealed road adjacent to the deposit, rail lines located 5 km north and 8 km south of the deposit, and an active 22 kV transmission line running to the historic mine. The deposit lies in an active mining region.\nThe Cinovec processing plant comprises of a Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation circuit (\nFECAB\n) and Lithium Chemical Plant circuit (\nLCP\n) in combination producing Lithium Carbonate end products and will be located on the Prun\u00e9\u0159ov 1 Power Station site located approximately 59km by rail from the Cinovec mine site\n(refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM releases dated 26 April 2024 (\nNew Lithium Plant Site Expected to Improve Project Permitting and Economics\n) and 27 November 2024 (\nCinovec Project Update\n)).\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CEZ\nHeadquartered in the Czech Republic, CEZ a.s. is one of the largest companies in the Czech Republic and a leading energy group operating in Western and Central Europe.
